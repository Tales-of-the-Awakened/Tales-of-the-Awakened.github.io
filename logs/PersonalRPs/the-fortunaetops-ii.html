                            [Open RP]<br>Space, aboard the Fortuna II<br>(12/02 AR)<br><br>~Seven
 years ago from this day, the Corpus Obsidian Dice, one of the larger of
 Corpus gambling associations, launched a ship named the <i>Fortuna et Ops</i>.
 A ship of incomparable luxury, and Defense. It’s outside, coated in a 
layer of impenetrable, rubedo-reinforced armour plating. Powerful, 
automated point Defense systems. An electromagnetic field barrier. 
Perfect for Defense against gangsters, bandits, pirates, Grineer 
enforcers, and even Tenno. Not that there was much reason for Tenno to 
attack such a ship; it was a luxury cruiser, filled with high class 
citizens from various colonies, classes and social structures. Anyone 
could get aboard the <i>Fortuna,</i> if you had the credits.<br>Alas, 
the mighty ship was not meant to be. A savage plague washed throughout 
the ship, a tide of infestation that had stowed away somehow- perhaps 
luggage, contaminated food- and had grown into a force that the 
civilians and security teams could not handle. The ship was destroyed 
from the inside out, costing the Obsidian Dice several million credits.<br>Had they learned their lesson?<br>Today, the <i>Fortuna II</i>
 sails through the stars, a beacon of wealth and opportunity for those 
daring enough to wade through the waters of slot machines, card tables 
and dangerously attractive women.~<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>Kapak slammed his cup down on the bar.<br>“Another!!” He cries out with vigor.<br>“Are you sure, <i>yit</i>?”
 The bartender asked nervously, pouring the oversized figure a glass of 
translucent green liquid. “You’ve drank the equivalent of 40,000 
credits! Or 80 platinum, <i>yit</i>!”<br>“Shaddup,” <i>Kapak slurred,</i>
 “I’m not stopping’ here until I’m actually hammered. This stuff is 
weak! Weak I say! Oog,” Kapak burped, adjusting a bushy, brown moustache
 that looked like it had been glued to his cherry red, bulbous head. “I 
can drink like 5 buckets of that bloody stuff they have on Cetus and 
lose my mind for a bit, this stuff here isn’t buzzing me at all!”

                            With an over dramatic flourish, Kapak 
accidentally knocked over his glass, spilling the drink over the 
bartender.<br>“Pah!!” Kapak lisped, “just pour another one... and don’t think that that one counts towards my tab! I didn’t drink it....!”

                            Kapak looked around as the bartender poured 
him another cup of drink. He spotted a wanted poster on the opposite 
side of the bar.

                            "What a fool!" Kapak exclaimed as he stroked
 his moustache clumsily. "40k by the Obsidian dice? That mofo on that 
poster over there obviously pissed em off real good! <i>Ke pooky pike yosep'kitj Alad p'ke titp'k joupp kate puskep oup ot kiy y'tuypy opp atuy!</i> Aha ha ha ha!!"<br>"Yes,
 indeed," the bartender said as he finished pouring the drink, "Kapak, 
the Deceiver they call him. Screwed over Obsidian Dice years ago, and 
they still haven't caught him."<br>"What a champ," Kapak burped again as he downed the drink in a gulp.

                            Kapak looked upwards as he sighed, leaning 
back in his chair. There was an Index game on the screen above the bar, 
which Kapak began to observe.<br>It brought back memories... Vuko, Kuve... and everyone else who would gather together to watch the big games together...<br>Kapak snorted, pushing his emotions aside. The past was in the past. He’d lost friends before. He’d find new ones eventually.<br>He scratched his false moustache and motioned to the bartender again, who poured him yet another glass after rolling his eyes.

                            -Among all the hussle and bussle of a place 
as luxurious as the Fortuna II, there is one oddity that stands out like
 a tree in a grass field. Maybe it’s cause of the trashy clothes, or the
 strange vibe, or the most possible reason being that there is a sky 
colored Wukong just prancing about the main gaming floor on the ship 
with sacks of goodies hanging off it’s arms and tail. The bags itself 
seem to contain various prizes from many of the sloth machines from the 
more “relaxing” floor. However, it’s not just the warframe that leers 
looks, it’s the short humanoid sitting on top of it’s shoulders like a 
child. You’d expect everyone to dress their best for such a fancy 
spectacle, but not this masked fellow. Tattered, dusty and dirt stained 
clothes that look just barely acceptable for a hobo frame the figure. 
Remains of what once was a glorious Ceno armor just cover the figures 
legs and arms, as if the rest got torn off by something vicious. The 
torso is just covered by your standard latex transference suit while the
 figures face is covered by a very silly grineer mask, only their puffy 
fiery hair sticking out from above. How they got in is a mystery, but as
 long as credit is spent I’m sure that the Dice cares little for it 
too.-<br><br><b>Sonera</b><br>“Ah it’s so great! Don’t you think so?!” I
 puff out as I rest my elbows on the top of my frames head before 
leaning my head to rest on top of my palms. He doesn’t answer me as he 
keeps on walking, hauling the many bags filled with my prizes. Maybe not
 with words but when he wants to he wants to, so I don’t pressure him in
 to.<br><br><i>”Yes yes, all is good, very colorful, very pretty, the 
girls are better than last time. What was her name? From the card table?
 Oh – oh shoot! Should have asked! Always forgetful you are, maybe the 
next slap should be for them…no?”</i> I hum in thought as I glance towards the tables, all playing all enticing.

                                <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="17-May-18 04:31 PM">(edited)</span>
                        </div>



                        <div class="chatlog__content">
                            <i>“No, no! Keep for yourself! Last time I lost it all to that corpus kip!”</i> I huff, tearing my gaze from the tables.  <br><br>“Tell,
 tell, when was the last time we were here? Was it not called Fortuna 
back then? I’m sure I’m sure. Ah blast it all! I can’t keep it in the 
flow!” I look down at my Wukon but just as before he doesn’t speak to 
me, just keeps on marching. I laugh at him “Yes yes”<br><br>“Another!!”<br><br><i>“Oh?!”</i> A yell caught my attention, making me twirl my head towards the direction of it. <i>”Who who? Is it a booze addict again? OH! Wait! WAIT!”</i> I yank back on his head like pulling the reigns on a horse, stopping his advance <i>”See?! One of us! Yes yes? Or…no? Looks weird…hm…but familiar…”</i><br><br>In
 one graceful move I twirl back off his shoulders and land with a silent
 thump. Smiling under my mask I hop my way towards the bar, each step a 
bit to far to the sides so that I advance in sort of sideway skips. I 
hear him walking behind me in a slowed pace to make up for my 
not-so-straight trajectory. With one last jump I land on the stool – 
quite ungracefully -  next to the pink thing, spinning around in it 
before finally ending up to face the bar. I call over the bartender and 
order a Maprico liquor <i>”Very tasty, very sweet, shame no pudding but will do for energy”</i><br>  <br>I notice him watching the Index causing my smile to grow wider. Leaning towards him I boom out in my cheery voice.<br><br>“Bet bet! The Reclamation Unit will lead, Lockjaw &amp; Sol!”<br><br>I aim to nudge him with my elbow as I take a sip of the liquor.

luxurious ship spat some spiteful words towards the acrobatic Tenno 
("Bloody super kids!"), but otherwise left her alone. It seems as if 
Tenno weren't unwelcome or rare guests aboard the ship!~<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>"<i>...y'kup p'ke toip uk you sotkey-pookitj atye sopket tottiyapot!</i>"
 The Nidus cursed drunkenly, "Reclamation can SUCK MY DENDRITES. Lockjaw
 is a void-damn Hyena model proxy which should be MUCKIN' OUTLAWED FROM 
THE INDEX. Spinning bullet ballerina of death <i>toiyy tout pejjep kieye ot teyap sappet ttos p'ke toppos ot sy y'koe...</i>" He coughed loudly, spitting a gob of mucus on the floor, much to the disdain of the bartender.<br>"Pah, Claims Investigatio- I mean, what are they called now...? Zenith Galactical? <i>Suykitj tase y'katjey</i> They're the best team in this game. And their proxy is better than all the rest- it's a <i>kiykatye</i> MOA that blows people the muck up."<br>He
 paused his rant for a moment to look at his empty glass and back to the
 bartender. "Don't just stand there!! ANOTHER!" He slammed his fist into
 the table like a hammer, visibly cracking the marble surface. There was
 a sickening snap as his hand rose from the spiderweb of cracks, 
dripping a little bit of blood, with his bones sticking out at the 
knuckles and joints, his fingers completely mangled.<br>The bartender hastily poured him another drink.<br>"<i>You sapa teay'k,</i>
 just give me the void-damned bottle! I'll pay for it!" He snatched the 
bottle from the bartender, planting it into his... mouth hole? And drank
 it. Once the drink was gone, a smile crept across his... face... and he
 politely began to speak in a much less disturbing manner.

 I listen to his blurr fest with a amused expression. It feels like a 
long time since I’ve had a debate about the Index…or…wait…when was the 
last time? Do I even remember it?<br>A loud bash snapped me back and I look at the marble tabletop and his hand. <i>”Oh?
 He’s flesh flesh, more so than usual. Isn’t it a Nidus? Looks too 
skinny and too tall for one. What’s with the fake hair? And mouth? Oh! 
OH! A mouth!”</i> I quickly whip my head to look over my shoulder to the
 Wukon standing a few paces back. His helmet is also modified to sport a
 mouth but it has no function apart from making faces and looks more 
like a mask with fangs. <i>”Working mouth? Yes yes! Genius”</i><br><br>I whip my head to look back at the infested frame <i>”Look look, he’ll fix up right? Infestation works fast, heals the broken…no?”</i> With a tilt of my head I spat back with just as much vigor<br><br>“M-W.A.M.?
 Blah! Too skinny, easily tumbled down, you just blow on it and it falls
 all that fire power just to land face down and blow a grave. Whole 
division is made of softies! Fast but soft”<br><br>Swinging my legs back
 and forth, like a excited dog, I take a swing of my drink and lean on 
the counter top to rest my elbows on top of them before shooting one of 
my index fingers to point at him<br><br>“Yes yes, Index is fun, I like the turns the twists. Kind of like that twist on you”<br><br>My pointing finger tilts to point at his obviously fake mustache. <i>“Does he adorn it for fun? Pleasure? More? Frame with hair? Maybe I should try it on him”</i>

 reached over the counter to snatch another bottle of alcohol from the 
bartender’s hands, who at this point had resigned from resisting.<br>“Twist

 on the counter. “What’s your name, Tenno? And what’s with that silly

New? Did I miss something? Probably…”</i><br><br>“Tell tell, why are you so soft? Are you shedding? New?”<br><br>I
 lift a finger and will aim to poke the bit of him that is closest to 
me, to feel and determine the fleshiness. I’ve touched other Nidus 
models but they never looked as fragile…or maybe this one is made from 
another strand? Curious thing.<br><br>At his question I just shrug my shoulders and take the last gulp from my liquor, throwing the empty glass over my shoulder to <b>him</b>,
 knowing he’d catch it. Since a crash didn’t ring out the monkey 
probably did. I lean towards the infested frame, to say in a hushed tone
 <br><br>“Keep keep, I’m not really clean and it’s a fun thing to adorn, don’t you think?”<br><br>I motion with a tilt of my head towards his moustache again, winking.

 special. Or, different, would be more accurate." he sighed as he rested
 the hand on the counter, motioning for the bartender to bring more 
drink.<br>"Facial accessories are quite nice, but... only when they look
 good," the Nidus said candidly, "That thing on your face, I've seen 
work like it before.... on... Cetus, was it? That Earth colony with the 
big mucking Orokin Tower. There was a young child I had seen there, 
selling toy masks of Warframes once."<br>The bartender returned with 
another bottle of drink just as Kapak finished draining the first one. 
"You didn't answer my question though; your name. I'll start: they call 
me the Plague Doctor," he slurred as he twirled his moustache.

 I don’t think there are one of them around to make things for us 
anymore. Maybe Alad? Naaaaaah, that deranged fart can’t make this.”</i> I
 shake my head at my own thoughts, finding amusement in them. His first 
retort about the facial accessories earned a chuckle from me. <i>”What was he said? Looks depend on taste, yes? Right. Function is one over so no bother there. I like it I like it”</i> <br><br>I
 make use of the bartenders attention and order another Maprico liquor. 
“Ah? AH! Yes yes, Nakak, very dear friend, I pay her a visit every now 
and then to chat and see what she might need from the Plains. Love the 
flares she has, make for some great fireworks and distractions.” I lean 
in again to whisper this great secret to him “And between me and you, 
she DOES sell rugs and carpets, but takes her months to finish one so 
you gotta be up and front if you want one of em…great quality”<br><br>I lean back and snag the new glass that the bartender set down in front of me. I take a sip while listening to him speak. <i>”Oh shoot!</i>” I smack my masked face in a comical fashion <i>”Forgot the name! So forgetful”</i> I blink as I heard his name. Raising a eyebrow under the mask, I turn to face him and say in my cheery voice<br><br>“Oh!

Stoirin – no! Wait! Um…” I glance over my shoulder to the stoic Wukong

that fell on to the ground. Straightening up, I bring it to my eye level
 and look back at the Nidus “Plague Doctor, yes? Bet bet, is she 
hammered enough to not notice your surprise in her drink?” I motion with
 a tilt of my head towards a middle aged woman sitting by the bar to the
 left of us. She looks worn out by up by too much spending…or already 
spent and drowning her sorrow.

 instantaneously, the laughter pouring from the Nidus’ mouth halted, his
 muscles tensed, and he reached out to snatch the finger away from his 
new companion.<br>“What the muck am I thinking?! She would get a 
terrible gastrointestinal infection if she accidentally ate it or if she
 comes into too close contact! That would ruin too much!”<br>Kapak’s hand flailed as he attempted to grab the finger, another obvious sign that he was intoxicated.

are the same, Tenno, sailed the same ship. So come come, let’s not ruin 
that eh?”*<br><br>I glance to the side to see that my Wukong has 
vanished, leaving one of the bags of goodies on the floor. With a smile,
 I return my gaze back at the boys and motion to the bar for a free 
drink.

                            ~The two other Tenno who hadn’t spoken yet 
exchanged glances, grinning at each other at the prospect of free 
beverages. They both relaxed and approached the bar next to Sonera, with
 the first Tenno joining them.~<br><br><u>Sibernetika:</u><br>He began to lower the amp from Kapak’s body.<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>Too
 drunk to care or realize that his new companion was defusing the 
situation in a way, Kapak grabbed the wrist of the Amp-armed Tenno, his 
long, gangly finger wrapping firmly around the device. The Tenno gasped 
in pain as Kapak’s grip tightened.<br>“Aren’t you going to apologize,” 
Kapak sneered tipsily, “don’t you know it’s rude to call someone mean 
names and then stick a weapon in their direction without saying sorry?”<br><br><u>Sibernetika:</u><br>“Go to Hades!” He hissed in pain.<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>His
 grip tightened immensely, causing the Amp to break apart off of the 
Tenno, sending sparks and a stream of wispy, smoke-like energy to drip 
from his arm. The commotion began to draw attention of surrounding 
individuals.<br><br><u>Sibernetika:</u><br>“Ahh! Ah! Muck!!” The Tenno 
cursed in pain, “you idiot! That amp cost me 120 grams of Sentrium!” He 
clawed at Kapak’s hand in futile as it mercilessly squeezes his own.<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>Kapak raises his other hand, his mangled one, and raised it to the Tenno’s face.<br>“Well,
 I guess I’ll have to teach you the lesson the hard way.” Kapak stepped 
on the Tenno’s foot and braces his broken hand arm against his chest 
while pulling on his arm, twisting and snapping the Tenno’s arm like a 
twig. Subsequently, the crowd that had began to gather gasped as the 
Tenno writhed on the floor, clutching his forearm which was now bent at 
an unnatural angle.

                            <u>Drasiel:</u><br>“Hey! You li-“ the first 
Tenno has gotten up and stormed towards Kapak; he bore no amp himself, 
but his hands had begun to glow and sparkle.<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>He 
lunged forward, reaching out with his good hand, wrapping it around the 
Tenno’s face like a mask. He turned to Sonera as he held the Tenno’s 
face in his grasp.<br>“Pardon me, Stoirin.” Kapak smiles apologetically 
as he moves towards the bar, swiftly slamming the Tenno’s head against 
the counter right beside Sonera’s glass. Blood flecked off of the 
operator’s face as Kapak tossed him aside, the crowd moving backward and
 screaming as they watched.

                            <b>Sonera</b><br>I smile as they started 
approaching the bar for that drink and scoot a bit to the side. However,
 my infested friend had a other plan. One of my brows slowly rose up as 
the violence unfolded in a burst of brutality and savagery <i>”Ahh…butcher it is then. No no, too bumpy from booze I say, makes for daring actions. Yes yes! But fun…is it called for?”</i><br><br>I glance at the other two Tenno who seemed to be frozen by fear in place as the snap from their friends arm ringed out. <i>”Maybe…yes yes.”</i><br><br>My
 gaze drifts to the crowd and then back to the Doctor (who?) as the 
other guy approached him. I let out a low chuckle at the other Tenno’s 
antics <i>”Is he dumb? Approaching a warframe of that caliber in 
Operator? He gonna slap it? Spit? Hurt his feelings with words? Le-le-le
 This is a fine show!”</i> I think as I take my glass just in time to make way for the head smashing bit and nod in agreement to the Nidus. <i>”Brutal this one is…I like it!”</i>
 I feel my blood boil for some action, to fight and join in the 
violence. But…this guy took care of almost everyone and now everyone are
 screaming…well those that I can’t really kill.<br><br>With a chuckle I 
finish my drink and throw it in the air, way up. Just as I did, two bags
 fall down, as if from the ceiling, to land on top of the two other 
Tenno. The bags aren’t so heavy that they snap their necks since they’re
 mostly filled with toys, but each bag holds a lot of them so you can 
bet your cucumbers that they’re going to feel like bricks on impact and 
possibly knock them out.<br><br> Following close behind the falling bags
 is my Wukong, who silently landed on the counter with the glass that I 
threw up in his left hand, a creepy smile on his fanged face. He 
crouches down and extends his free hand towards me. I grasp it and he 
hoists me up on his shoulders where I sit and make myself comfortable. I
 look at the Nidus and give him a mock salute

                            “It’s fun fun! But security should be coming
 round fast and I am not really on the clean side. Fight? Maybe…yes no? I
 know of a fast way out”<br><br>The Wukong jumps down from the counter 
and picks up the remaining bag from the floor with his dexterous tail 
but remains put, not making a move for anything just yet. I glance at 
the Nidus to see if he would like to join on the run or stay and fight.

                            <u>Kapak:</u><br>He calmly stepped back from
 the two Tenno who lay on the ground, one passed out from the pain of 
their broken arm, and the other from getting their head slammed full 
force on a marble countertop.<br>He leaned against the bar casually, grabbing the bottle of grog and finally finishing it off.<br>“Nice,” he commented as the two other Tenno received their bags of presents, sprawling on the floor, completely knocked out.<br>He
 adjusted his moustache, which had gotten flipped upside down during the
 little scuffle, yawning and waving his hand dismissively at the monkey 
riding Tenno.<br>“Ah, truth tell, I know a fast way off the ship as 
well, but, ah,” he clicks his tongue, some saliva accidentally flecking 
onto the Wukong’s feet. “I have some unfinished business here. I didn’t 
come for just the drinks, you know.” He rubbed his fingers together. 
“Came to get a bit of cash, you know? Or, not really a little. Quite a 
bit, actually. Tell you what, if you stick around, help me out, I’ll 
give you a cut. A big cut. Like... I shouldn’t be greedy, let’s say 
60/40, majority me.” He raised his hand as high as possible to offer a 
handshake.<br>“It’ll be more... fun! Heh heh.” He woozed for a moment, 
almost losing his footing and falling over before steadying himself 
against the bar.

 barely waited a second as I eagerly outstretch my hand to meet his for 
the handshake, but instead of grabbing his hand I went to grab one of 
his fingers and then shake cause they're closer to my clasp than that 
enormous branch that he calls a hand.  <br><br>“Yes yes! Fun is always right! And well…I could use the credits fir wins”<br><br>I
 chuckled and threw my left leg over my Wukong’s head to rest on his 
other shoulder so that my legs are between his neck for a better 
balance, one of my hands clasping on to one of the horns on his modified
 Macak helmet just in case there is a need of jerky movements.<br><br>“Tell

                            <u>Kapak:</u><br>He fumbled around with 
something, turning away from Sonera for a moment before turning around 
with a brand new, grey fu Manchu style of facial hair glued onto his 
cherry-like face.<br>“There! That should allay some suspicions for a 
while!” He turned and swiftly marched into the crowd of bustling people,
 without answering. He became difficult to track even with his tall 
height and muscle-red colour tones.<br>“Wait...!” The bartender stuttered, but it was too late.<br>After
 wading through the tides of people aboard the Fortuna II, The Nidus 
turned into a corridor off to the side of the grand atrium that the bar 
they had been sitting at was located.<br>Sonera would find him rummaging through a dumbwaiter on the side of the wall, as well as several garbage disposal containers.<br>“Ah,
 Stoirin, you made it! Here, hold this would you?” He tossed her a small
 black box with a big, glowing red button on the center of it. The 
button was covered in a bubble of hard plastic, preventing accidental 
activation if the remote were to drop.<br>“So you see, I’ve been a 
little down on my luck as of late. More than usual, that is. So I needed
 a way to get a whole lot of cash real quick.” He pulled several metal 
parts out of the trash bin, each of them covered in a clear plastic 
wrap.<br>“The Fortuna II only docks planetside once every 26 days,” he 
continued as he opened up the plastic bags and began to fit the metal 
pieces together. “They usually restock on food, recharge batteries, 
refuel the engines, et cetera. But they also ‘equalize’ their vault.” 
There was a buzzing noise as Kapak clicked two parts of metal together, 
the circular module on one of the pieces lightning up and beginning to 
spin slowly. “And by equalize, I mean either deposit their surplus 
liquid assets, or withdraw the deficit amount required to reach the 
‘normal’ point. Usually, with the amount of food, wine and whores that 
people buy, they end up with surplus.”

                            “After all,” he continued, yawning and 
clicking more pieces together. “They’re a business. They gotta make 
profit. The rest of the money they hold onto is for the high stakes 
tables. Some people are fortunate enough to step off this ship with more
 cash than they started with.” He finished. The metal parts were now all
 fully assembled, and they looked like some kind of magnetic slug 
launching barrel. “Careful with metal stuff around the rails,” Kapak 
said as he picked it up. “Could you be a doll and look in that janitor 
closet over there?” He mentioned, pointing to the other side of the 
corridor. “Find the broom with the blue metal handle and bring it here.”<br>He looked at the metal machine he’d built. “Void, I hope I put this thing together right. I wish Isa was around these days.”

 I turn around to face the bar one last time and throw some credits 
towards the liquor keeper, while my Wukong throws the empty glass at 
him. With a nod my Wuking will start following the speedy Nidus, weaving
 through the crowd with ease in a manner of childlike flexible 
maneuvers. But a poster in the corner of my eye caught my attention <i>“Halt halt!”</i> He freezes his advance mid step and I lean, almost to the tipping point, over my frame to get a better look at it <i>”Oh? Is it is it?!”</i> My left leg kicks in the air in excitement, like a child when it eats it’s favorite meal. <i>“Yes yes! Is he famous? What for? Hm…can’t understand that gibber, but there is a large sum on it. Aks? Yes yes!”</i><br><br>I
 hum in cheer and quickly whip my head around to where I last saw the 
Nidus, only to see that he’s missing with a crowd of people whizzing 
about <i>”Crap! Wait wait! He ducked there no?”</i> My frame jerks to close the distance in leaps and skids as it cut around a corner. <i>”Ahh! There there! Oh wait…”</i><br><br>I tilt my head as my Wukong closes in on the garbage rummaging infestation. <i>”Lost something? Or-“</i><br><br>  <div class="pre pre--multiline">“Ah, Stoirin, you made it!

 broke my trail of thought and threw something, my Wukong quickly snags 
it off the air in one smooth movement of his right hand and we both look
 down at it. <i>”Ooooooh It’s glowing red! Is it a toy? Useful in the dark no? Hold or keep?”</i>
 I grab it off of my frames hands and bring it closer to my face for 
inspection, all the while humming “Yes” and “Mhm” as the Doctor spoke, 
not really paying any attention to his elaborate run down as I twirl the
 curious device in my hands. <i>”Press or no?”</i> <br><br><div class="pre pre--multiline">“Could you be a doll and look in that janitor closet over there?”</div>

slid off my Wukong’s back in a smooth backflip. My feet, and the box, 
land at the same time, but my feet thump on the floor and the box lands 
in the monkeys hand as he grabs on to it again. I twirl on my heels and 
hop towards the closet. With a metallic whirr I open the container and 
let out a “Uuu” in surprise as my eyes land on a small stash of credits 
as well as some clothes and the broom in question. I bend down and snag a
 cap that said “Maintenance” on it but in corpus. I grab the cap, the 
weird credit amount in one hand and the broom in the other.<br><br>I hop
 back towards the duo and flick the cap towards my Wukong, he grabs it 
and puts it atop his horned head, smirking in the process as he uses a 
bit more force making his horns tear through it. I put the credits in 
the goodie bag and then skip towards the Nidus with broom in hand, 
throwing the device he’d built a curious glance<br><br>“Tell tell, is  
this pure for the credits? Or a revenge story? Cause I saw a poster of

for the money. They have not only credits in the vault, but also 
platinum. Sweet, silvery platinum.”<br>Kapak strapped the device he’d 
assembled to his back, and began to walk back into the atrium. Sonera 
May notice that he no longer seemed to be drunk. His speech was much 
less slurred, and his movements more deliberate.<br>“Come on now! Bring both the broom and the button! Let’s go!”

Perhaps for whacking goodie bags?” I inquired, tilting my head upwards

soggy with nostalgia, “a Tenno I almost viewed as my daughter, as weird

of old scars and wounds, battered through many fights. The most 
noticeable is the charred surface on my chin which got damaged in olden 
times but somehow fits with the whole half-corpus esthetic. My playful 
forest eyes blinking under the added light, without the protection of 
the mask. I lift a hand to smooth back what little hair I have but that 
puffy fiery cushion doesn't obey my intention at all and just bounces up
 again to spite me. With a pout, I look over my shoulder to my frame <i>”Ahh….nothing I can do there, no no. Let’s hope the cap is enough to fool them”</i><br><br>I
 nod, more to myself and as action for my Wukong to dip his head 
downwards. I turn to face the front as I briskly walk along side the 
Nidus, trying to keep up with his much longer stride “Let’s hope they 
aren’t then” I smirked, chuckling under my breath.

 past the makeshift security checkpoint. "I guess that's the hardest 
part. Now, we get to the fun part!" He nudged Sonera with his elbow. 
"Fun, fun! Eh heh heh!" The Nidus seemed to grow more and more excited 
as they continued down the ship's atrium, passing by a multitude of 
department stores, restaurants, tech demo booths, strip clubs, bars, and
 slot machines.<br>"She's still out there," Kapak said, continuing their
 earlier conversation now that they were past the guards. "Her name is 
Kuve. Quite the Tenno. She rescued me from Grineer forces on Mars 
alongside..." his voice trailed off as he continued to march down the 
atrium.

 rest of the story is a tale for another day. Ah, here we are!” Kapk 
turned ninety degrees against the flow of people, urging Sonera to 
follow along. They entered another side corridor, this one ending with a
 large Corpus bulkhead door ((literally the doors on the elevators in 
game on Corpus tiles)). A Corpus crewman cradling a Dera stood by the 
control console, a black and orange cube pin sitting on the front of his
 uniform.<br><br><u>Crewman:</u><br>“Hey, sorry folks, this elevator is 
for staff only. If you go down the atrium and take the second left you 
can find the elevator to the spa-“<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>With one 
stride and one swing, he tapped the Corpus on the head with the bottom 
of his fist causing him to drop like a doll. Kapak pressed the button to
 call the elevator, and the door opened.<br>“After you, Stoirin,” Kapak 
said with a toothy grin, bowing forward with his opposite hand pointing 
towards the elevator. At this point, Kapak’s injured hand was now fully 
healed- there wasn’t any sign of damage to it at all, other than it 
being incredibly fleshy and anatomical in appearance.

of movement on my other leg. <i>”Smooth! This time I didn’t trip!”</i> I mentally cheer for myself and hop along, beside the Nidus.<br><br>Upon spotting the corpus watchman, I smile and lift my free hand to wave at him <b>“Hey hey! Sorry to burst your bubble but-“</b>
 I stop mid sentence as the Doctor smacked the poor fool unconscious. A

avoid killing where I can, but I'm not above causing very, very painful 
experiences." He cackled like a madman. "Besides, I'm an expert at

machines to me, whereas I am the mechanic. Spent over 3 years as a 
combat medic in the Steel Meridian, 5 years as a torturer in the Red 
Veil, around 4 years of service in the Clan Smooth Fort-" He coughed and
 cleared his throat, cutting off his last sentence.<br>"Ah, nevermind 
that. I was just rambling on. Point is, I live up to my name as 'The 
Plague Doctor,'" he said, wiggling his fingers dramatically. He turned 
his head, spotting another wanted poster of himself taped to the wall, 
and promptly slammed his palm against it, covering it while attempting 
to casually lean against the wall.<br>"SO! UM! ANYWAYS! I guess I still haven't explicitly told you what I'm- er, excuse me, <i>we're</i>,
 doing!" He squeaked, "We are quite frankly, breaking the bank! That 
detonator in your hands will cause a magnetic field to be generated from
 a device I've planted in the ventilation system. The magnetic field 
will interact with ferromagnetic cryptochromes inside a very particular 
breed of infested bacteria that I've been growing for like 7 void-damn 
months. Took ages to perfect. Real pain in the anus. Ah, well, once the 
magnetoreceptive bacteria are activated, they will cause all the guards 
who have been infected to grow large tumors, incapacitating them for 
basically infinity. The guards I refer to have all been infected via an 
airborne delivery mechanism that has circulated through the ventilation 
system. I've made sure that the vault ventilation system has been 
isolated from the rest of the ship. Don't want to bug up the 
'innocents,' right?" Kapak readjusted his moustache.

though. As soon as we're done doing what we have to do, I can release an
 antiserum which will stimulate the tumors to begin performing 
apoptosis. And this is where you come in." Kapak smiled. "I'm much too 
big to get into the vents myself, and the um, help, that I had before 
seem to have wandered off. So here, I'll trade you:"<br>Kapak held up a 
small vial filled with a liquid that shimmered like molten gold. "This 
is the antiserum. You will need to deliver it to the dispenser once 
we're done taking the money. Here, pass me that broom handle, and I'll 
give you this."

seem threatening to the guards, like that of thunderous predator 
approaching it's prey. My overall atmosphere is calm and cheerful which 
contradict my seemingly aggressive approach. My steps are never 
straight, I sometimes pull to the left and then to the right, like a 
drunkard that walks in a wiggly line but with rhythm making the whole 
thing kind of silly to look at.<br><br><b>”[Corpus]Hey hey! My friend kinda got us lost! Tell tell! Is this the claw machine department?[Corpus]”</b><br><br>I
 speak up and continue the tune. My hums and skips fasten in pace, 
twirling to the climax until I come to a abrupt stop a few paces from 
them with a straight military like posture, with hands still clasped 
behind my back as if awaiting for orders. I wait with a smile on my 
metalic monkey face, wait for their reactions.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrIYT-MrVaI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrIYT-MrVaI</a>

 as the Ferrox fires, sending the Nidus flying backwards in a comically 
oversized mass of meat. The weapon had done its job though; the vault 
was now covered in a large, glowing orange patch of heated metal, the 
slag slowly dripping down as if the sturdy metal bulwark was a piece of 
melting chocolate.<br>In the meantime, several of the Corpus Crewmen who
 were now fully infested thrashed about, throwing themselves at Sonera 
with reckless abandon, flailing their arms wildly at the Wukong. None of
 them seem to be interested in Kapak, however.<br>On the side of the 
room, a small squad of Corpus personnel barges into the room, tossing 
several plasma grenades into the bedlam of mutating Crewmen. They had 
their helmets on, and were also in a different room, likely the reason

 cut shot as I quickly duck to avoid the backwards flying Nidus who 
would have rammed in to me and taken me with him. I blink and quickly 
straighten up to look at the vault. With a smile I whip my gaze towards 
where the Nidus went. I throw up my palms to put them like a megaphone 
on my Wukong’s fake mouthpiece to shout out<br><br><b>“OY! Warn a fella next eh?!”</b><br><br>My smile went away a second later as I saw some of the infested Corpus charge at me. <i>”Fighting mode engage!”</i> <br><br>I
 lower my stance and brace with my left leg as I lift my right one up to
 slam in to the chest of the closest infested sending it backwards to 
crash in to his fellow infested and stagger them for a moment. I quickly
 leap on the closest one on the ground and stomp with my right leg on 
his neck, hard, as I grab on to one of his legs and pull on it so that I
 crush and sever the connections to the brain. With a satisfied crack I 
yank his body fully up and use the limp body like a hammer, preforming 
the Raging Whirlwind combo of Crushing Ruin to violently and bloodily 
beat his infested comrades back to the ground. <i>”Ahaha ahhhhhhh I love the battlefield!</i>”<br><br>The
 plasma explosions quickly brought my attention to the side and I throw 
the bloody, limp, half smashed infested corpus in my arms towards them, 
as a distraction. I pause to look where the Nidus went and shout out <br><br><b>”Get your ass up! We have a vault to pillage!”</b>

the ground, its barrel melted from the heat of the launched projectile. 
"Oh well." He waved his hands, and two Infested Corpus paused their 
attack on Sonera to shamble over to Kapak and help him up off the 
ground.<br>"Thank you," he smiled, before punching them both in the face
 with both his hands at the same time. It didn't look like a 
particularly strong set of punches, but the Infested monsters fell to 
the floor almost obediently.<br>"Nicely done," Kapak grinned toothily at
 Sonera as he passed her. "Hit one fathermucker with another 
fathermucker, eh?" He looked up at the vault door, which now had a hole 
almost big enough to squeeze through. It would be a little while longer 
before it would be big enough to physically fit through, but a Wukong's 
ability to turn into vapour would work fine as a way into the vault.<br><br>~There
 was the staccato sounds of lasers behind Sonera as the side room doors

 yell at the Nidus through the hole before I jump out of my warframe and

through as to what the combination could be. <i>”Two 1? Five 0? Try it all? NAAAAAH”</i>
 I lift my fist and channel the Void to my palm with a emerald flare, 
letting go a very concentrated and narrow ball of fire towards it, 
hoping to buzz out the connections and cause a malfunction. At the same 
time as my Void discharge, my Wukong, that positioned right above the 
drone, jumps out of the cloud to fall chest first on top of it to crush 
it with a powerful hug before gracefully landing right behind me.

                            <b>Sonera</b><br><i>“Huh? It didn’t work!? Heeeeeek!”</i><br><br>I pause to think and look over my shoulder to my Wukong before looking up at the hovering osprey.<br><br>“Ohhhhh!
 So it’s those floaties! Yes yes, didn’t really pay it attention” I yell
 back at the Nidus and twirl on my heels to look around the room. <i>”A computer!? He expects me to hackerman this? Technology!”</i><br><br>With skips and sideway hops, I make my way down the rows of credits, eying them greedily. <i>”Soon”</i>
 I grin and stop as I spot something akin to a computer to my left, 
along the wall, in between the rows. I hum under my breath and approach 
it <br><br>“Uhhh….any ideas?”<br><br>I ask as I look over my shoulder to
 my Wukong, who is standing behind me. He lifts his left palm upwards 
and from it a projection came forth. A very messy triangle appeared, 
with multiple overlapping colors and triangles, all vibrating lightly in
 the background like a nervous tick. However, the colors and triangles 
don’t stay for long, as they keep shifting and changing in angles like a
 bad LSD trip, apart from the main one which seems to stand still among 
the chaos going on in the background.

the hole. “I mean, assuming my-“ There was an interruption as someone 
yelled and there was a loud slam against the vault door.<br>“Assuming my
 helpers are actually doing their void damn job! Just to be safe though,
 I’d follow it down! Just make sure you get as much of that money as you
 can- the chute leads to a Bay Area where we can load up our landing

Corpus gun rattled off, creating several dents in the thinner portions 
of the vault door.<br>“Holy muck that’s a Supra!! Uhhhhh...! I gotta get
 to cover! Just- just get all the monies and jump down the chute and 
I’ll rendezvous with you in a moment!”<br>There was the pitter patter of
 feet followed by an explosion sound before the noise behind the vault 
door faded into unholy din of the melee that was currently progressing.<br><br>~Through
 the hole Sonera can make out a ridiculously crazy, chaotic scene of 
Infested Corpus sprinting along the catwalks and tackling Corpus off of 
them onto the floor. Explosions erupted as grenades were thrown, the air
 painted blue as the beams of Corpus energy weapons streamed across the 
room.<br>Sonera could just manage to hear the PA system say:<br>“Attention.
 Lockdown is in effect. Attention. Lockdown is in effect. Please proceed
 to your designated waiting area. Refrain from using elevators during 
this time.” The message repeated itself in Corpus.~

 A light pout pulled down on my Wukong’s face. All kind of fun sounds 
were coming from the other side that I just wanted to jump back through 
and get some of that action! The shooting, the howling, the explosions, 
the gurgling, they all riled me up in all the right places.<br><br>“Yes yes!”<br><br>I smile to myself and jump up in the cloud form as a preparation to go through the hole and to the fun side of things.<br><br><div class="pre pre--multiline">“Attention.

 jump down from my cloud form and exit my warframe. In a totally frantic
 dash – like manic toddlers that realise they have 10s to clean their 
room before mom finds out -  me and my Wukong start hauling the goods – 
along with the slow ass drone – towards the chute, just throwing credits
 and plat in like crazy. Some don’t even make it in the hole and just 
hit the rim and flop over, spilling all around it. I don’t really care, 
it’s all about time now!<br><br>In the middle of it all I stop and look around, more than half of the monny got thrown down. <i>”Good enough? Yeah. Drone got this! Maybe…if they don’t overrite no?”</i>
 I shrug my shoulder and transfer in to my Wukong, hauling the last 
pilon towards the chute and throwing it down. I lift my gaze to the 
drone and then to the door <i>”Yes yes! They got this</i>””<br><br>I smile, a mad grin, as I pop in the tube for a wild ride down<br><br>“WOHOOOOOO”

way in a totally ungraceful manner.<br><br>“CANONBALLLLL!”<br><br>I yell out just as I shoot out from the end of it at incredible speeds, ramming back first in to the off-facing wall.<br><br>“UFF”<br><br>I
 smack it hard and flat, the momentum stretching my limbs as far apart 
as possible, even making me stick to the wall it for a short second 
before I just drop down from the wall face first.<br><br>“OHH”<br><br>I 
quickly jump up on my feet as if I have springs in the soles of my 
warframe, I lift my fists up in a boxer like stance as I take a look 
around to where the hell have I arrived.

although it was empty for the most part. On the far side of the room, 
there was a massive open space where the room opened up into... well, 
space.<br>Various Corpus paraphernalia were littered about the hangar, 
like crates, barrels, batteries, load lifters, and even a few small 
Corpus ships.<br>All around Sonera lay the haphazardly thrown cash that had fallen out of the chute before and with her.<br>Fortunately
 for her, there didn't seem to be any Crewmen around. The red and orange
 emergency lights were flashing however, likely due to the chaos that 
had been unleashed by the Nidus' device.<br>Adjacent to Sonera was a bay door that either led to an elevator, which was likely down, or a staircase.<br><br><i>What does Sonera choose to do next?</i>~

 I look to the left and to the right but there doesn’t seem to be 
anybody here. <i>”Either he was lying or those helpers of his are real lazy…hm…Yes yes”</i><br><br>I
 hear a loud tumbling sound and quickly whip my head towards the tube 
that I just flew from. Curious about what was rapidly approaching but 
then I remembered that I was standing dead front of it. “Oh crap!” I 
quickly duck as another bag of credits flew from it and over my head, to
 the wall behind. I stand up and look over my shoulder, smiling<br><br>“HEY! He’s still doing it! Go drone buddy!”<br><br>I
 throw a fistpump in the air out of glee. With careful steps, I leap 
over the mess of plat and credits on the floor around me, skipping out 
of it like a snake wiggling out of it’s old skin. I stop at the outskirt
 of the huge mess and strike a thinking pose with my left hand wrapped 
around by abdomen, my right arm resting on top of it with the elbow and 
my chin resting on the coiled knuckled of the right hand. With a hum I 
look towards the Corpus ships <br><br>“Hm…I forgot to ask what ship was his…”<br><br>I then glance back at the pile that is starting to get bigger since more and more drop down the chute.<br><br>“EH! Arko! Send landing craft over here”<br><br><b>Adus (Arko)</b><br>“The
 Liset has been dispatched it will arrive shortly…but I’m not sure it 
can get in, it’s on lockdown and the doors probably won’t open upon 
arrival”<br><br><b>Sonera</b><br><br>“Ahhhhhhh…heeeeeeeeeeeeeek. Nevermind! I’ll think of something”<br><br>I
 step out of my frame and we both start – once again – hauling the goods
 in a more orderly fashion towards the off side of the hangar, towards 
the ships. Me and my Wukong stack the bags of plat and credits near the 
cargo area of the hangar in neat little stacks, preparing them for quick
 boarding in the current Corpus ships or if one craft arrives.

Make sure that- OH WHAT THE- GET OFF OF ME...! AHH! NEF ANYO PROTECT ME-

 chute opened suddenly, revealing a psychotic scene. Corpus Crewmen were
 laying waste to a seemingly endless, unstoppable horde of infested 
runners. Some of the runners bore the remains of elegant dresses and 
suits- the infestation must have somehow reached the Civilians areas.<br>While
 the Corpus held off the steadily advancing swarm, a group of about 13 
Corpus and Colonist tourists screamed and ran into the hangar. Looks 
like these Corpus Crewmen were trying to escourt them to safety?~<br><br><u>Lady:</u><br>“Ah!

 enough, the hangar was filled with pleas and cries for help as the

here? There are women and children at risk! Don’t jus-“<br>The Captain 
was cut off as a Infested runner charged down the hallway, shrugging off
 several energy bolts from the Corpus’ Deras, and tackled the Captain to
 the floor. It shoved its malformed, hardened hand into the Captain’s 
face, the clawlike spike smashing through the visor and into his skull.<br>The Runner was then obliterated by a volley of lasers from the other Crewmen.

 smash the last bag of credits down out of pure frustration  on top of

 sudden commotion caused me to literally jump out of my current “skin”

any fearful situation. I whip around towards the bay door, fists at the 
ready. The infested have broken through, or well the concoction that the
 Nidus set loose. They are tearing at the civilians, rampaging, 
screaming, howling, hungry. I barely notice the cries of the desperate 
as my eyes fixate on the hoard.

I look up from the floor to see five people in the broom closet along with me, but all but two are just in the background, like white noise.

His waist long blonde hair once shined like silk but is now dulled from blood and dust.<br><br>“I-“<br><br>“You what? You wanted to talk to them?! You can’t! That’s how we lost -”<br><br>“Stop it now! Or I will throw you out!” Roared one of the others and the boy flinched, letting out a angry “hump” but otherwise saying nothing in return as he goes towards the ventilation shaft to try and pry it open. A girl dressed in what once was a cute summer dress that depicted cheerful bright blue colors steps out from the back, her fiery hair tied up in to a messy bun. She walks over to me and helps me up by tugging on my arms. She crouches down and smiles at me, petting my messy patch of crimson hair.<br><br>“Don’t listen to him, you did good, even the bravest freeze. Oh! Here”<br><br>She turns her silver eyes from me to look at her hand as she rummaged through one of her pockets. She then outstretches her palm towards me and opens it, atop it a bright orange piece of hard candy. <br><br>“I managed to snag this from the kitchen.”<br><br>I make no move, just fixating my eyes to the floor. I could feel her frown as she grabs on to my chin with her free hand and pulls my head up to meet her captivating silver eyes, so vibrant and liquid it’s as if someone put mercury in them and with each twirl of her orbs this ocean like stir occurs within them…you can almost hear the swoosh. </div>

around my head, like a tsunami sweeping across everything logical and 
replacing it with this simple drive, this savagery. Was that a memory? 
Who cares?! It already faded in to the fog once more, as all does. Can’t

emotion, the primal fury that screams for one simple need. The need to 
play!<br><br>“Yes yes!”<br><br>I leap over the bowing crowd and while 
falling summon my Iron Staff with a flash of green energy. Upon landing I
 break in to a mad dash towards the infested. Leaping over the corpus 
frontline I activate my Defy and drop in to a roll that breaks in to a 
slide attack to slip in the thick of the fray, infested tightly 
surrounding me now as I break through their frontline. I slash, I crush,
 I beat and I dice everything that I see.<br><br>With each strike my 
staff grows longer, catches more, slices them faster. Blood, ooze and 
guts start painting the walls and floor, and replacing the sky blue 
color of my Wukong. Liquid splatters on my helmet, they soak and drip 
from my front as I hack through the mass but I don’t really care. It’s 
fun!<br><br>Performing the Rolling Boulder Rush combo I push through, crushing, brutalizing and mangling everything in my wake.

 had become continued to resonate through the ship.~<br><br><u>Corpus Crewman:</u><br>"Thank

surviving crewmen did likewise, and the civilians followed. Some of the 
people wept for joy. Others kept babbling praises to their saviour. Two 
children smiled happily at the legendary guardian that had just saved 
them.<br>The moment of respect was interrupted when an explosion rang 
out through the hangar, ships left and right exploding violently, 
sending shrapnel raining across the metal halls. The shockwave propelled
 Sonera a little down the hallway, but the Corpus and civilians were 
rended apart by waves of fire and metal shards. Sonera had only survived
 because she had been far enough in the hallway to block the sea of 
flame that had poured out, and the shrapnel was not able to travel far 
enough down the hall.<br>When the heat had cleared, all that remained

through the general comms that Tenno could broadcast on.

all, and drenching the hall with entrails, that maddening smile never 
wavered from my face. I lift a hand to wipe the liquid from my 
neuroptics, not that it did anything since my once sky blue Wukong is 
pretty much colored puke green and crimson from the fight, some still 
oozing off the frame and dripping on the floor.<br><br>The sudden cheer 
and praise made me blink out of it, my grin shifting down in to a smile 
as I twirl around to face the crowd. With a flick of my wrist my Iron 
Staff disappears in to green smoke and I offer the crowd a mock bow, as a
 great showman closing the curtain on the entertainment. <i>”Yes yes, keep it down. Do it for them yes? No!</i>” My gaze shifts to the neat pile of credits and plat <i>”Yes yes! Do it for that!”</i><br><br>My
 smile grows wider as I start walking back in the hangar but then out of
 a sudden this huge explosions ripples through causing me to flop 
backwards, being carried by the blaswave that ripped though my front. 
Shrapnel and heat penetrating.<br><br>“Keyk!”<br><br>My back hits the floor hard but bouncing me up to be carried further by the relentless momentum.<br><br>“Ypak!”<br><br>The
 wave rolls me backwards, my neck bending in a weird angle against the 
floor. A muffled “Blop” sounds comes up as my defy pops<br><br>“Ykip!”<br><br>I
 bounce away like a basketball, every few hits my Defy activating due to
 me hitting the floor in weird and (silly) fatal angles.<br><br>“Puyk!”<br><br>I
 finally stop, smacking in to a wall in the hallway, legs first with all
 of the accumulated momentum making me flatten against it like a thrown 
gelo. A a uncomfortable crack sounds off which is then followed by 
another Defy pop before I peel off the wall and flop down on the floor 
on my ass.<br><br>“Uhhhh”<br><br>I groan shakily standing up with one 
hand on the back of my neck and one on my lower back. The pain rippling 
through my entire body from that vicious tumble.

 let out a loud laugh but quickly regretting it as my ribs tug along in 
agony making me cough out at the end. Cracking my neck I look down the 
hall in to the hangar only to notice the lack of people. With a skip in 
my left leg I bounce back towards it to see the situation. I frown at 
their corpses and the smell of burning flesh <i>”It’s useless…”</i> A wave of a unknown emotion hits me, like a river rising up to drown me…what is it? I can never give it a name.<br><br>My gaze then finds my once perfect pile of credits and plat now a even bigger mess as the bags got thrown all around the room<br><br>“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MY PERFECT PILE!”<br><br>I yell out in frustration, my face twisting in horror as my hands shoot up to grab on to my head. <br><br><div class="pre pre--multiline">"Hello?!

 make a quick dash for the arcade and bust the glass to one of the claw

was always music and food in the room, rich couples dining or dancing at
 every hour of the day. Well, not now. There on stage was a group of 
civilians huddled together, all of them either in a state of crying or 
screaming. A few of the survivor men were holding onto Cestras, barely 
controlling the spray as they hosed down the infestation barreling down 
on them. All around the stage, infested monsters sprinted towards them, 
leaping over tables and chairs to try and take a bite of the survivors.<br>On
 either sides of the pile of terrified survivors were Kapak and some 
other Tenno in a Vauban. Kapak had a fire extinguisher in his hands, and
 was using it to surprisingly good effect. He splattered apart Infested 
after Infested, his fire fighting took now caked in grey, slimy matter 
and blood.<br>Additionally, what seemed to be little insects kept 
crawling down Kapak’s legs before leaping into the oncoming hordes and 
exploding in a ball of fire and ooze.<br>The Vauban was keeping himself 
busy by flinging trap after trap into the rows of tables, causing the 
monsters to trip, fall, fly across the room and splatter against the 
wall, explode, get electrocuted and more.<br>No one has seen Sonera yet,
 as the lights in the ballroom were broken or flickering, save for the 
dramatic spotlight that was shining on the stage.~

 graceful as ever, I jump up to run across the hoard, my feet stomping 
in their heads, shoulders, back? With each step I leap higher, stomp 
harder, trying to smash or slow them down at least as I sort of crowd 
surf towards the stage. With one last stomp, I propel myself in the air 
once more and with a frontflip silently land next to the Nidus, popping 
my Iron Staff but dispelling my Defy for the time being.<br><br>“You really know how to trash a place eh?”<br><br>I speak up to him as I swing my staff to decapitate a charging mutated corpus

civilian passenger sprinted down the corridor. He wore a rather 
expensive set of clothes, with a hat that obscured his face rather well.
 At the moment, he was completely unarmed as he ran in a general 
direction, hoping to avoid the Infested. He was mostly following anybody
 else that he saw, hoping that they would lead him away from the 
Infested.<br><br>So, Frez didn't have a very good history with Fortuna 
et Ops, it seems. The first, he had accidentally stumbled the abandoned 
husk of upon after getting stranded several years back (Siren's Call 
thread). Now, after a couple of years of doing his best to not die on 
Eris, he decided he needed to get away from the Infested for once.<br><br>Anywho, you can imagine his surprise when he heard the alarms, and found out that Infested were on board <i>this</i>
 Fortuna et Ops. He had grown a bit better at dealing with the Infested,
 sure, but they still absolutely terrified him beyond the capacity for 
rational thought. That, and he didn't have a gun.

like a golf ball into the growing pile of deceased Infested. “This

chuckled as he crushed another infested monster under the fire 
extinguisher.<br><br><u>Vauban:</u><br>“I have no clue whatchu talkin’

leave.” He said as a maggot crawled down into his palm. He tossed it 
like a grenade into the crowd where it exploded in a brilliant flash of

would come along to save these people so he could escape with a clear 
conscience and a full pocketbook.<br><br><u>Vauban:</u><br>“Damn straight you ain’t leavin’ me behind, fool!” The Vauban said spitefully as he tossed an assortment of his own grenades.

were so familiar and yet so different. They were still clean and 
polished, the decorations still full of colour and not faded. It looked 
exactly like Frez had stepped aboard the Fortuna et Ops once again, and 
then travelled back in time to an age where its glory was displayed in 
full. Of course, the presence of Infestation was the primary common 
theme between the first and second ship.<br>No infested creatures were

 the cries of their victims seeped through the air from all around him.~<br><br><u>Corpus Guard:</u><br>“Hey! Wait!” A voice called out as Frez passed a room.

before my gaze drifts to the people on the middle of the podium.

to the Nidus<br><br>“Oh oh! Idea!” I cut a charger in half <br><br>“I see no end to this but-“ I stomp on a crawler, like a bug making it crunch <br><br>“What if I cloud surf them up-“ shoulder bash another charger to push it back in the infested crowd <br><br>“To the vents!”<br><br>A

could keep up this sprint for a while. He knew he didn't have to be in

really wished he had a gun of some sort. At least then he might stand a

throw the Vauban a mock salute and dispel my staff with a flip of my 
wrist. I quickly dash towards the huddled survivors and crouch down in 
front of them so to be on their eye level. I smile at them, flashing 
platinum fangs at them in a non-threatening manner, which to them might 
just seem opposite as to how unnaturally upwards the “lips” pull on the 
helmet. I take a moment to scan them all, bouncing between the children 
first. <i>”Cloud too slow…</i>” I look over my shoulder to the never ending charge “<i>Too many of them…need for speed!”</i> <br><br>“No worry no worry!” I assure them, accompanied with soft hand gestures<br><br>“You will all be safe soon but kids go first. Two by two, with me”<br><br>I

shoulder to him and nod “Firm, hard, don’t let go” I tell him as I feel 
his legs coil around my waist. I then reach out and grab on to another 
one that I hold against my front, my left arm securing him firmly. Kids 
are light, easy to handle but adults will slow this thing down by a lot.
 I stand up and with a smile nod at the rest, assuring them that I will 
be right back.<br><br>I break in to a dash towards the cleared path that
 the Vauban secured. I stand directly bellow the vent “Hold on!” I 
holler at the kids and I feel their grips tighten around me before I 
slam the ground with my Iron Staff which sends my flying upwards like a 
rocket. My momentum carries me easily and I grab on to the vent with my 
free hand, dangling off it.<br><br>“Go go!”<br><br>I tell the one on my 
back but he holds tighter, probably frightened by the height. I lift my 
tail to press against his back as added support<br><br>“Safe, secure, you can’t fall. Trust”

turns around to help the one I have holding in my other hand. The first 
two make it and they smile at each other.<br><br>“Stay here, help the rest”<br><br>I
 then let go of the vent and fall down in to a crouch with a silent 
thump. I use the crouch position to propel myself towards the crowd in a
 powerful leap, traveling in long two-legged hops, like a lemur.<br><br>“Keep it up chief! 20 more trips to go!”<br><br>I
 yell towards the Vauban as I pass him in the first leap, winking and 
throwing him a two-finger salute. By the end of the second I was already
 back towards the survivors and waste no time in scooping 2 more 
children for the next trip, repeating everything exactly like the 
previous.

level. Perhaps some contaminated credits made their way inside. Honestly
 who knows? But the next thing we all know, we got infested civilians 
running down everyone on practically every single Void-forsaken level on
 this voiddamn ship!”<br>As the other Corpus personnel moved to 
accommodate Frez, it became a little more clear how many were there: 5 
security guards, 3 Crewmen, 3 Civilians in dirty torn clothes, and a 
janitor. In the background, a deactivated MOA sat on the floor, its 
armour painted jet-black with orange stripes; a typical design for 
Obsidian Dice’s custom proxies. The Corpus Crewmen shared similar 
colours on their jumpsuits: black with orange decals. The Guards wore 
familiar distinct forest green jumpsuits that Prod Crewmen typically 
wore.<br><br><u>Corpus Crewman:</u><br>“The Bridge went on lockdown 
too,” one of the Crewmen spoke up as his other two comrades nodded, 
“basically right as the alarm went out. It might have been too late 
though, since no one can get through to the Captain, and Bridge 
lockdowns can only be lifted from the bridge.... so yeah, the ship’s 
dead in the water right now.”

 a sky blue, blood soaked blur that went back and forth from the vent

it came to the adults turn. I can’t carry more than one at a time and 
there were dozens of them so I had to move faster. Every now and then my
 head twitching to the side to the infested as they swarm around the 
Nidus and Vauban <i>”Hnn, I want in! No no! Focus!</i>”<br><br>I drop 
down from the vent for I don’t even know what time, it feels like I’ve 
been doing this for ages. With those lemur like hops I make my way back 
to the survivors, only to find two of them waiting for me. By the looks 
of it a young couple that probably came here on their honeymoon or just 
to spend a day or two just with each other. The man – dressed in a fine 
tailored suit – stands up and drags his wife up with him – who is 
wearing a tight fitting crimson dress – and kisses her on the cheek 
“Right behind ya” I hear him say, squeasing her hand before letting go.<br><br>I
 grab her, bridal style, and quickly hop back towards the vent. 
Propeling myself up with my Iron Staff I grab on to the vent and the 
people inside help her in. I smile at them all.<br><br>“One more, then we go”<br><br>I
 tell them as I let go and drop down. I quickly dash towards the man and
 scoop him up in the same fashion and hop back under the vent. I Reach 
forward with my right arm to summon my Iron Staff and – huh?<br><br>I extend my arm down to jab but nothing happens. <i>”Aaaaaaaaaa HEK! No energy! And no pizzas!”</i><br><br>I
 lift my head up to look at the people looking down from the vent, 
waiting. “Hek hek hek hek hek hek hek hek”* I glance around for the

he was stationed on Phobos, after all. "Alright, uh... Frez Haffon." He 
introduced himself quickly, walking over to the paintings to grab more 
energy cells.<br>"Listen, we need to get to the bridge ASAP if any of us
 are getting out of this place alive." Frez wasn't sure about this 
moments before, but now he decided he needed to take charge of the 
situation. He was still scared out of his mind right now, but decided to
 ignore that the best be could. "Any volunteers?" Frez knew it was 
probably a bit odd to see what looked like a civilian giving orders, but
 he didn't bring that up yet.

 yelled at the Vauban in a teasing manner as I saw him fumble around for
 his gadgets. Then again he has been throwing them out at a alarming 
speed so it’s no surprise that he would run out pretty soon. <br><br>“I-is everything alright?”<br><br>I hear the man in my arms ask and I look at him with that unnerving toothy grin, nodding my head<br><br>“Yes yes, only professionals!”<br><br>I

there are three Tenno trying to save him…I’d say he just spent a 
lifetime of his gambling luck right here.<br><br>I whip my head to the Nidus as he yelled out and watched him throw a weird meat thing up on the vents <i>”Huh?"</i>
 I wrinkle my brows in confusion as I watch the mass. But, my confusion

towards me with enormous speed.<br><br><b>Adus (Dresden)</b><br><div class="pre pre--multiline">DANGER. THROW UP</div><br><br><b>Sonera</b><br>I
 don’t even spend a second to think about it or to doubt the familiar 
voice that came through my comms, he knows the battlefield like a hard 
worn veteran and I trust him with my Oro. I quickly throw the man up, 
towards the tendrils hoping they’d catch him just in time, as a split 
second after the runaway charger slammed in to me. With a violent push 
I’m thrown on my left side and land with a thud on the floor, the 
charger on top of me, clawing and gnawing at my side and arm.<br><br>“FRICKING-“<br><br>I
 use my right elbow to smack the monstrosity in it’s head, sending it 
rolling over to the right. I quickly roll after it and pin it down by 
trapping it between my knees. I coil my hands in to fists and start 
punching it square in the face. At first they were shallow, but as each 
punch landed in the same cavity the sounds got louder, the wound got 
deeper, skin, tissue and bone cracked and spilled under each powerful 
hit, blood and ooze squirting forth in to my face.

was screaming in panic internally, but he had plenty of experience with 
hiding mortal terror.<br>"If this ship is built anything like the 
original Fortuna, the vents should be able to get us virtually anywhere 
on the ship, the Bridge in particular. If anyone has schematics of the

 know, though, I'm one of the only people to escape." Frez explained to 
Elax. Frez had managed to reach the primary reactor, grabbing the fresh 
energy shell his shuttle needed, before getting out of there. "The 
situation here should be more manageable, since the Infested haven't 
taken over yet." Frez was sorta saying that to comfort everyone, 
imcluding himself, but he hoped it was true.<br><br>"So, we have the 
equipment and a plan. All we need now are volunteers." Frez was hoping 
at least a couple people would stay behind to keep the civilians safe, 
as bringing them with could slow them down. Right now, he really wished 
he had actual armor instead of his civilian clothes. "We're gonna have 
to move quickly, if we're gonna make it to the bridge."<br><br>Wanting 
full field of view, Frez took his hat off, revealing his face, scarred 
by years of accidents on and off of the battlefield. The face certainly 
didn't match his normally nervous behaviour. He imagined it would be a 
tad jarring to see his face, at least to a civilian. The plasma burn 
covering half his face, the scratches on his cheek where he had been hit
 by an Infested charger back on the Fortuna, the burn from where he 
tried to contain his cyst before it was removed, and the various other 
scratches one would recieve from plenty of combat.

the view in front of me. The triangle never stood still, it’s lines 
vibrated, various other triangles come and go in the background, the

 like it was drunk and can induce headaches if looked at for too long.<br><br><b>Adus (Arko)</b><br>“Ah

filled speech, each glitch in it’s words is accompanied by added static 
in the projection, making the main triangle buzz out or stretch “Pulle-d
 out the blueprints of zis place, eEezy thing. N-oW, for the paaaAth. 
Hmmm” He paused speaking as he started calculating the most efficient 
way down to the lower levels through the vents, looking over every 
possible route.

fastest way the the emergency deck was to take the next 2 lefts, down,

There was still a chance that someone either jettisoned them already, 
they were broken, or overrun with more Infested.<br>Alternatively, Adus 
would be able to see a slightly longer path that led to the crew escape 
craft fixed to the back portion of the bridge. Unfortunately the vent 
system they were currently in was not directly connected to the vent 
system leading into the bridge- additionally the doors to the bridge 
appeared to be in administrative lockdown, and could only be opened from
 within. Again, the same risks applied to the escape craft there as to

 tapping him on the shoulder and pointing the right way whenever they

them here. Assuming there was nothing there, he would give the rest of

 to back up. He ignored the sounds of the ship groaning, not wanting any
 more stuff to worry about right now. Once he was sure everyone was at a

one on Venus, that frozen hellhole. I haven't seen him for 4 years. I've
 been working so much, trying so hard to make enough money to support 
myself and save up to buy his freedom. But it would take me 36 straight 
years to raise enough cash, and that's assuming Anyocorp doesn't raise 
the income tax even more. So I decided to try my hand at gambling. If I 
could get lucky enough, I could make 30 years worth of wages in only a 
week. And I was on a roll too- I had about seventy-six percent of the 
money!" He sniffed a bit and regained composure.<br>"But then these damn
 Infested fecal-blobs get loose on the station. That money's good as 
gone... but with your help Tenno, I'll get out of here alive to live and
 work another day!"<br>The man's face was wet with tears, but he smiled radiantly through it all.<br>"Thank you, Tenno."<br><br>~The

flatulent wave.<br>"Life Support has been breached by something," Mino 
reported from his datapad, "something tore a hole in the side of one of 
the O2 tanks and it appeared to ignite. Major damage along the starboard
 side. Does this throw a wrench in our plans?" He shuffled his feet. 
"We'll still have several hours of oxygen, so suffocation won't be a

mild interest as he explains his situation with his uncle. A worthy 
cause as any – to help the only thing you care about, or the only thing 
left in this rampant world. How did that feel? Did I ever feel like 
that? It’s hard to gauge, to shuffle and keep hundredths of years of 
memory in a finite box. No no, let it slip, let it go…all but one, all 
but him.<br><br>I smile to myself as he went on. Why? I don’t know, but 
his story brought a smile on to my face. Like when you catch a scent

from where it is or what – you only smile cause you know of the emotion 
that you felt at the time…and nostalgia hits you like a floodgate on

 hey, all good. This here, builds character! A good story to tell eh?

 to look upfront just as the grid came and pause, lifting a hand up so  
that everyone behind me can see to stop. “Here?” I peak through the grid
 to catch any signs of moment but I see none which I don’t know of a 
good or bad thing. “Wait wait, will scout” I quietly say to the boy 
behind me, counting on him to relay the message all  the way back.<br><br>I
 push my hands through the gaps of the grid and as gently as I could, 
push it open. In one swift movement I frontflip off the vents and 
silently land on the floor. I look around as I lower the grid to rest 
against the wall bellow the opened shaft. <i>”No toys? Luck or speed? Maybe both!</i>”<br><br>I
 look to the sides where the pods rest and smile. As vigilant as ever I

grabbed.~<br><br><u>Daico:</u><br>“Here! I got it!!” Daico had picked up
 the Penta after Frez had finished using it on the fans, and was now 
aiming upwards. He fired off several of the weapon’s grenades upwards, 
the explosives disappearing into the smoke. But before he could detonate
 them, another tentacle whipped down from the ceiling. It smacked Daico 
in the head, shattering his boxy helmet while pushing his skull into his
 torso, killing him on the spot. The weapon dropped from his hands to 
the floor with a metal clatter.<br>The unseen beast above them roared as
 the others kept running, passing Frez towards the other end of the 
vents, where hopefully the bridge was. The room shook.<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>“Let’s just run!” Elax yelled at Frez. The Penta was lying on the ground only a few meters away, however.<br><br>[2/2]

                            ~The Infested monster bellowed in pain, 
sending a deafening howl resonating down the vents of the ship. It was 
so loud even <span class="mention">@Sonera</span> might hear it on the other side of the ship.<br>Whatever
 Frez had managed to shoot blindly must have been vital, as the beast 
began to recoil. Its shadowy mass lifted back up the fan room, 
disappearing into the thick smoke that lingered there.<br>Frez's bash was also successful, sending the grate flying back, landing on top of the Janitor with a crack.~<br><br><u>Janitor:</u><br>"Owww!
 Ah! Piss! My arm!! Arghhhh my bloody arm!!!" The Janitor pushed the 
grate off of himself, revealing an arm with one too many bends in it. 
Looks like that grate is actually heavier that it seems. No one helped 
the Janitor up however, instead the remaining Corpus Guards fixed their 
weapons on him.<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"What is WRONG with you?" Elax 
spat as he stood up. His helmet had a mean-looking dent in it, and his 
visor was shattered, revealing the head Guard's angry eyes. The 
civilians he had landed on gave him a small pat on the back as if to try
 and measure whether or not he was ok. It seems like he was.<br>He turned to Frez. "You alright?" He glanced back at the Janitor before stepping closer to Frez.<br>"What
 do you think we should do about this guy? If we get put under that kind
 of pressure again, you know he'd do something similar."<br><br>~The 
room the group was in was unmistakably the back room of the bridge. 
There was a large computer terminal in the center of it, and large 
sliding doors off to the side. The doors' lights glowed yellow, a nearby
 control panel flashing yellow as well as Corpus alert messages flew by;
 <i>LOCKDOWN IN EFFECT.</i> On the other side of the doors was the main bridge, no doubt.~

rumble I quickly hop backwards and watch as it travels down the 
launching rails. A victorious smile spreads across my frames face, which
 quickly narrows in to worry as the monster inside makes the pod shake 
violently making me think that it might just nudge it off the rails. BUT
 NO! The pod managed to hold on and I watched as it got jettisoned off 
in to space HUZZAH! Victory! <br><br>I look towards the civilian that spoke up and lift my right index finger up in the air in a as-a-matter-of-fact pose.<br><br>“No worry, no worry, my Cephalon redirected it’s path towards the Sun…hoping”<br><br>I
 hum under my breath, hoping that indeed Adus managed to steer it 
towards doom and not to fall like a plague star on some unsuspecting 
planet. BUT OH WELL <i>”Problem for another day, yes yes!”</i><br><br>I 
glanced towards the little girl that just ended up motherless and I 
quickly hop towards her, catching her just before she boards the pod. I 
crouch down so to be to her eye level and smile. Lifting a hand I wipe 
some of her tears with my thumb and lift my tail up – still holding on 
to the kubrow plushie as if holding on to dear life. I grab the toy with
 my hands and give it a good shake to get rid of as much blood and goo 
as possible. <i>”Clean clean</i>” <br><br>“Here, he will keep you safe”<br><br>I
 gently say to her and outstretch the sullied plushie towards her. I 
know that a silly toy won’t replace her mother but maybe it brings her 
comfort? Or it will remind her of the day she lost her… <i>”No no, keep hope, keep hope”</i>

 the dull scream that rippled through the vents made me jump in the

                            <b>Sonera</b><br>The moment I saw the end to
  the vent I immediately started to slow down, to minimize any sound I 
could be ricocheting around in all of that metal. Not that I make any 
sound in general! Light feet yo! I approach with caution and slowly poke
 my head past the vent to gaze in to the room. The urge to throw out a 
impressed whistle battled with my urge to stay stealthy and luckily for 
me, the latter won. But common! This is one huge ass room with a LOT of 
conflict signs.<br><br>My eyes dart to the enormous gaping hole and I 
scurry forwards in the vent to get a better look at it through the 
darkness. Sitting on top of my crouched legs, and with my tail twitching
 to the left, I ponder on the nature of the hungry emptiness <i>”Whoa…what caused that? Infested? That big on here? Or a Corpus weapon? No no</i>” I shake my head to myself <i>”Not in knowledge! So the first! Could it be?</i>”<br><br>I
 hum under my breath and tilt my head down to spot the two vents. I grab
 the edge and prepare to hop down and inspect it. But the sudden echoes 
of footsteps approaching made me froze up and my eyes shot wide open.<br><br>I
 quickly flatten myself on my belly inside the vent, hoping that 
whatever is approaching doesn’t look up and spot me. Shows is for 
allies, ambushes are for enemies

 not sure how much more air we got," Sonera could hear one of them say, 
their hushed tone echoing upwards to the Wukong's audio receptors, "But 
considering most of the things left on this ship are probably Infested, 
I'd say plenty. The air leak alone won't drain things too fast, and we 
have less competition when it comes to breathing."<br><br><u>Corpus Guard:</u><br>"Ah yeah, I've read some papers 'n stuff. They say those <i>suykit'j jeitpoy</i> don't all respire like we do. They can move without breathing. <i>Toippast y'teeky!</i>"<br><br>~The
 Corpus team moved into full view into the now empty fan room. There was
 one oddball out- a Corpus wearing civilian clothing appeared to be in 
the middle of them all, his presence a stark contrast against the rest 
of the Corpus' black and orange-striped Crewman jumpsuits.~<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"All that smoke from earlier is gone... <i>sopket ot Otokit</i>, look at that!"

towards the edge of the vent to peek down at the small crowd  that had 
just entered. My Wukong’s emerald energy dimming and my eyes dropping to
 scan each of them through this darkness for weapons. <i>”Yes yes, they have. One, two, three…four?”</i> My gaze hits one the guards hips, through in this blackness that what’s dangling from him can be anything.<br><br>But, despite my unease at the weapons a slow smile started to spread across my frames face. <i>”Friendly yes! I suppose no? Ahhhhh….they will shoot…spooked? But…</i>”<br><br>I
 tilt my head to the side, pondering on how to approach them best cause 
they have ran in to a lot of stuff and are more trigger happy than I’d 
want…<i>”BLAH! Guns! So violent…ehhhhhh! Fast! Yes, do it fast! Like a burn!”</i><br><br>I
 shake my head and shuffle my legs upwards, sneaking them beneath me so 
that I push myself off my belly and crouch on top of them – making sure 
to make minimal noise. Poking my head beyond the vent I tilt and look to
 the left then right, seeing nobody else in the room I nod my head yet 
again and turn my gaze back at  them, looming above them like a night 
watcher. <i>”Ahhhhh no! Wait! It will spook them! But…no other way…yes…no….yes….no….yes….no…</i>”<br><br>Feeling
 enough of this internal debate I hit myself on the forehead to activate
 my Defy which let’s out this stiff plop sound to bounce around the 
room. Then in one swift leap I jump down from the vent to silently land 
right in front of their flashlights, all superhero landing like. I then 
quickly straighten myself up, like a showman at the end of their act 
waiting for applause. Throwing my hands up in the air I try to show them
 that I am not a threat, saying loud and clear<br><br>“Friendly, no harm!”

 My head tilts and I lower my hands to dangle by my sides. At the urgent
 call of help from one of them, the expressive helmet of my Wukong 
stretched far to flash a toothy grin, my voice coming out fast paced and
 excited.<br><br>"O-oh!? Yes yes! I can help!"<br><br>I then clear my 
throat in a rather loud way as if it's a cue for my whole demeanor to 
switch. The smile went away like a candle light in harsh winds and a 
stern look replaces it, brows wrinkle, lip curling downwards, the 
playful and jumpy atmosphere that constantly circles me has shifted 
towards a heavy tone. My shoulders tense up as I lift to cross my arms 
over my chest and with the eyeless visor of my frame I gaze at the one 
who spoke to me last, even leaning a bit towards him. With the voice of a
 rumbling rhino, I say to him in such a serious tone that he might feel 
like he's done something wrong<br><br>"Point me towards the fire and I will snuff it"<br><br>Then
 just as fast as it came, the stern expression went away and replaced by
 my friendly smile once more, showing that the whole shift from before 
was just a silly little act. What? Aren't cool guys supposed to act like
 that? Well...at least those that can fix anything do! <i>"Yes yes! I was so cool there!</i>"

 exclaim and lift the hand from his shoulder, not wanting for him to

 force of a charging Rhino, hoping something gives in.

they're doing." Frez interrupted Mino. After the first Fortuna, and many
 less optimal encounters, Frez had a wierd combination of fear and 
respect for what Tenno could do. He watched as Sonera did all of this 
stuff, and as they summoned the staff. He did back up upon seeing the 
weapon, though, gesturing for everyone else to do so as well.

 be in luck. Sadly, no survivors, but thankfully none of those blasted

broken helmet and set it on a nearby table. He regarded some of his men 
escorting the Janitor into a corner of the bridge before turning to 
Frez.<br>"Alright, well... you've done pretty good so far, son. You managed to get us to the bridge. What do we do from here?"<br>A few of the nearby Corpus Guards, Crewmen and Civilians stopped and moved a little closer to listen.

are down, but we have eyes on the atriums on levels 6, 8 and 13, as well
 as the strip club on 10, a bar on 8, and both the mens’ and womens’

doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of Infested in sight though. But there’s 
plenty of other places that they could be that we can’t see.”<br>Mino drummed his fingers on the front top edge of his helmet.<br>“Unfortunately
 we don’t have scanners installed on this ship. I explored other 
security options, but it seems like there’s some hardware failure that’s
 disconnected the bridge’s access to the security room. This means Senta
 Turrets, Bursas, and laser gates are all inaccessible.”<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>“Mino! What about comms? Can we broadcast anything? Is there any history of a broadcast?”<br><br><u>Mino:</u><br>After a brief moment of typing and tapping, Mino announced,<br>“A

 been struck across him, tearing up the thick polymer jumpsuit that he 
wore. In the center of the slash was a deeper gash, right where the

 bizarre. I can't feel a pulse at all... and his fingers are so 
stiff..." To emphasize his point, he attempted to lift the stiff arm in 
the air to display.<br>"I took a first aid course on Jupiter only a few months ago, I know how to check a pulse..."<br><br><u>Corpus Crewman:</u><br>"You're probably just <i>p'tayk</i>
 to be honest," the Corpus who had called Frez over commented. The other
 crewman seemed to shake his head in annoyance, his helmet displaying a 
surprising amount of emotion- mostly exasperation.<br>The Crewman turned away from the body to face Frez.<br>"You
 haven't heard of Kapak? The Deceiver? He's a terrible... thing. Some 
people aren't even sure if there's a Tenno underneath that walking ball 
of meat. As for whether or not he was on the ship- well, honestly it's 
hard to tell. He's got a fortune of a bounty on his head, and so he's 
learned how to become a master of disguise. But this whole incident 
definitely seems like something he'd do."<br><br><u>Third Crewman:</u><br>"Hey,
 Tenno," the Crewman whispered to Sonera, nudging the Warframe's arm, 
"think after we get out of this mess I can get a signature? I'd be 
thrilled, and I'd finally have something to brag and show off to my 
coworkers!"

                            <b>Sonera</b><br>My gaze drifts towards the 
corpus that leaned over the body to take a pulse, only for him to say 
that there is none. My Wukong’s flexible mask twists in to a toothy 
frown, unsure if I heard that right <i>”Wait wait wait…alive? But not? Breathing? But not? No no…too tightening, too many points not connecting…</i>”
 I glance at the body, as the thought of ending him quickly flashed in 
my head. This situation isn’t standard, and when something isn’t 
standard that usually means one of two things. Either it’s far dangerous
 than thought, or a new exploit. <i>”Or…</i>”<br><br>I listen to the 
talk about this Kapak fellow once more, wondering who he is to have his 
name spread out so much. While yes, I do know who started this all…but I
 don’t feel the need to explain it to them…not the time.<br><br>I look 
towards the Corpus next to me as he whispered to me about a autograph, 
causing my stern expression to lift back up in to my trademark smile. <i>”A-ah! Autograph? AH AH! How? What do I use? AH! Later for that worry! This now!</i>” A simple nod is what I offer him before turning my attention back at the others…and him.<br><br>I
 don’t like this situation, not one bit. There is a dead man that is 
somehow still alive…and I’m not so keen to find out as to how he still 
breathes without a pulse. Sure, I love puzzles and mysteries but not 
ones like this. So, I shoot out my right arm, coiling my long and 
dexterous hands around the throat of the bleeding man, making sure not 
to put too much pressure just yet. My emerald gaze, albeit much more 
menacing than before, hits the gathered people as I say, in a lower and 
serious tone<br><br>“No help for him, mercy only left”<br><br>I wait…just for a moment…to see if anyone thinks of something more rational.

 He recalled the Plaguewatch file, and the encounter they had... 
Watching his team get eaten... Oh <i>no</i>. The moment everything 
clicked in his mind, Frez's whole body language seemed to tense up. 
DCV-1R was on the ship? That's impossible, though. No way Plaguewatch 
could have let him escape Eris. Then again, he was Tenno...<br><br>"We need people on every single entry point, <i>now</i>.
 Vents, doors, maintenance passages, everything." Frez ordered quite 
suddenly. He walked/speedwalked/jogged over to Mino, everything about 
him seeming much more dangerous. "That... thing. 'Kapak'. He's 
dangerous. Really dangerous. Just tell me we have some way of detecting 
him." He almost begged of Mino, as he nervously glanced at the door and 
vents. What if DCV-1R was already on his way? He didn't want to watch 
these people get eaten.

of the dying man. I return my look towards the poor fool, my eyes 
dipping to his still face…what is this? I feel like I’ve…<br><br><div class="pre pre--multiline"><br>I called out to him, holding a pobber floof with it’s belly torn open hands. The man sitting by the foundry segment smiles at me, his worn white face flashing with a spec of color from a rugged crimson beard. He let’s go of the tools in his hands and drops the Moa head he’s been working on. He wipes the grease from his fingers on to his sullied clothes and turns to face me.<br><br>“What is it mo Ghrá?”<br><br>I stiffen a sniffle and outstretch my hands towards him, the unmoving pobber resting calmly on top. <br><br>“*hick* I was playing tag *hick* with Benny and *hick* I accidentally hit him too hard and *hick* now he won’t move *sniffle* I didn’t mean to I-”<br><br>He wrinkles his brows in worry and lifts his bear like hand to gently take the pobber from my little hands. He starts poking him in the belly with his pinky, turning and blowing on the eyes to get a reaction. I nervously wait, twiddling my thumbs as I watch him bring the little critter up to his ear. His expression dips, saddens lightly as he lowers the pobber from his ear and slouches his shoulders.<br><br>“A-ah…you see….”<br><br>He starts in his low voice, his sweet chocolate eyes dipping to meet my teary ones. I see a flicker of a emotion going across his face, and his tired expression changes as soon as our eyes meet, going from worry to enormous joy. His tone of voice hitches up as well, as he practically yells at me.</div>

Actually, his hammer hit a lot! Comically loud! I found my sadness slowly being overtaken by this rising curiosity as to what my dad is doing there with Benny. I stood up on my toes, but even then I couldn’t see over his enormous back. What is he doing? Is he building Benny a robot? Better eyes?! AH! I started tip toeing around to get to his right side to try and get a peek over the tall table. I lift up my arm to grab on to his brown wooly sleeve and tug, the need to know and see what he was doing becoming too great to bare<br><br>“Dad! Show me!”<br><br>I yell out, yanking on to his sleeve harder to try and pull what he was making closer towards the edge so that I can see it. But he didn’t mind me much, nor did the tugs do anything to nudge his hands from the middle as he focused greatly on the task.<br><br>“Just a minute Sonera…I almost got it!”<br><br>I try to use the hold I got on his sleeve to hoist myself up and peek from the corner of the table…but again my shortness proves to be my enemy!<br><br>“There!”<br><br>He exclaims and I heard that last thump of the hammer before he turns to look at me once more with those warm eyes of his and his face lits up with one of the happiest smiles I’ve ever seen on him. It kind of caught me off guard at how content he could look.<br><br>“Here we go”<br><br>He says as he grabs on to my waist and hoists me up to sit on his comfortable lap so that I can finally see what he was doing on the table. My greedy gaze drops to the middle and there…built out of scraps of metal…is Benny. AH! There are those dull black eyes! The little gleaming snout of his! AH!<br><br>I look up at his smiling face “Ah! You made him a metal armor!” I beamed out with joy, pointing at the new and improved Benny.</div>

Sometimes things get so broken that and you can’t fix them…but you shouldn’t give up on them too soon either…”<br><br>I heard a hitch in his voice so I looked up to his face, noticing another flash of this twisting emotion, just a second of it before it goes away from his lips as soon as my eyes met his. Instead he smiles at me, just as he always has and will. He lifts a hand up to run his long greasy fingers through my puffy red hair, saying in a voice dripping with a emotion I can’t grasp.<br><br>“Keep on smiling my little ppeayep”</div><br> <br>My Wukong’s lips stretch apart in to a soft smirk. <i>”Maybe he can…yes yes…maybe he can</i>” I look at the bleeding man and nod my head to him, knowing full well he didn’t see it.<br><br>“Yay kpopip pokkoj”<br><br>I whisper over to him before letting go of his throat and rummage  through my poor gear for a moment. <i>”I know I have one of them uhhh….HERE!</i>”
 I pull out a Clotra Stim and carefully inject it in to the neck of the 
bleeding man, throwing away the empty vile. I stand up and bend over to 
carefully scoop him up in my hands, bridal style.<br><br>I look over to the others<br><br>“No safe here, we must move, now”<br><br>I turn to heard towards the exit

 the wall, inspecting it for a moment. Was it Infested? Corrosion? 
Weaponry? Either way, he had the exact same plan, but it was worth at 
least trying to determine. Stepping back a bit, Frez gave his next 
order.<br><br>"Weld it shut. Weld them all shut. I know for a fact that 
Infested can still crawl through a hole of this size. Completely 
disregarding what DCV-1R might be able to do." Better safe than sorry. 
If there's only a few entry points, the odds of something sneaking past 
them were very unlikely. There was a paranoid glance around the Bridge 
from Frez, before he continued. "Honestly, I can't stress enough how 
much of a hazard he is. I've seen him recover from things that... 
nothing should be able to recover from. I've seen him <i>eat</i> people. Completely. He's insane, and very, very much a hazard."<br><br>Frez
 continued his paranoid sweeps of the room, as he tried to think of a 
backup plan. Shattering a window? He wasn't in a uniform, so he didn't 
have life support. Nor did the civilians. Uh... drop him out of an 
airlock? No, he'll just eat someone again. Frez turned around just in 
time to see Sonera leaving, and was understandably distressed that they 
were leaving <i>now</i>.<br><br>"Hey, Tenno! Where are you going?" He 
called to Sonera, really not wanting to be any more screwed over than 
this group already was. The Tenno was the only thing levelling this 
playing field.

 started pacing back and forth again, trying to calm down. He was 
honestly desperate. DCV-1R could probably singlehandedly massacre every

running out ammo before the Infested ran out of corpses to throw at

 I furrow my metallic brows as I look down at the fellow. A rush travels
 through me, like a thought but much faster to be so…more like a 
instinct, a hunch, a fading feeling that only exists for the split 
second that sets my mind ablaze with alarms.<br><br>I look over my 
shoulder to the hungry darkness, feeling uneasy about this all. ”No fun 
no fun….start already” I murmur under my breath and turn to look towards

separate him from the rest or at least take him to my Orbiter where a

inside with the rest but I don’t leave him out to the infested just yet.<br><br>I
 look up at the survivors, still crouched down beside the bleeding man, 
holding his back straight against the metal frame by the collar with my 
right arm. “I stay...but only to see this DCV-1R“ I smirk.<br><br>At the

 right now. An entire Grineer vessel. "Tell me we have <i>something</i> 
working. Security, guns, short-range comms, anything to delay them. We

 forth rapidly, as he desperately tried to think of ideas.<br><br>"If

thing is purely a pleasure vessel. All we have is a point defense system
 for dealing with celestial debris and asteroids, but it won't have the 
range or firepower to even dent Grineer Ferrite plating."<br><br><u>Civilian:</u><br>"Are we going to die??"<br><br><u>Corpus Guard:</u><br>"My
 question is where the Void all the other Tenno aboard this ship went?! I
 saw at the very least 14 of those brats inside the gentlemen's club 
where I was stationed!" The guard hesitated as looked sheepishly at 
Sonera.<br>"No offense, of course."<br><br>~Sonera would've been 
successful in contacting Adus, but no Tenno responded. In the meantime, 
the body in the Wukong's arms had become passive once more.~<br><br><u>Civilian:</u><br>"We're going to die!"<br><br><u>Corpus Crewman:</u><br>"This is it! I never should've taken this job!"<br><br><u>Civilian:</u><br>"I want to go home!"<br><br>[1/2]

destruct from here, I think! Let's just do that! Muck those Voiddamn 
Zits and those Voiddamn Grineer! Muck 'em all to the Void!"<br>Soon 
enough, the entire gathering of people aboard the bridge was shouting at
 each other, screaming and crying. The only people level headed enough 
to not start falling apart were the valiant Guards stationed at the 
vent, who were looking over their shoulders at the commotion. 
Exasperation was clearly visible through their helmeted heads.<br>The yelling was abruptly ended by a gunshot into the ceiling.<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"EVERYBODY SHUT THE MUCK UP!" He boomed, his arm still raised with his sidearm in hand.<br>"We're
 going to be fine! The Infestation will protect us from the Grineer, 
believe it or not, and all we have to do is sit tight here like Frez 
says! Eventually, Obsidian Dice rescue craft will arrive. Even possibly,
 Anyocorp might send their own ships, since they have a pretty major 
stake in Obsidian Dice. Either way, people will come to rescue us."<br>Elax
 wasn't entirely sure of things, since Corpus greed may result in any 
rescue craft to save only the most important thing aboard the ship- the 
money. But there was still a shot.<br><br>[2/2]

we'll deal with stragglers." Frez stood there beside Elax, having also 
been a bit caught off guard by the gunshot. In reality, everything Frez 
has said was... not quite the truth. Luckily, Frez was a decent liar. 
All he could think about were the many ways the Grineer could make this 
worse. They could board close to the Bridge, or come with flamethrowers.
 Or, even worse, they could all be turned by the Infestation, and the 
group of survivors would be forced to deal with even more than were 
originally thought to be here. Still, though, best to give them some 
hope. "And Obsidian Dice will come to rescue us, soon. They should be 
able to get a handle on things. We can hold out until then." Maybe 
another lie.<br><br>Frez turned around and saw the specters, and was... 
confused at first. Their appearance was a bit odd, in all honesty. 
Really, though, he didn't mind. More guns. More things between them and 
death. Good thing they had convinced the Tenno to stay. They could be 
the difference between escape, and dying here.

knew there was nothing he could do about it. He couldn't stop an entire

                            <b>Sonera</b><br> My hopping pauses for a 
moment as someone yelled out “BRACE” My head snapping towards the 
windows just in time to see the Tenno landing crafts zooming towards us.
 I smile, wide and gleeful, my hands lifting to clasp in front of my 
chest in a happy clap. My excitement starting to rise fast and strong, 
almost shaking my hands from my will to stop this emotion from spilling 
out too much.<br><br>“Yes yes! Adus! Shoot craft Pinklebutter at them!”<br><br>I
 yell out to my glitched companion, hoping he managed to get that! I 
then turn to face the group, saying to them in a boastful tone<br><br>“Get ready get ready! Guests are arriving! Or…invaders?” I tilt my head to the side, pondering on the motive of their boarding. <i>”Nah nah!</i>” I shake my head and continue speaking “No matter! It’s your way out of here so smiles! And places!”<br><br>I
 crouch down to pick up the bleeding man that’s been leaning by the 
doorway in a bridal carry…or…is he even still alive? EH! And point 
towards the door with a swish of my tail.<br><br>“RUN!”<br><br>I yell out and step back, deciding to go through last just in case someone tumbles in the oncoming stampede and needs a help.<br><br>---Meanwhile,
 a Liset craft has departed from Sonera’s circling Orbiter, all streaked
 in various ugly shades of pink. It traveled at maximum speed with a set
 trajectory, trying to reach a point where it gets right in front of at 
least one of the Tenno crafts in a kamikaze way, to blow them up before 
they reach the Bridge---

gesturing for everyone else to follow. Oh no, oh no, oh no... Frez 
lacked any sort of armor or uniform, and was unfortunately aware of this
 fact. If that window broke, he and every single civilian was going to 
die of something or another. Maybe being launched into space, lack of 
oxygen, the sudden drop in pressure... Running was useless, but it was 
all they could do. Especially with that broken door not being airtigh 
(or intact) in the slightest. He was really hoping that none of the 
crewmen would actually brace, because those ships could easily wipe out 
the entire Bridge if they impacted. Figures, it takes them so much 
effort to reach the Bridge, just for this to happen.

 sudden pink Landing Craft that had barreled towards the approaching

ships off course. The Liset- a blue and red one- veered off to the 
side,avoiding both Sonera's craft as well as the <i>Fortuna et Ops II</i> altogether.<br>The
 civilians, Corpus crewmembers and guards all grabbed a hold of 
something and tucked their heads in. Even the Janitor had crawled into a
 corner of the bridge and had grabbed the side of a console.<br>At the 
last moment, before impact, right when everyone on the bridge had a 
closeup view of the Lisets' paintjobs (one was black and red, the other 
yellow and green), the ships veered upwards and seemed to just... 
disappear?<br>Nevertheless, the music stopped.~<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"Wha-" The head guard unfurled himself slowly from his position braced against a large terminal in the center of the bridge.<br>"What happened?

Mino called out for Sonera.<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"Frez!
 You okay?" Elax ran over to Frez, who had made it back to the mouth of 
the vents that had led them to the bridge in the first place. Looks like
 a few civilians had followed, but stopped when the Landing Crafts had 
passed.<br>"I don't know what the Void just happened, but we're alive.

went... Maybe we should use the Tenno to bust open the main doors to the

 paused as I heard creaks from above as well as shouting. A devious grin
 spread across my maw as I took a couple of steps backwards from the

 in here? <i>Seems like the moment things calm down, they just get worse again.</i>

 He whispered to the civilian, nodding to the rest before turning his 
attention back to the source of the noise. Okay, so if it wasn't 
Grineer, and it couldn't be Corpus... it had to be Tenno. They might be 
saved, but what if they saw the civilians as hostages or something? What
 if their objective was to kill the guards and soldiers? It was 
unlikely, but Frez always assumed the worst. While he waited for someone
 to do a motion scan, he stood his ground near the civilians, finger 
hovering over the trigger of his rifle. A Tetra was better than nothing,
 but he wouldn't mind having a heavy weapon.

                            ~In a sudden jarring popping sound, two 
fountains of sparks began to rain from the ceiling. The metal around the
 sparks took on a fiesty orange glow as whatever was the source heated 
it up. The two sparks danced across the ceiling in arcs, ending once 
they had formed a full circle.~<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"Here they come! <i>Jeakoty uk, set!</i>"
 Elax and the Corpus guards moved away from the vents and aimed their 
guns at the ceiling. He looked to Frez, his one exposed eye showing no 
fear. Seems like Elax was ready to make a stand- nowhere to run, anyway.<br><br><u>Corpus Guard:</u><br>One of the guards next to Sonera nodded his head at the Wukong, whispering.<br>"It was an honor to be protected by a Tenno, no matter how short it was."<br><br>~The
 circle of melted metal was complete. After a brief moment, the round 
plate of seared ceiling dropped onto the floor with a clang that made 
everyone jump a little. Thankfully, it missed Sonera, or anyone else, 
but landed only a few inches from the Warframe's feet.<br>The hole in 
the ceiling revealed nothing, however. The interior was dark, made to 
look even darker thanks to the still-glowing edge around the hole. The 
hot metal mixed with the colder exterior of the room, adding an 
additional veil of fog to obscure sight.~<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"Steady men," the lead Corpus instructed.<br>"WHO'S THERE? IDENTIFY YOURSELF! THIS SHIP IS PROPERTY OF OBSIDIAN DICE, A DIVISION OF ANYOCORP!"

 almost a blur, several figures dropped from the hole, too quick to 
count their numbers. One of them dropped directly on top of Sonera, 
something incredibly hard coming down on the Warframe's shoulder. Not a 
lethal blow, but enough to disorient the Tenno for a moment. There was a
 flash of red light and the sound of blade metal drawing from its 
sheath. The Guard who had stood next to Sonera flew backwards, hit by 
something.<br>Something killed two Corpus crewmen standing right in 
front of Frez, their blood spraying outwards as their bodies fell over, 
riddled with holes. Gunshots rang through the bridge, deafening in the 
small space.<br>Then, the Corpus returned fire. Their reactions were 
slow, or at least seemed lethargic in comparison to the wicked speed of 
the assailants attacking them. All surfaces in the bridge lit up blue, 
reflecting the laser fire of the Guard's weapons.~

appearance causing a gleeful smirk to spread across my metallic maw. <i>”Yes yes! The drop! Yes yes! Prepare! Prepare!”</i>
 I inwardly squeal and take a step back from the forming circle in the 
ceiling. I take a moment to look around the room, towards the positions 
of everyone in it, dotting where they all are before this chaos is 
unleashed.<br><br>I return my gaze just as the cover clanked down, my 
smile growing wider, pointier as I gaze up towards the gaping hole, my 
hands clenching and unclenching in anticipation of a fight! <i>”Fun fun! Yes yes! So fun fun!</i>” I lift one of my hands up to smack my forehead, activating Defy.<br><br>And
 just as anticipated – with a small dramatic pause – they came down. 
Something heavy and strong thumped on my shoulders and I bent down from 
the force, bending my knees instinctively at the impact to minimize the 
back damage, making me end up in a crouch. I register the fall of 
several bodies around me, since I’m practically at the epicenter of the 
assault, and waste no time in analyzing further. They strike, they’re 
hostile!<br><br>I reach out to grab on to the ankles of the assailant in
 front of me, or the closest one to me. Using my crouched position I 
yank backwards and upwards, hard, to sweep the ground from beneath them 
and make them faceplant the floor. Smiling, I will use this new found 
log to try and swing him around me like the Broken Bull spin combo from 
the Cleaving Whirlwind stance. Hopefully smacking and staggering those 
close to me.<br><br>---Meanwhile, the Lancer and Clem specter that were 
positioned by the door have turned their weapons inside, towards the 
commotion. They seem to be tracing the enemies but don’t shoot as of 
yet…probably lining up that aimbot which takes forever if they’re on 
HOLD and there are allies and cover around---

peeked out from cover and opened fire with his tetra. Maybe he would be 
able to buy the civilians enough time to escape. They had a Tenno of

 The figure cried out. As Sonera tries to yank, the limbs become... 
water? There’s a rushing sound of a waterfall as liquid splashes against
 Sonera from seemingly every angle. Then, all sounds become muffled. 
Sonera floats for a moment, suspended in darkness, with the lights of 
the bridge shining through the surface above. It appears the Wukong is 
submerged in some kind of pool, which is constantly pushing down 
whenever the Warframe attempts to travel upwards.<br>After only a few 
seconds, Sonera is yanked violently back onto the bridge, dripping with 
water. However, as she emerges, she’ll sense the arms of someone wrapped
 around the Warframe’s torso, and the glint of a metal made on its 
masked face.<br>The return to above the water greets Sonera with a loud 
blast as the sound and light of gunfire fills the bridge, but it isn’t 
enough to drown out the voice of the Wukong’s captor.<br>“Call them 
off,” Sonera hears the voice growl commandingly. It’s a discompassionate
 voice, speaking with nothing other than an imperative tone.<br>“I’ll call my own off if you do. There’re civilians among us, aye? Wouldn’t want ‘em to get hurt.”<br><br>~As
 Frez fires the tetra, the bullets pierced a humanoid shape of... a 
Warframe? A Saryn Warframe, at that. Unfortunately, the energy bolts 
strike not at the actual assailant, but at a strange, fleshy decoy left 
behind by the fast- moving opponent.<br>It’s fast enough to knock the 
weapon out of Frez’s hand. Before Frez knew it, he was standing face to 
face with a orange and yellow Saryn, its weapon pointed at Frez’s skull.
 A Convectrix, electricity humming as it’s two prongs vibrate in 
malicious anticipation.

 Saryn turned around, lifting the weapon away from Frez’s face and back 
toward the bridge, where the Corpus Guards continued to fire at some 
other attacker who had moved to the far side of the bridge.<br>“Hey seester,” The Saryn yells, “be sure not to shoot the windows okay? We all get suck out!”

feel furry rising from deep within me <i>”Hate hate! Fight with fists! Cowards!”</i>
 Anger overflowing through me, surging like a endless wave that travels 
from toes to head, pooling around my mind, griping it with sharp claws. 
It yells like a beast, it screams, it demands for retribution!<br><br>I saw light once more as  the pool spits me out, my ears absorbing the chaos from the drop. <i>”Hate hate hate hate hate hate</i>”
 The words repeat in my head like a broken record and with each 
repetition this unhindered fury howls more and more, crumbling down the 
playful demeanor that once reigned supreme. There is no smile on my 
face, in it’s place is this unusual flatness that tells the story of 
someone who is clearly too pissed to care for expressions.<br><br>I feel
 a hand reach out and grab on to my torso, something sharp pressing 
against my throat. I don’t even register their words as my right hand 
instinctively shoots out to grab on to the wrist of the knife-holding 
hand. In a burst of speed, I aim to kick the knee of the assailant 
behind me with a quick and precise heel-jab of my right leg. If I feel 
that I’ve staggered the person behind me I will use the hold on their 
wrist, as well as the kick, to flop them forward over my back and smack 
them on the floor in front of me. A fast, yet powerful, stomp with my 
right leg will fall, aiming it anywhere I assume will be their chest 
area.

                            <b>FREZ</b><br>There he was, huddled behind 
the console, as the Saryn looked away. This was his chance. He wasn't 
just going to give up. He's lost enough people under his command on 
enough occasions. That wasn't happening again. He had one more plasma 
grenade, maybe he could put it to some use... Those civilians were too 
close, though. Luckily, that distraction from Sonera was exactly what he
 needed.<br><br> While the Saryn was looking away, he took his pistol, 
and ducked away before running at full speed to another console. Maybe 
this distraction would buy enough time to let the civilians run. Frez 
wasn't about to trust these Tenno, especially with the crewman blood 
currently staining his clothes.<br><br>As he vaulted over another 
console and into cover once again, Frez took aim with the the Arca 
Scisco. Hopefully, this Tenno had a weak spot. He fired as fast as the 
gun would allow, trying to do as much damage  with the pistol as 
possible. Anything to buy the civilians time to escape and to allow the 
other crewmen to fight back.

 ground in front of Sonera. But Sonera's stomp struck nothing but the 
floor, as the Hydroid quickly rolled backwards and back onto his feet, 
his movements extremely fluid as they were hidden by a lengthy cloth 
cape fixed to his back.<br>He rearmed himself with the larger of the two
 weapons he bore- the Nami Solo cutlass. Its blade glinted in the dim 
light, and now Sonera could see the attacker in his full glory.<br>The 
Hydroid was coloured black from head to toe, or at least he bore 
extremely dark colours. The only actual colour from the Warframe came 
primarily from the large, glowing red eye in the center of its helmet.<br>"You
 don't want t' do this, my Tenno friend," the Hydroid spoke as he 
brandished the blade, waving it in the space in front of him with 
purpose, "believe me when I say we be not here to pick a fight with 
you."

"HEY <i>CABRONE,</i> CUT THAT OUT!"<br>The
 Warframe raised its hands as it weathered the Arca Sisco's beams, its 
shields giving a faint blue flicker as they fizzled out of existence, 
the lasers not beginning to sear the armoured skin on the Saryn.<br>"If you don't cut that out, <i>mi amigo,</i> I will drop a big spore and make everyone here melt into big puddle of goo!"<br><br>~There
 was another flurry of gunfire, more and more Corpus Guards and Crewmen 
falling to the last Warframe attacker- over by the far side of the room.
 If anyone was watching, they would notice that none of the civilians 
were getting shot.~<br><br><u>Elax:</u><br>"<i>Pie!</i>" Elax shouted as he fired back at the Warframe at the far end of the room. He was one of the few Corpus Guards still alive.<br>Mino
 seemed to have already met his fate. The Crewman lay on the floor next 
to Elax's cover, which was actually adjacent to Frez's own spot. There 
was a gaping hole in the Crewman's helmet, a hefty pool of blood 
encircling his corpse.

rumbles up from my throat as my stomp lands on the floor beneath instead
 of the comfy crunchy chest of the Hydroid. <i>”Ah ah! Close close! But…more fun like this! Yes yes!</i>”
 My head lifts up to glare at him as a amusing devilish smirk started to
 spreading across my flexible mouth piece. I hear him…but I’m no 
believing. I glance down at the dropped knife and swiftly lift it up 
with a precise kickflip of my left foot, hoisting it up from the floor 
where I grab it out of it with my left hand, however I don’t keep it 
there and casually fling it over my shoulder where I precisely snatch it
 out of the air yet again with my special made flexible tail, a motion 
I’ve practiced over the years by throwing random shit over my shoulder 
for my tail to catch. The tip of the longer-than-usual tail curling 
around the hilt, pointing the blade down towards the floor. I lift my 
fists up in front of my head in a defensive boxer stance, while my 
knife-brandishing tail swishes slightly to the left and holds there with
 the blade pointing down, my knees bending slightly in preparation for a
 pounce.<br><br>“I hear I hear”<br><br>I answer him, my voice harsh, hoarse and low, so unlike my usual cheerful one.<br><br>“But look look”<br><br>I motion with a subtle nod of my chin towards the killed crewmen on the floor, making sure not to break my vision on him.<br><br>“You pick fight with them, I assist them…or tell tell, is that red juice? Not harmful?”<br><br>I pause, waiting for his answer. The curiosity to hear his excuse outweighing my carnal instinct to fight…for now.

to become puddles. This was a dangerous Tenno, though. Okay... Frez 
stood up from behind the console, pistol aimed directly at the Saryn. He
 was shaking with fear, and he was at the point where he was relying on 
the pistol's automatic targetting, since there was no way he was keeping
 this thing stable. Come on, Frez. You can do this. Just try to... 
negotiate? Was negotiation even possible? He kept the gun pointed at the
 Saryn, as he cleared his throat.<br><br>"Then... l-let them go... Let 
them go, unharmed... or I'm gonna shoot." Face-to-face with a hostile 
Tenno, there was fear in his voice. Fear, but also just a little hint of
 aggression. He was prepared to fire at the Tenno again, if need be. 
With their shields down, he might actually be able to do some damage. It
 would probably look a bit odd, though, for someone that <i>looked</i> like a civilian to be threatening a Tenno. "Let t-them all go... don't touch them..."

downwards, showing that no hostility is in my intentions as of yet. The 
others should pick up my actions as a cease fire cause if the Tenno 
isn’t fighting then they shouldn’t as well. I might be a impulsive and 
battle-driven buffoon but I am not one that escalates situations that

                            <b>FREZ</b><br>Okay, let's just step back 
and recap this. Everything happening to Frez. So, here he was. Arca 
scisco pointed at a Saryn between him and the civilians. The Saryn had a
 gun on him, and was already preparing to wipe out every non-Tenno in 
here with whatever was in that orb. There was a Mesa holding a Regulator
 to the back of his head, and their reaction time was almost certainly 
faster than his. Mino was dead, and Elax couldn't do anything now that 
the Mesa was here.  Even worse, the Wukong was distracted or something. 
In a situation like this, what could Frez do? Surrender could lead to 
his death, but fighting... that would kill the civilians for sure.<br><br>"Look..."
 Frez kept the gun on the Saryn, and his finger over the trigger. He 
wasn't going to pull it, though. Not yet. His voice was still full of 
fear, but there was still enough of that tiny bit of aggression. Yes, he
 was still shaking. Yes, he was still terrified. There were many lives 
on the line, though. Finally, Frez started lowering the pistol. Slowly, 
as to not provoke anyone. "Just... Please, don't hurt them. Let them go.
 None of them have done anything... Including the crewmen." And yet, 
most of the crewmen and security team were dead. Tenno always seemed to 
shoot first, ask questions later.

and walked into the center of the bridge, running his fingers of his

 in a mixture of curiosity, fear, and confusion.<br>"Me name is Captain Vec Lightburn, a servant o' th' Lotus, a member o' th' Tenno Order, and leader o' Clan Smooth Fortune."<br><br>[1/2]

 funny about his statement. Dimalgo chuckled as well. Perhaps some kind 
of inside joke they shared?<br>"That lady o'er there with the two... er,

eye and a steady hand, all for shootin'... though I've never been quite

 a moment. Silence slowly trickled back into the air, with Elax's

 huff out as I stop four paces from the Mesa, the twirling dagger 
stopping it’s spin on my palm as I bring it up to tap it’s sharp end 
against my metallic lower lip. My empty gaze hitting her eyeless face, 
intently, as if looking for a weak spot in her nerve.<br><br>“What happens now? We escape? You tell us the rest of the story? We dance onboard your ship? Or…”<br><br>I pause as I tear my gaze from the Mesa to look over towards the Hydroid once more<br><br>“…do we hug it out?”

                            <b>FREZ</b><br>"What kind of rescuers murder
 the people they're supposed to save?" Frez asked, with a sort of 
gesture to the dead body of Mino. At least Elax was still alive, but it 
didn't take a genius to tell that the rest of the crewmen were likely 
dead by now. "We had rescuers on their way, already. Then, you all 
showed up... And look at what you've done... same thing you Tenno always
 do. Just kill..."<br><br>Frez actually sounded almost... defeated by 
now. He had just wanted a vacation, and here he was. At gunpoint, 
surrounded by dead bodies, in a ship full of Infested.  There was no 
point in fighting anymore. To make things worse, he was surrounded by 
what had to be some of the dumbest Tenno in the system. Some crazy 
monkey person with little to no regard for the lives of anyone here, and
 a bunch of wannabe pirates. His fault for assuming Tenno would be 
helpful, though. Looks like the Corpus here were screwed either way.<br><br>"I... don't really care about any of your names. <i>Please</i>,
 just let us go. None of us have done anything." Frez glanced to Elax 
specifically this time, really hoping he was just being muffled and not 
choked. Could he really handle anyone else dying today? Best not to find
 out.

That voice that always made Frez worried and scared of stuff. Well... 
that sort of... shut up, for lack of a better word. Seeing Elax get 
strangled was the last straw. Frez has been through too much. He just 
sorta... snapped.<br><br>"And you think <i>we're</i> to blame for some debt colony? You think Elax is to blame? Me? Mino? Anyone you've killed? You want to know what I do? <i>I'm</i>

with rage. He was shaking. Not with fear, just raw anger. "You just act 
like some wannabe pirate. That's all you do, I bet. Fly around in your 
Tenno ships, take what you want, kill anyone in your way. And then you 
come <i>here</i>, kill survivors, and claim to be <i>rescuing</i> us?" He took another step forward.<br><br>"I spent months stationed around Eris. You want to know what I did? I <i>fought</i>

watch him tear them apart. He <i>ate</i> them." Frez was almost shouting by now. "But at least he was probably just protecting his fellow Infested. <i>You</i> just showed up and started killing. You're almost worse than him. All of you. And now you're about kill <i>another</i> innocent."

hearing their songs and dancing along once more, released a wave of 
cheer within me, my smile bordering on crazed territory! But…it quickly 
faltered as the mood in the room got, for a lack of better term, killed.
 Lingual disputes suck out the fun in me faster than a depressurized 
chamber. <i>”No like, no like</i>” I gruff to myself under my tone, my 
expressive face curling in to a frown as the Hydroid and one of the 
crewmen engage in a verbal show of dominance on who has the better 
morality <i>”Boring boring boring! A fight with no victor!</i>” Truly, 
why do they feel the need to voice their opinions and sides when all 
that is fleeting and not graspable?! Actions matter, they do something, 
be it good or bad…words only paint pictures that are pleasing to look 
at. BORING!<br><br>I let out a huff through my nose and fling the dagger
 towards the Saryn with a careless throw, hoping she’d catch it. I walk 
over towards the Hydroid with calm and light strides, showing no 
hostility in my posture nor movement. I firmly plant a hand on his 
shoulder, my fingers digging in to his frame to grab his attention for 
him to see the stern and calm expression on my face, one that silently 
screams <i>Stop boasting and drop the Corpus, you proved your point</i><br><br>But…I
 say nothing, and simply release his shoulder from my grasp – not caring
 if he reads in to what my silent stare meant – and make my way towards 
the corner where I put the poor bleeding fool…who I’m hoping is still 
alive for whatever reason. I crouch down and hoist him up in a careful 
princess carry, turning to look towards Frez, my expression changing 
once again with a touch of melancholy, dark empty eyes looking alive all
 of a sudden.

 pause to look towards the civilians huddling in the corner with no 
where to go or turn to, apart from me and the blood-stained warframes.<br><br>“…survivors too”<br><br>I
 add with a soft tone, my gaze hardening which seems as if another 
Wukong was standing in the room, no longer the cheerful and bouncy one.<br><br>"<b>All</b> of them"<br><br>I
 finish, pressing the body in my arms closer to my chest as if trying to
 keep all of his insides in the right places with the pressure.

Elax’s purple face, “they made their decision. They doomed themselves

 Very well, Tenno.” Vec dropped Elax, who crumpled to the floor, gasping
 and wheezing. It was too dark to tell, but Elax’s throat would be 
marred with bruises at this point.<br>“Trissa?” Vec spoke, likely to 
someone on his comms, “please tell me you’ve cleaned out enough of

down from my torso as the head of the guy in my hands unexpectedly

on the floor, quite forcefully at that, bone cracking ringing out for a

 to wipe the blood from my already stained face. <i>”What what?! It was resolved no?!</i>” My gaze quickly falls on the stupid Corpus that is wiggling the Glaxion like a hose.<br><br>“Stupid stupid”<br><br>I
 don’t even waste a moment to think as I swiftly jump in to action, 
trying to subdue him before the other warframes had their chance to kill
 him. I practically spring myself in to a powerful leap for a full 
frontal body glomp, not minding that I take the full force of the 
Glaxion since I didn’t dispel my Defy just yet from the previous battle 
opportunity. The goal here is to incapacitate him by the sheer power of 
my weight that is about to drop on top of him.

anyway. "And look at what you're doing! Killing people, because <i>you</i> wanted a few credits-"<br><br>He
 was interrupted by that maggot bursting from the sorta-corpse and 
throwing itself at him. Reflex took over, as it tended to do in these

 way. This wasn't his first time killing a maggot with his bare hands. 
When you normally had to save ammo for the big scary things, it really 
was the best way to deal with them. Right before it hit him, he swung at
 it and tried to swat it onto the floor, which would be followed up with
 a stomp to finish it off, if the first bit worked.

 of the survivors may be safe now, but a lot more were dead.

                            <u>Elax:</u><br>The Corpus survivor nodded 
at Frez, still weakened by the Hydroid's prior grip. He patted Frez on 
the shoulder, then allowed himself to be boosted up into the ceiling by 
Quila the Mesa.<br><br>~After Sonera and Frez were also safely aboard 
the Tenno spacecraft that awaited them, the Liset departed from the hull
 of the fallen pleasure vessel. Frez, Sonera and the survivors would 
never see the Fortuna et Ops II again, for the Tenno ship faced but 
away. Sonera made it out, and the other sub-Tenno beings who were still 
alive had escaped the nightmare. Lives, lost. Unnecessarily. Too much 
blood spilled. Sonera knew the source of the hellscape that had formed 
within that derelict ship, but Frez and the others would never quite 
understand why the things that transpired there happened... at least for
 now.<br><br>The Fortuna et Ops II still floats, lost and darkened, its 
halls still filled with the roaming monstrosities born of the greedy and
 lustful flesh that had once enjoyed its amenities. No one would step 
foot aboard that ship again.<br><br>...for now, at least.~<br><br>[END RP]

                            EPILOGUE:<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>"Stoirin! I
 hope you receive this message! Man, I tell you, things got pretty 
voiddamn crazy, but eventually I was able to eat my way through those 
muckers that swarmed us in the ballroom. That Vauban fellow got his 
Warframe ripped to shreds unfortunately, but he's a Tenno so he'll be 
alright. I hope you got those civilians out! It'd be a damn shame if you
 didn't!<br><br>So uh listen, I was actually able to get the money. ALL 
of it. I had some help aboard, and they were actually supposed to meet 
up with you, but I guess you took a wrong turn somewhere, because they 
never found you. Anyways, I think it'd be best if I gave you a good cut 
of the spoils from my little heist, after what you did. I mean, I'm long
 gone now- some unsavoury folk appeared and I decided to skidaddle. 
Those muckers in the graffiti coated Galleon? They're a real ball of 
cocksuckers. I hope you didn't have the misfortune of running into them!<br>Anyways,
 attached to this transmission is 20 million credits and 2.5k platinum. I
 hope you appreciate it! Who knows... maybe we'll meet again.<br>Take care."
