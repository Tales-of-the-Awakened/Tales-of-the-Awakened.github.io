        >&nbsp;<br />-Veiled Tenno Sanctuary on Lua, Barracks-<br />&lt;4/5 DR,
        16:15&gt;<br /><br />~For the first time in ages, the Veiled Tenno&#39;s
        sanctuary was abuzz with activity. The excited chatter of many voices
        emanated from the common room, the sounds of production boomed from
        within the foundry as MOAs and Specters were fabricated, and, somewhat
        more quietly, an occasional mad giggle could be heard, floating out from
        the open door to the bio lab. The mild cacophony drifted into the
        barracks, then into the ears of a lone Tenno lying down on one of the
        many beds, his sea-green eyes staring absently at the ceiling.~<br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1"
        >Everyone was preparing. War was coming, and everyone there knew it.
        &nbsp;It was only a matter of time before the Remnant struck the first
        blow against the Grineer forces of Earth. Then... Muro sat up from his
        bed. He wasn&#39;t the kind to stress about things outside matters of
        the immediate future, but something was eating at him. Something that
        started as a simple, two-word question by his own cephalon when they
        were talking about the Remnant&#39;s larger scheme. &quot;Then
        what?&quot; No matter how hard he thought about it, any next step he
        could dream up only yielded more questions. He swung himself out of bed,
        his brow furrowed in frustration. He may not have the answers, but he
        knew someone who would. Facing no one in particular, he spoke to the
        seemingly empty room.</span

        On any other day, he would have stuck his head in the lab to say hi to
        Kapak, but he wasn&#39;t in the mood today. He entered the lounge space
        quietly, trying to avoid talking with any of the other Tenno that were
        hanging around. Fortunately for him, his true form was quite a bit
        smaller and less conspicuous than his Hydroid, allowing him to sneak
        around the far end of the room without drawing much attention to
        himself. Upon arriving in the kitchen proper, He noticed Mata standing
        at one of the counters, preparing some small confection. Although he was
        sure Mata heard him approach, he tried to make his presence known.
        Clearing his throat, he spoke quietly, his tone lacking his normal
        exuberance.</span

        his hand and started walking up to the now landed capsule, which opened
        to reveal Muro&#39;s Atlas. A tall, slate-grey colored creation, This
        Atlas was not used terribly often by Muro, as it lacked the support
        qualities that his role frequently required. Nonetheless, it was a very
        useful frame to have for situations in which he would be fighting alone,
        or where a more... direct approach was necessary. With a slight
        flourish, Muro transferred into the frame and stepped away from the
        capsule, stretching the Warframe&#39;s slightly stiffed limbs to get the
        metaphorical cobwebs out. Turning his gaze back towards Mata, he clapped
        his hands together once, as Mata had observed the whole exchange rather
        quietly. &quot;Right! Let&#39;s continue!&quot;</span

        the many more that were still sealed. It worried him, to be truthful.
        They were his friends, family even, and he had no idea when they would
        awaken, if they ever would. He strode over to his own pod, before

        need more benevolence in their leadership, especially now. The
        infestation hangs just around the corner everywhere, and the Sentients
        could return at any time. If we are forced to divide out attention
        between the Corpus and Grineer forces, the Sentients could very well
        gain a significant upper hand and do irreparable da!age to the system.
        Therefore, I hope we are able to liberate and unit at least some planets
        in this system before something like that happens.&quot;</span

        would gladly help you slay them. So why not take them out first?
        We&#39;re not an army Boss, we&#39;re a ragtag group of assassins, at
        best. Wouldn&#39;t make sense to act like it? Take out the heads, in
        order to break up the forces they command?&quot; </span

        >&nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re wrong about me, Boss. I&#39;m not tired of
        fighting, just fighting other people&#39;s battles FOR them. My job is
        to keep my family alive, always has been. If you&#39;re not stopping at
        Earth, I&#39;m not either. I may not agree with you on your plan, but
        for now, that doesn&#39;t matter. The way you&#39;re planning on doing
        things, you&#39;re going to need me around.&quot; &nbsp;</span

        slightly. There was a certain desperation at the very edge of his voice,
        as if he could see something in his own mind, something that terrified
        him.</span

        is to I filtrate the Kuva Fortress&#39; data vaults to seize all the
        genetic material, blueprints, and everything connected to the cloning of
        their critical leaders After that, we will lock down the Solar Rails to
        Earth and send sabotage teams to destroy the Grineer vessels orbiting
        the planet and all of the Grineer cloning and weapons production
        facilities on the planet simultaneously. Once they have no way to
        replenish their numbers and weapons, we will eliminate Vay Hek once and

        >Muro:<br />* He stood there and absorbed all that Mata told him, his
        brow creasing with worry as he eased his grip. &nbsp;The plan sounded
        simple enough, the way he described it, but Muro knew well enough that
        simple almost never meant easy. &nbsp;The idea of killing Vay Hek
        especially caught Muro&#39;s attention. He knew he had heard that name
        before. If he remembered rightly, that was the blowhard that controlled
        Grineer forces on earth. Ugly, even by the already low standards of
        Grineer. Still, killing him, while helpful to their cause, would have
        serious consequences. &nbsp;All that aside, Mata&#39;s story about his
        lost friends struck a chord with him. Muro had never heard that tale
        before, &#39;Probably for a good reason.&#39; He thought to himself. He
        knew full well that his leader had a tendency for getting a little
        carried away with his plans and ambitions, but with those memories as an
        anchor, maybe things would turn out alright after all. &nbsp;Taking a
        step back, he shook his head.*<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t think the
        other Tenno would attack us. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense. As you
        said, most of them probably want him dead as badly as we do. If I had to
        guess, they&#39;d probably just be mad that they&#39;re stuck on Earth
        for a while.&quot; </span
