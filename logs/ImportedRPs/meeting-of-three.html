        today&#39;s discussion are no laughing matter. My Mistress is rather
        adamant about &quot;planting a seed of progress in the soil of this
        alliance&quot;, as she put it. A bit of forewarnings though. My Mistress
        is a part of very old Orokin Bloodline. A Royalty, you could say. I was
        chosen to be her bodyguard after i became Tenno. Other Tenno would
        rather kill the little girl in order to &quot;end the Orokin Masters for
        good&quot;. That is why i don&#39;t see eye to eye with most of them.
        But i believe you would be different on that account. You&#39;ve proven
        to be different from them from the beginning. &quot;</span

        just speaking your thoughts. But yeah, that is the answer for your
        question. Now its time for mine. Why do you think that you are capable
        of ending such a long war? Besides being a part of some secret group of
        Tenno during the Old War.&quot;</span

        it is, mistress?&quot;<br /><br />&lt;Lyria&gt;<br />&quot;Fine... Like

      ><span class="c2 c1"
        ><br /><br />Dormin:<br />&quot;Me and my mistress as of right now could
        be considered your hostages of sorts. Cause you are the only one who has
        any tangible plan to bring things to peace, while any other would ignore
        such a notion or pervert it for their own purpose. Basically if we out
        there &nbsp;- we are either forced into hiding on our Orbiter till the
        day we die or I&#39;m killed and she - slaughtered for her blood and
        organs. We are not gonna be a deadweight. Lyria can provide to your
        cause in a way that no other Tenno could. ArZalor is an old bloodline.
        Sektarus Bloodline. If you have a plan that will work - all benefits of
        us being in your service are yours. I don&#39;t think i need to describe
        the exact things she could do for your cause.&quot;</span

        taking place at all. We&#39;ve been awake only for a couple of months.
        All those statues are result of our intrusion into some of the Towers.
        We basically survived of selling them on the black market. &quot;<br /><br />Dormin:<br /></span

        see, I take a great risk in providing you with my services. But it&#39;s
        the only way in which i would not be marked as a &quot; thing of
        value&quot; or &quot;potential enemy&quot;. I don&#39;t know what Orokin
        did to most of the Tenno, i was too young to be allowed to know that.
        But i saw what my parents did to Dormin. Believe me when i say that I
        don&#39;t want to see anyone chained up like a dog forced to serve,
        Tenno or anyone else.&quot;</span

        - &quot;topics of today&#39;s discussion are no laughing matter.&quot;
        During such a war - rarely there is a time for a joke. Anyway, merchants
        are easy enough to deal with. Hit the wallet and they will beg for
        mercy. We just need to find the hole in that wallet. If they run out of
        money, the whole thing will crumble, and whoever fights for them will
        find some other employer.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;Lyria&gt;<br />&quot;I
        was thinking the same thing but... Grineer Queens? If i remember
        correctly there were no women models in Grineer production.&quot;</span

        the Orokin Towers, we found a little preserved stash of old Orokin
        alcoholic beverages. Wine in particular. More or less a recreational
        thing, really tasty. And not getting into your head. At least if you not
        drinking it two bottles in a row. &quot;</span
