Eurasian Zone Shores, Plains of Eidolon, Earth
(1/01 AR: 24 hours after Orokin Remnant Tower Siege)

~The sky was brilliant blue, contrasted only by the pure white, wispy clouds, and the dark, sinister plumes of smoke rising from the sea. Over the ocean, an enormous Orokin Tower ship creaked and groaned, water slowly rising along its flank, promising eventual and imminent submergence.
Upon the rocky shore stood a figure, a tall bodied one that would have normally stood proud over such a majestic view, but was slumped over now. Accompanying his side were 2 short, squat creatures that held their forearms close to each other, shuffling nervously and periodically shooting curious glances at the large Warframe, the Nidus.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
Kapak looked behind him, piles of bodies lined up in rows, their faces covered by white linen. Too many dead for too long. They were beyond his help. Kapak could heal all wounds, but death was the one thing he could not undo. Their Oro extinguished, their bodies already cold and stiff.
Kapak kept his eyes focused on the rough sea, his neuroptics peeled for any sign of life.
There was a burble as a third short, midget-like creature lined up another body in the rows, a female Tenno wearing tough combat armour that hadn’t done anything to protect her from the Void Pulse. In her hands, a string of Dax prayer beads lay, clasped in her rigor mortus induced, iron grip. Sigyn joined the list of confirmed dead in Kapak’s mental list.

((To everyone else in this RP, you can have your character alive already and arrive via landing craft, or your character can be found injured/unconscious in the water etc))</span>

With a gutteral roar, The Strider&#39;s Mantis broke through the heavens like a meteor; its hull peeled to an ashen hue, an impulse thruster flickered as it turned in for a hard brake beside the beach, sending a few waves to break the shoreline.

Its leg struts swivelled and pierced the earth, bracing the landing craft up nearby the line of bodies. 

The ramp hissed and popped in a grossly metallic tune that implied severe damage within, despite the otherwise pristine, if not stripped, appearance of the vessels exterior.
There was a loud thunk, as the ramp was pushed downwards and The Strider, still bedecked in battle attire, strode down in both grace and shame.

Damage from the forray upon the Balor Fomorian still glimmered, though the subtle glow matched the starscape of lights that pocked The Strider&#39;s evermore damaged Loki Prime.
His Sydon still hummed with energy, and cast a dusky second sun&#39;s light across the water as he approached Kapak and the corpses.
&quot;W-w-we were not : Successful, good enough, fast eno-o-ough?&quot;

The Strider&#39;s Vox, and indeed, the rest of his prosthetics seemed to struggle to keep up now. His joints glowed a soft orange light, where the metal acted as a conduit for void energy. Steam actively spilled out of his gill-like vents, and from those glowing limbs.

He stepped from one foot to the other, his knee hitching and dragging across the stones as he looked across the bodies with a lost, desparaged look.

&quot;Already?&quot;
Lekalis continued to question, more to himself as he took slower steps towards Sigyn&#39;s corpse. His Sydon slipped free from his good hand and buried itself in the pebbles as he made to stand beside Kapak, peering down at the Unairu Tenno&#39;s veil.

&quot;There are more.&quot;
A statement, more than a question, he looked off to the Orokin Tower Ship; his fingers flexing anxiously, his head wobbled to one shoulder as his hitched knee shuddered and gave in, the Loki Prime sitting down, overwhelmed.
&quot;O... Kay.&quot;
With shaky hands, he struggled to produce an iron cannister and cup; the cup fell out of his prosthetic hand almost immediately, and the cannister had been turned to scrap from the cap down.</span>

“Strider, my friend,” Kapak said, putting his hand on Lekalis’ shoulder with a firm, friendly squeeze. “I’m glad to see you’re still alright, at least for the most part. It wasn’t our fault. The decision made to advance on Earth was a poor choice.”
Kapak tilted his head at the strained whirring from his prosthetics. “I wish I could help you with all this, but you know I’m not much of a wizard in the world of machines.”
Kapak nodded behind him, revealing a larger pile of bodies, stacked with reckless abandon to a height of nearly 4 meters, comprised of humanoid figures in bloated metal armour.
“All Grineer from the assault,” Kapak said as he lowered his hand, crouching down to pick up the cup that had dropped. “Perhaps you can salvage some of their life support modules and prosthetics for parts to help repair your Warframe?”
Kapak sighed as he covered Sigyn’s face along with the others. “So far I’ve found the bodies of Orokino, Sigyn, Mistaya, among others. Their bodies and Grineer alike have been popping up onto the surface all night that I’ve been here.” To emphasize his point, two of Kapak’s engineers passed them by, dragging a headless Grineer Butcher by the legs towards the pile.
“I spent the night fighting off Eidolon freaks in order to stay vigilant in my search for any survivors. I hope I didn’t miss any.”

&quot;Found her last night,&quot; he said solemnly. &quot;She&#39;s the latest Tenno I managed to recover thus far.&quot;
Isa&#39;s face was covered in a major scarring of flesh, similar to the appearance of the Somatic markings that many Tenno bore. The girl&#39;s face was almost indistinguishable thanks to the strange colouration and warped flesh that sat upon it. Something told Lekalis that more of the same injuries lay beneath the linen that lay across her chest.
&quot;Dead like the others.&quot;</span>

<em>The Strider quickly rose his good arm to dismiss Kapak&#39;s attempt to grab his shoulder, bringing a knee up in smooth locomotion, he doubly brought the good hand down to pull the prayer beads away from Sigyn&#39;s corpse.</em>
&quot;There is nothing to help, Kapak. But I am : Grateful, Hopeful, Understanding...&quot;

<em>He rose now in fluid ease, whatever had perturbed his motions with stiffness had abated with the last expulsions of steam from his vents.  His good hand&#39;s fingers wriggled as they let the sphere of the beads play between his fingers and in his palm.</em>

&quot;... I will reap trophies, not repairs.&quot;

<em>He mused, his staticky tune subsided, matching the subtle crush and sigh of the waves nearby. Lekalis turned to face Kapak, watching his finger point to Isa, he moved to approach her corpse too.</em>

&quot;I will remember them, it is the least I can do.&quot;

<em>He explained, squatting down beside the small fragile and battered frame of Isa. He reached out and curled his fingers across her cheek, as if he could still remember its contours and smallest of smiles.
A finger wrapped her hair around his finger, while another held her scalp in place as he rather brutishly tore a lock of hair from her head.</em>

&quot;And you : Kapak, Comrade, Doctor... How do you fare?&quot;

<em>He rose again, tossing aside the broken canister, Lekalis turned to face Kapak with the same ceaseless glimmer in the Strider&#39;s Sunny Eye. His gaze held steady on the larger Nidus, his tone curious and chipper as per quo... Lekalis bound the beads around his own neck with a single easy toss and saw to binding either end of Isa&#39;s hair...</em></span>

He sighed and gave a pained smile. &quot;I&#39;m alright. In the physical sense anyways. I can heal from pretty much anything.&quot; He held out the cup to Lekalis, in an offer to return it.
&quot;It&#39;s just... everytime I make new allies, I seem to lose them just as fast. I keep looking out onto these waters, and I daydream seeing Devros riding on the back of his giant oaf, or Disruptis rising awkwardly from the water in his archwing... but then I snap back to reality, seeing all these lost ones here.&quot; He turned to look upon his collection of corpses once again.
&quot;Still haven&#39;t seen Bossma- I mean, Mataeru. Haven&#39;t seen Vuko either. I know Dormin and the Sectarus bailed on us as soon as Vay Hek broadcasted his ugly muckin&#39; face.&quot;
The distant rumbling of Dargyn engines resonated throughout the sky.
&quot;Won&#39;t be long until the Grineer begin to descend upon this mess. They&#39;ll probably strip the remains of the tower of whatever Orokin tech they can get their grubby, greasy hands on. I&#39;m going to stick around for another eight-ish hours, in case more appear.&quot;</span>

&quot;They are not lost if you keep them here...&quot;

&quot;... Anaheidr. The Heart. Hold the Love close, it is where the lost can find a home again.&quot;
<em>The Strider hummed happily and looked out to the waters again, giving the cup another little toss in his palm as his prosthetic arm rested itself behind his back.</em>

&quot;Disruptis never gave me my cup back...&quot;
<em>He mused with a pang of sadness as he caught the cup one last time and looked at the gruel that coated the parts of the cup that had pressed against Kapak&#39;s frame.</em>
&quot;... Oh well...&quot;

&quot;I will stay too. Help: Search, Comfort, and Remember.&quot;

Kapak swiftly descended upon Isa’s thrashing body, grabbing her arms and pinning them to her sides. He needed to keep her from injuring herself while she convulsed.
“Strider! Come here and help me keep her head still! Can’t let her hurt herself!” In the meantime, Kapak tried to listen for a heartbeat through the contact of his hands on her forearms.

<em>His helm slowly swivelled to peer at Isa&#39;s twitching form,</em>
&quot;Curious...&quot;
<em>The Strider muttered as he watched the bustle of infested creatures rush around her like so many hens. Flies, more like, around a corpse he took easy strides towards. 
He moved to stand behind her head wherein he knelt, and brought her head into his lap; his skeletal and charred fingers cupping her temples. His sunny lights that pocked his Frame&#39;s surface flickered out, and milk hued phantom image of those arms began to raise out from the scarred  limbs. Though these were evermore pristine, yet somehow, more grotesque in their pallid hue and ghostly air.

A chitinous armor seemed to break past the skin, leaving it taught and peeled around where the bonelike designs had burst through and made to cover the pale meat and skin. The only saving grace was the mesmerizing nature of the delicate and long fingers that now pressed themselves onto the collar of Isa; a faint haze, like mist trailed behind it in the ghosting image of the apparated arms.

Ripples of vibrant red energy flickered out from the long fingers and soaked into the ragged wounds of the void-warped Tenno; the Vazarin energies sinking in and causing the flesh to bubble and boil, like pink soda. Yet, the meat slowly built upwards, and made to mend the wounds instead of sinking deeper...</em></span>

Two hands appeared from Kapak’s chest in a flash and swirl of energy, both clad in gauntlets made of calcified flesh. Obviously whoever the hands belonged to didn’t want to fully come out into the open.
“My Void, she’s got a lot of energy pent up in there....!” Kapak’s voice came out, although his Warframe’s mouth did not move. Green cones of energy shot out of the hands, generating small fields of energy along her arms in a attempt to protect the Nidus’ own arms from Isa’s flames.</span>

The misting haze surrounding the ghostly limbs now crackled and popped with interference, intensifing until it seemed like to vanish entirely, before it suddenly became manifest again, and caught the mask whilst it was undone.

Void Energy dripped from growing cracks in the Strider&#39;s phantom limbs, the dusklight hued energy dripped across the leylines of his blood veins and arteries.
The energy floated away, once it hit the pebbly beach, like dust in the wind.

The Strider&#39;s form weathered whatever savagery exploded out from the Madurai Tenno; carving yet more wounds across the Warframe, revealing a morbid mockery of anatomy beneath.

Yet still, the pale arms struggled to soothe the strained Isa. With a vehement focus, The Strider&#39;s ghastly fingers slowly extended t&#39;ill they pressed into the temples of Isa. And, not unlike roots of a weed, the fingers split and began to sink into the skin of Isa; finding and burrowing into where the various pathways of blood might flow.

Her Oro had remained shut to Lekalis, locking him out, seemingly unable to form a connection with his own. It felt both damaged and defected. The explosion from the tower had taken its toll, but it seemed as though it was never &#39;right&#39; to begin with. Her eyelids opened to see the Nidus over her. Upon seeing some infested being, she did not hesitate, raising her left hand, still bearing the scars of the void. She let loose a ball of fire aimed at the Nidus&#39;s chest. Should it hit him, it would explode, catching the Loki in the resulting blast of both normal and void fire.

<em>The limbs hardened, manifesting themselves in what looked to be something close to tangible as the mist was all but vaporized as the musculature upon the forearms tensed, the chitin digging deeper at the disturbance but no doubt protecting whatever meat now manifested itself.

However, the Loki-Prime suffered vicious burns; the void-fire streaking across its armor, scoring several new deep gouges that bared a gunmetal meat and brass bone structure beneath. The previously cut and scarred left facing of the Strider&#39;s helm now was all but bare of its protective casing, leaving a grim, skull like visage peaking out from the metal flesh.

That is none to say the damage suffered by the Grineer prosthetics; his arm most immediately showed damage, as it hung loosely from its socket, boiling blood still clung to the struts that had secured its position inside the Strider&#39;s Torso. The Harkonar breastplate there had all but ruptured, the fan incapable of dispersing the heat, much less weathering the storm, now lay open and bare with a veritable clockwork of systems turning in broken loops within.

The Gill-like vents had imploded too in light of the firey backlash, and had made long craters along what could have been ribs along the Strider&#39;s sides.</em>

<em>The Loki Prime looked to be in severe need of repairs.

Yet the phantom limbs still remained, and the flickers of a face and torso remained in place where the Loki-Prime had been blasted back a few inches.
Specific features were yet difficult to make out, but there was a frightful phantom image of horns and a face not unlike the face of a Loki. If anything, what now flickered infront of the Loki Prime&#39;s torso looked to be a milky mirage of the battered frame&#39;s prime. Far before the Frame&#39;s state of disrepair.

With a gentle sigh, a breath long held, a pulse of Void energy opened up around The Strider in a rough meter around him. Enveloping himself and Isa in a Void Shield, hoping to smother the flames in a surplus of Void energy.</em>

A pink fleshy hand appeared at the edge of the rocky shore, followed by the rest of Kapak’s Warframe’s grotesque body. His aberrantly mutated and twisted body was now amplified in terms of appearance: his entire front half was seared, patches of black, crispy burnt skin hanging from the pectoral region; swathes of flesh that been swirled into strange patterns by the Void glowed with a dim, yellow light, and steam still rising from basically everywhere.
The Nidus’ partial face didn’t display anger or vengeance, but rather shock and relief mixed together (albeit with a little bit of fear) into a single facial expression: his jaw dropped and hung open.
“I-Isa...? You’re alive...? Your body was dead! You had no pulse, lethal void scarring, multiple lacerations, and I believe a set of broken ribs...” Kapak wrung his hands.
“Of course, that’s all superficial, though... your <em>Oro</em>, I could not sense it. You were as dead as the rest of them.” Kapak stepped forward, slowly and cautiously, as if afraid another wave of hell’s wrath would pour forth from Isa’s hands.
“But your power, it’s definitely not weak. Last time I got burned by a Tenno was when Vuko had to cauterize-“ Kapak’s voice broke for a moment, and began coughing.
“Excuse me, something in my throat.” He waved away an invisible cloud and gestured to Isa.
“Are you going to need me to fix you up? Both your uh, face, and internals. Or will you be doing something with your robotics like you usually do?”

As Kapak queried her, two of Kapak’s Engineers scurried over to Isa, one holding a small glass jug of water, the other holding a small first aid box. The Engineer with the water jug burbled at the other, before slapping the kit out of the other’s arms and pointing at Kapak.</span>

<em>The last fleeting words faded as the phantom limbs of The Strider pulled back into its corpus, curling into itself as if to lay into a Casket.

A flickering sunny spark crackled over his frame as his hands pulled away quietly and stiffly, before he rested his hands in his lap and fell still.</em>

The Strider&#39;s Mantis&#39; engines suddenly kicked on once again, a spat of smoke spilled out from a thin crack along its hull, as the ramp cackled and began to rise, rescinding back into its natural state; it prepared to rise.</span>

“They’ll just be a moment. I’ll give you a nice skin graft and you’ll be right as rain.

The Octavia’s head turned lethargically towards the shouting Nidus. Snapping to his senses, he quickly pushed off the rubble and rolled onto the ground. He landed with a <em>thud</em> and coughed profusely. He attempted to cry out but his speech came out all breathless and broken up.
Cev eventually managed to squeeze some words out. “Good to know I’m not the only one who made it out.”
He forced himself to his feet and walked over to Isa and Kapak. When he reached them, he exited his frame and fell to the ground.
“I barely got out of there without getting my eyebrows singed off.”
Cev chuckled which quickly turned into a hacking cough.</span>

&quot;How wonderful. I assume you worked using your true body, or were they put under before they got the chance to see you?&quot;
<em>She looked towards Cev as he appeared in front of his Warframe.</em>
&quot;That must have been a very close call.&quot;
<em>If it weren&#39;t for her damaged voice synthesizer, the remark would have been obviously dripping with enough sarcasm that it could melt a Grineer helmet within seconds. However, the damage to her voice masked it too effectively for it to be noticeable.</em>

As his cough calmed down, Cev took a moment to catch his breath.
“Yeah I got way too lucky mate.” he muttered in a somber, more serious tone as his face fell. After a moment of stillness, he turned his gaze to Kapak to respond to his question.
“Yeah It hurts a little when I breathe mate just glad that’s all that&#39;s wrong.”
Cev sat up slowly, resting his arms on his knees and quickly and rhythmically tapped his left foot against the ground. He hadn’t been able to listen to his music since the crash landing, so his pseudo-withdrawal symptoms began to kick in.</span>

This Nidus cleared his throat as his smile faltered for a moment. He walked over to Cev and gestured with his hands for him to open his mouth.
“It was a pleasure cruiser,” Kapak said to answer Isa’s question while he looked at Cev. “Anyone who had the money was welcome aboard it. Including Tenno. And of course, being the greedy money-whores that they are, you can bribe your way into any situation. Including allowing them to bring your Warframe with you.” He glances up to observer the waters again to make sure no other bodies had surfaced.
“I got the actual job mostly because one of the executives on the cruiser had heard of my skills. They thought I would bring in loads of revenue- and that I did. Corpus noblepeople enjoy modifying their bodies in more ways that one. Who am I to judge though? It paid real good. Real, real good,” he said with a devious smirk.</span>

~Sounds of struggle in the background are faint but noticeable; beams, bullets, and explosions are clearly the leads of the chaotic melody, while some grunting and shouting, foul language in guttural languages, threats and one or two girly giggles here and there harmonize along. Of all the participants three voices sound nearly identical, except for the intonation and the accent.~

I honestly couldn’t make out who was going where and doing what because of all the voiddamn Grineer mucking guts up.”

~The Engineer must have heard Cev, since he grabbed the helmet of a Grineer lancer from the pile and tore it off of the body, the head alongside it. But before Cev would be able to marvel at the tiny, ape-like creature’s seemingly super strength, he would notice that there was a large shard of metal stuck through the neck of the Grineer; its head had already been severed for the most part.
The Engineer chattered and babbled excitedly as it held up the head like a trophy or crown for Cev.~</span>

“The Voiddamn Kuva Fortress!?” Kapak moaned as he walked over to Isa, the spider-like infested machine joining him.
“Muck that place, been there once and I almost died. They have some advanced mucking technology there- some kind of machine capable of sucking your Oro right outta your frame!”
His hand split apart into an aperture of insect-like legs, which were prompt to perform a tap dance on Isa’s face. With his other hand, he made a fist and thrust it into the mouth of the spider machine, presumably to harvest out the cloned flesh of Isa.
With each stroke of the insect claws on Isa’s face, a strip of epidermis was torn off. A second stroke soon followed, covering the open scar with a brand new strip of smooth, soft skin. Slowly but surely, Isa’s beat-up, scarred and discoloured face began to look normal once more.

~In the waters, a dark humanoid body surfaced. It definitely wasn’t the shape of a Grineer~</span>

Isa just shrugged in response to Kapak&#39;s complaints about Kuva fortress. She let out a very telling.
&quot;Mmh&quot;
As she did so, clearly unimpressed by it. She felt that she had dealt with worse. She would say that, though she decided it would be for the best to not speak and hold still to let the <s>quack</s> good doctor do his work on her face without her doing anything to make it more difficult for him.</span>

In a slightly alarming but also impressive display of skill, Kapak turned away from Isa to look at whatever Cev had spotted while still repairing her face with the utmost dexterity.
“Is... that’s not...” the Nidus retracted his hand from the spider and raised it to shield his eyespot from the sun and drink in the view.
“...that’s.... THAT’S A TENNO!”
Abruptly, there was a squishing noise as Kapak’s surgical arm separated from his arm socket, the hand still clasping and healing Isa’s face despite its disembodiment. Kapak sprinted towards the rocky shore, his massive gait carrying him forward multiple meters over the water before he crashed into the ocean with a mighty splash.
Kapak swam forward as his empty arm socket began to grow a new limb. He continued grunting as he approached the now obviously Tenno body. Tendrils extended from Kapak, wrapping around the Tenno and drawing him in until the Nidus was essentially carrying the unconscious figure like a backpack. He began to swim back to shore, the almost fully submerged wreckage of the Tower groaning and bubbling behind him.</span>

Isa let out an annoyed sigh at the sudden large weight attached to her face. She reached up to take hold of the arm, then simply looked on in silence as she let it continue to work on her face. She looked at the Nidus, the eyebrow on opposite side of her face from the arm raised slightly, curious as to who the new body belonged to, but not curious enough to actually ask or do anything that might disrupt the medical arm&#39;s work.</span>

The Nidus knelt down as the tentacles sprouting from his back eased the corpse onto the ground. Kapak stood up to reveal the Tenno in dark clothing- none other than the Remnant’s once mighty leader, Mataeru Lloria.
“I... he’s got no pulse. No vitals.” Kapak ran his fingers down Mataeru’s side, flipping him over to reveal a gash in his side, deep and wide enough for the others to get a view of the fallen Tenno’s pancreas.
Mataeru’s face was pale, his lips blue from blood loss. There was no way the Tenno’s body had survived the Void wave, the crash, drowning, a wound as severe as that, and haemorrhagic shock.
“It’s.... it’s over.” Kapak said as he stood back up, taking a step away from Mataeru.
“In our hubris, we exposed ourselves.” Kapak shook his head as he ran his hands over his cherry-red scalp. “And now, the Remnant dies with its leader.”
To the left, Kapak’s Engineers gurgled and chirped quietly to each other, watching the scene. Eventually, one of them dragged Mataeru’s body to the pile alongside the rest of the deceased members of the Orokin Remnant, shrouding his body.

“Well... um. I’d like to say a few words.”
The Nidus held out his hand  to his Engineers, and the nearest of them presented Kapak with a black bound book- an ancient form of literature- to him. The book’s cover bore the mark of the Red Veil.
“This is an excerpt from the Red Veil’s death ceremony scriptures,” Kapak said sheepishly. “Personally I think their whole religion is varminkwash, but there might be something of comfort in here.”

“I dedicate this death ceremony to the fallen ones whose bodies are both present or lost to us. Vuko Drakkainen, Mataeru Lloria, Sigyn, Disruptis, Muro, Kopi Tacosa, Rast, Orokino Novatosha, Calia Aloysus, Devros von Inie, Mistaya...” he glanced towards Lekalis’ motionless Warframe, then to the radio Kuve had spoken through. He thought about Ella as well, hopefully alive out there somewhere...
He cleared his throat once more as his throat had begun to swell up for a moment.
“‘I commit thy souls to the Void, beyond the guardianship of the Lidless Eye who watches and protects us from the unknown. May your essences find solace and meaning in the world beyond the realm of matter. There in the Void, May your ethereal bodies be flegellated and ravaged by the pleasures of the one who dwells within the gap. May his.... um... eternal might and uh... lust... uh... penetrate...”
Kapak slammed the book shut and tossed it over his head several meters out into the ocean.
“Oooooook. Not reading that again.”
He shuffled for a moment before speaking up once more.
“Often times when someone dies, people need time to grieve. But we do not have that time now. Despite the fact that the Remnant is destroyed, our little family we had forged has not. Kuve and her sisters... OUR sisters. They’re out there. And we can save them.”
He made a fist and raised it.
“Throwing ourselves against the Grineer once more may not be the thing that we really want to do after yesterday, but I refuse to leave behind one of our last remaining allies. We’re going to get into those clones’ giant floating uterus, and we’re gonna get Kuve out of there.”

“Lekalis is still out there though,” Kapak said grimly, “and so is Ella. We will not leave them either! We will find them, and save them!”
Kapak’s Engineers jumped up and down behind the Nidus, screeching monstrously in support.

The three Tenno charged through the gates, laying waste to legions of clones, making their way to the sisters&#39; holding cells. Reunited with hope once more, the Tenno together made their way towards the extraction point, but before they could make it, the group was intercepted by some diabolical Grineer squad equipped with reverse engineered Orokin tools, manufactured courtesy of the dastardly Captain Vor.
The Grineer-Orokin freaks used a unique and deadly beam cannon to blast the Oro right out of Kuve&#39;s body, and quickly following up with its destruction before Kapak could do anything with his Vazarin powers.
Isa and Cev together killed the elite Grineer before they could cause further harm, and they escaped unharmed- at least physically.
After a wordless operation in Kapak&#39;s Infested Orbiter, Isa&#39;s other void scars on her body were fixed, and Cev&#39;s breathing issues were sorted out. The group decided to split up, as their spirits were down; their last chance to save a member of their family disappeared. As far as they were concerned, the order of the Veiled Tenno was over- the Orokin Remnant laid to rest.
Isa departed to focus on working. Besides, that&#39;s where her mind always was.
Cev decided to go on his own once more as a mercenary to make his living and one day find his fortune.
And Kapak descended back into the criminal underworld to pursue the career he&#39;d always had even since before he joined the Remnant so long ago...~
