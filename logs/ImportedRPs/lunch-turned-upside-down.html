        from the kitchen and with each passing minute gets stronger and

        &quot;Hmmm. I wonder what that deliciousness is that I&#39;m

        about, that the source of the smell is coming from a big pot that is
        sitting on top of the stove. Boiling in it appears to be a fleshy
        balloon of some kind... or better yet a bloated stomach of a animal.
        However, sitting near the doorway is the kubrow he&rsquo;s met from this
        morning, the hunger driven madman probably missed him in his search for
        flesh. The animal lets out a powerful and deep huff, as if warning the
        Nidus not to get near to the boiling goodie. He enforces this by getting
        up and giving his rust colored fur a shake as if preparing for a throw
        down.~</span

        succulent morsel. His sensory organs jumped with excitement as they
        detected the nutritional value of the meat. It was definitely some kind
        of stomach or intestinal lining. Lots of protein in whatever it was. He
        turned to the doorway to look at the Kubrow.</span

        companion is huge and bulky, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that he is a
        slow bozo that can only ram in to people, with size comes a great gait.
        With a precise intention, he will attempt to grab on to one of
        Kapak&rsquo;s ankles with his powerful jaw but won&#39;t bite down too
        hard on the flesh, just enough to have a grapple on the Nidus. If
        successful he will apply the brakes and yank back as hard as he can to
        put as much distance as he can between the object he is supposed to be
        guarding and the flesh crazed lunatic.</span

        the companion freezes in place and looks up at the doorway with
        Kapak&rsquo;s torn leg still dangling from his mouth by the ankle.
        Standing there is a somewhat bulky Tenno, &nbsp;his short dark hair
        spiking in all directions but at the same time appearing as if he just
        got up from a nap. His eyes are a mixture of bright gold and sunny
        orange with a twinkle of cyan on his pupil making his gaze only that
        much sterner. The boy is dressed in what appears to be a improvised
        chief gear. His torso is covered in what was once a beautiful syndana
        which by now is unrecognizable, torn, and stained by dubious liquids,
        his legs are only covered till the knee in a dress kind of fashion with
        a curtain that probably hanged from a glorious Orokin pillar somewhere,
        and finally his hands are bare and holding a very furious kicking Kuaka

        new shin and foot had already formed. &quot;As for the food, well,&quot;

        &quot;Anyways, they got pretty pissed and started to hunt for me. After

        opened palm as the whole arm rests on the table by the elbow. There is a
        curious twinkle in his cyan colored pupils, but this gaze one holds
        something far heavier than just your normal every day interest,
        it&rsquo;s almost like Devros is dissecting Kapak with his gaze alone,
        studying and analysing with great attentiveness.</span

        >He pauses his relentless devouring, pointing the spoon in Devros&rsquo;
        direction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story. But I can sum it up in 2
        words: genetic modification.&rdquo; Kapak swallowed. &ldquo;This body is
        always hungry. I suppose it&rsquo;s part of the Warframe&rsquo;s
        programming. All Warframes have a bit of their own personality,
        don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;To tell you the truth I
        don&rsquo;t know that much of my own history. The further back I go in
        my mind, the fuzzier it gets. I see jumbles of pictures, then blurry
        jumbles of pictures. And then nothing.&rdquo;</span

        >Kapak shook his head and scooped up some more of the fleshy food.
        &ldquo;It is rather confusing. But I have reason to believe some Corpus
        group were the ones who messed with my body here. Look at this.&rdquo;
        Kapak raised his left arm, revealing the inward facing part of his
        bicep. Engraved in the calcified growth was an unmistakably Corpus
        designed symbol with some writing around it. It was hard to tell what
        the symbol was, as it seemed to be quite abstract in design. &ldquo;The
        Corpus writing is just a bunch of numbers and letters. Not much in terms
        of information. But this design has been added to this Warframe&rsquo;s
        genetic code, which means that if I injure this part of my arm, this
        symbol WILL grow back.&rdquo; Kapak put the spoonful of meat in his
        mouth, swallowing it without chewing. He placed the spoon on the table
        and sighed. He gripped his chin and chuckled. &ldquo;This mouth is
        always what gets people. &lsquo;A mouth on a Warframe?! The muck is
        that!?&rsquo; I did some digging and discovered that this is just the
        product of again, genetic manipulation, performed on the Prion-class
        cranial structure for the Nidus model Warframe. That model has a
        orifice-like opening similar to a jaw, but without the same
        functionality. Obviously whoever beefed up this Warframe ended up with a
        rather strange side effect.&rdquo;</span

      <span class="c0"
        >&ldquo;What else is special about me? Well, other than my body being
        more, err, messy, I can reach things for higher things!&rdquo; Kapak
        laughed as he raised his arms in the air. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just
        because I&rsquo;m taller than normal Niduses. Uh, I also heal faster,
        and I&rsquo;m more.... stretchy... than normal.&rdquo; Kapak&rsquo;s
        hands and forearms lost their usual form and became a spiral of tendrils
        sneaking upwards towards the ceiling. &ldquo;But yeah, that&rsquo;s
        about the extent of my... innate abilities, we can call them. Since
        we&rsquo;re kind of on topic about special things about ourselves, let
        me tell you about some of my skills!&rdquo; Kapak&rsquo;s arms returned
        to normal and rested on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a real good surgeon.
        Like, REALLY good. I combine elements of my Vazarin skills with my
        Warframe&rsquo;s abilities to perform expert surgery, if I do say so
        myself. I&rsquo;ve even done cosmetic surgery a few times for some real
        vain Corpus women.</span

      <span class="c0"
        >Ah, also, one of the main things people find peculiar about me is my
        &lsquo;dolittle&rsquo; skill, as they call it. In short, I can
        communicate with Infested. There&rsquo;s a lot of biology involved with
        pheromones and brain waves, so I won&rsquo;t bore you with details. And
        no, before you ask, I can&rsquo;t just command any Infested I see to do
        my bidding. Can you imagine how overpowered that would be? I&rsquo;d get
        kicked out of the clan. Think of it this way: just because you can speak
        the same language as your enemy, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re
        friends with them.&rdquo; Kapak grasped the spoon once more and cracked
        his knuckles. &ldquo;Well, anyways, that&rsquo;s enough about me. Tell
        me some stuff about yourself! Unless you have questions, of course. But
        I&rsquo;m rather interested in your background, besides your legendary
        chef skills!&rdquo; Kapak stabbed the spoon into what remained of the
        dish.</span

        start dotting down what the other was speaking cause this all seemed
        very interesting to the son of a former biologist. Sure, his father
        worked mostly on animal DNA sequencing but Devros found a similar
        passion for the infested and while most of his attempt ended up with
        hoards of them snapping at his heel, he found this specimen that is
        sitting in front of him&hellip;and boy does he have the stupidest smile
        right now as he listened to Kapak explain and showcase the special
        abilities of his Nidus warframe. As the warframe lifts his arm to show
        Corpus numerals, Devros leaned in and fixed his glasses to get a better
        look at the text. He knows a bit of the Corpus language thanks to his
        grandfather but these ones make no sense &ndash; just a bunch of random
        words and numbers with no obvious correlation. The symbol however
        interested him greatly and he made a mental image of it just in case he
        comes across something similar during his adventures.</span

        he imagined this monstrosity drenched in blood and just wreaking havoc
        through enemy lines, and then five minutes later just doing a whole 180
        and saying to a fellow Tenno &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fix up that
        booboo&rdquo; with a smile. I guess when the time comes he will get the

        energy. &nbsp;But oh boy&hellip;where to start? Devros has so many
        questions to ask that he just sat in silence for a moment after Kapak
        stopped speaking. What do they say? Where does the food you eat go? Do
        you produce waste? Does the body eat only meat or does it consume
        anything with nutrient? What happens if your head gets chopped off? What
        about your Operator? What if you don&rsquo;t consume? Can I take a look
        inside your mouth? Can you reason with the infested? Can you drench me
        in these pheromones? Do you bleed? Can you eat a table? Don&rsquo;t you
        remember the Zariman?</span

        captured me. But instead of turning me in for a lifetime supply of
        platinum, she makes me agree to help find her twin siblings. A peculiar
        request, which I thought was a fool&#39;s errand. They were either
        killed long ago or recently, but either way I didn&#39;t think
        they&#39;d be alive. Next thing you know I&#39;m hosting a family
        reunion for her and her sisters. Crazy.&quot;</span

        >Kapak licked the fingers on his hand and rested it casually in his lap.
        &quot;My point of course, is that you shouldn&#39;t give up. Usually I
        can be pretty pessimistic, but I&#39;ve never been proven so wrong in my
        life. So, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a pretty good chance that your brother
        could still be alive. In fact,&quot; Kapak raised his hand and revealed
        a toothy looking, leech-like tube that wriggled around slightly. The
        tube-like appendage extended from his wrist, pulsatings and glistening
        with moisture. &quot;I know it doesn&#39;t looks pretty, but I can take
        a small sample of your somatic cell DNA, and upload it to Hel- to my
        cephalon&#39;s databanks. From there, I can use it to see if any other
        Tenno I find have a close enough matching DNA to be your brother. I run
        into a lot of Tenno, so you never know. Uh, what was his
        name?&quot;</span

        >Devros nodded along as Kapak went on to talk about how there is no
        better place to live than in the present. The boy agrees with how you
        shouldn&rsquo;t let your past define and drive you, but sometimes
        it&rsquo;s hard to let go of the memories, of the people you used to
        know, of the normality that was robbed by greed. Devros is no stranger
        to the rage and grief that flood him whenever he sinks too deep in to
        his memories, he once trashed his orbiter in madness when he hit a wall
        in his search but luckily he had a call back trigger that never fails to
        pull him back from these thoughts, so maybe not remembering of what you
        once had is a blessing in it&rsquo;s own way. The heavy head on his lap
        let out another puff of ease and the boy smiled, slowing down the pets
        to just how the kubrow liked them. The mention of a pink haired Tenno
        made Devros lift his head back at Kapak with a curious glint in his
        twirling eyes. He&rsquo;s only been here for a day but he sure will keep
        a eye out for someone with pink hair then. A chirping chuckle escaped
        from his dry lips as Kapak ended the story</span

        then looks back at Kapak as he explained it&rsquo;s purpose. With a wide

        unusual occurrence, it was small enough to be unnoticed in the grand
        scope of the universe. This irregularity came in the form of an
        irregularly cut apple slice, which at one moment was not anywhere and at
        the next, rested upon the nearby table. Its juices slowly dripped down
        onto the tabletop as soon as it arrived.~</span

        The fruit was, in fact, a regular apple. An apple, that he had now
        snuffed out of this world to merely become nutrients for a few cells. A
        few cells, that would eventually end up dying off as well. And so the
        cycle of the universe retains itself as dust becomes dust and the

        robe flashed a warmer yellow closer to dandelion. He was preoccupied

        of a nearby chair and pulled it towards him. Setting his device on the
        ground near his feet, he took a seat and pulled out what looked like a
        sheet of glass and a pen from somewhere inside his coat. As the pen was
        moved across the pristine transparency, a stream of light stretched
        across the surface in its wake. Disruptis wrote the words
        &ldquo;SED-134-D-1 Defros&rdquo; and &ldquo;SED-134-D-2 Kapak&rdquo; as

        caused by the fact that the other pronounced his name wrong, but from
        the eagerness of the Limbo to interview them both. Did he miss
        something? Mataeru said nothing of interviews&hellip;or is this a
        personal thing? He heard there are about 20 other Tenno here so he knows
        that he will walk in to colorful folks like the two he&rsquo;s met so
        far. Still, is this guy of some authority to just walk up and start
        asking questions? Either way, Devros doesn&rsquo;t mind really, everyone

        grinned at the Nidus&rsquo; remark</span

        >He gave his leg a bit of a wiggle to find out that the sore, pulling
        feeling is somewhat subdued. He reaches to his left sleeve and rips off
        a piece of his garment to wrap it around his wound. Nodding his head at
        his wonky patch, he taps his kubrows hip and Garhul crouches down. The
        messy haired Tenno hops on top of his companion to sit in a rider pose
        and Garhul gets up.</span

        >&ldquo;Hehe, come on man, I always have the best timing,&rdquo;
        Disruptis weakly extending his arm to deliver a soft punch to the Nidus
        out of habit. His fist stopped midway as the Limbo was suddenly overcome
        by a strange sense of deja-vu. Curious, as it was the first time it had
        happened. The feeling had a very pleasant and nostalgic taste, which
        made the Tenno a little sad for some reason. He couldn&rsquo;t quite
        remember why. When Kapak inquired Disruptis for his assistance, he
        straightened up very quickly. &ldquo;Oh good! I&rsquo;ve been meaning to
        see the inside of your strangely functional hunk of metal for
        kila-cycles! Lemme just get changed, I&rsquo;ll meet you in the
        hangar.&rdquo;</span
