Three operable grineer subs dived into the pitch-black waters in a tight formation. The experience felt similar to cruising through the void of space. Sparse cultures of fluorescent algae and plant life defiantly clung to the trench walls despite the heavy environment. 

After half an hour, the subs finally glimpsed a distant ocean floor rising to meet them. The trench flattened out at the bottom, lit by its own moss cultures. In the distance rested the shadows of three orb structures. Thousands of darkened figures glid through the water, swarming them.~

I&#39;ll take the furthest one away from us. Isa and Chegar split up left and right between you. Muro and Dominus? Keep them safe. Let&#39;s do this.&quot;

The Limbo grabbed the speed lever and punched it forwards. His craft carved through the water at max speed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With Isa&#39;s sub, the modified Archwing floated just above, gripping onto a small jutting piece of metal from the craft to aid with navigation and maintain speed with the submarines.

&quot;Dominus here. All outputs look nominal on my end, this thing is working like a charm so far. We&#39;ll see how it operates in combat, but it feels good.&quot;

In truth, he despised the ocean, at least when it came to swimming in it. Some sort of latent fear of the deep sea that he couldn&#39;t explain. But Max could endure it for the sake of the mission. After all, it wasn&#39;t much different from deep space. You were just as dead, stranded down here.

Small comforts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Good. Be be careful. It will try to self-seal any breaches in the armor but at this depth it may not be fast enough.&quot;

She adjusted the weapons of the sub a bit, double checking to make sure they were working properly. Behind her sub, connected by a cable was a fourth, semi-funcional sub. It had no life support, but enough propulsion to move under its own power, and was filled to the brim with stable explosives. It shouldn&#39;t detonate by simply being shot at, but the utility of having a massive bomb could never be underestimated.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A forward line of battalysts pulled into sight, flanked by a few Gyrix ships. The sentient fighter ships looked smaller and more disposable from a railjack, but now their size held significant presence in the tides of enemies.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis flipped his armaments on. Bubbles churned out of the grattler attached to his vessel as it spooled up. He pressed in his triggers, tearing into the formation in front of him with controlled explosions. Bits of sentient broke off and quickly sunk to the ocean floor. He cracked a grin as an old memory resurfaced in his mind.

<em>Can&#39;t shift while you&#39;re submerged, can you? That&#39;s why we kicked you down here.</em>

Soon enough the wave crashed into them. Disruptis braced himself as battalysts battered his hull in a whirlwind of strikes, shaking his sub. 

&quot;Muck!&quot; he cursed, slamming the steering wheel downwards to shake a couple of them off with a sudden ascent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A string of old earth expletives erupted from Chegar’s mouth as the sentients slammed onto his vehicle. He quickly focused his weapons on the center of his path, working to gun down anything that stood between him and the power station.
“Void turbulence has NOTHING on this!!” He blurted out, watching as a group of sentients bounced off the view port.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="16-May-22 05:40 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sensing that the submarines would be focused on most of all, the Excalibur released his hold on the fin and leveled the Latron rifle, firing rounds aimed for the Gyrix vessels as instinct, powered by a surely ancient memory, flickered. Sure enough to his memory, the battalysts lunged to get in the way of his rounds, trying to prevent him from triggering a collective explosion from the ships, but the Latron&#39;s piercing bullets had the lucky effect of taking multiple Sentients to slow down.

Lines of battalysts slowly sunk into the depths as he fired, and as the section of the mass inevitably thinned, a couple shots snuck through, punching furrows in one of the Gyrix craft. As he reloaded, the lines reformed, but the damage was done.

&quot;We wipe out the fighters, and the battalysts won&#39;t have the firepower to do much to your sub! I&#39;ll buy you time, Isa! Just break down that structure!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa&#39;s hands twitched slightly at the controls, testing the aim for a moment as the sentient host approached her, testing it one more time before they reached the ayunga&#39;s range. A few grenades were let loose into the battalysts to thin them out as she waited for the fighters to get into range. She pressed on without Dominus hanging on, her fire shifting to the Gyrix vessels once they were in range. She kept her aim steady, despite the battalysts beating on the submersible. Thankfully, even if the smaller opponents blocked for the Gyrix, they would be blown to smithereens as the water transferred the energy of the explosives far better than air.

All the while her comms were eerily silent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis yanked the controls to the right and flipped one of his turbines off, causing his vehicle to spin around like a top. He unleashed grappler rounds everywhere around him, which collided with the missiles and blew up to interrupt even more of them. He took down most of the initial barrage, but a few slipped by.

<em>BOOM!</em>

The Limbo&#39;s entire vessel shuddered. Emergency lights flashed laser red waves of illumination across the ship as digital alarms protested the current state of things. Disruptis slammed a button to kill the noise. He took two seconds to assess the situation and come to a single decision.

&quot;Muro, Dominus! They&#39;re packing way more heat than we thought. Focus on keeping Isa and Chegar safe, I&#39;ve got an idea…&quot;

A devious grin broke across his face.

&quot;...and it might just be crazy enough to work.&quot;

Disruptis plugged autopilot coordinates into his console and engaged the steering lock. He took his hands off the controls and backed away, stumbling a little as the ship rocked once again. He placed his hands on the bottom of his ship and drew a deep breath. He had to get into the right mindset for this. He had to remember the Proteus Gamble.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-977076875052609596 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=977076875052609596><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-May-22 01:14 AM">01:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>………………..

The wind screamed through the air, yanking every piece of sword steel clothing Disruptis&#39;s Limbo Prime warframe had. Above him, dark clouds of plasma swirled through Neptune&#39;s atmosphere. Below his feet rested a liset that was battered and beaten into a sorry state. It would fly however, and that&#39;s all they needed.

The scene around him was pure carnage. A dozen or more Tenno scattered about ripped sentients apart as they rained from the sky in a never ending crusade of destruction. Behind him stood three Tenno at the ready: a Trinity, an Oberon, and an old Slayer warframe model. The Slayer model was the predecessor to Chroma. 

&quot;This is risky. If you crash up there your Oro could easily be snatched up by the nearest sentient warship. You&#39;ll be gone, almost everyone agrees! Are you out of your mind?!&quot; The Trinity protested.

Disruptis forced open the liset&#39;s landing ramp with resolution. &quot;Listen, Kelle Yi, was it? Great job out there being our medic by the way. I wish we could&#39;ve done missions together before this. Regardless of what anyone else thinks, the sentients have us trapped here and are going to destroy us eventually. We&#39;re cut off from Command and out of options. The higher ups don&#39;t care enough about us to rescue us in time, but if I get off-planet I can use what little authority I have to get us backup. I&#39;m not gonna put anyone else through what I&#39;m about to do in the hopes a miracle can happen without me, unless you <em>want</em> to come too?&quot;

Kelle Yi faltered. Disruptis climbed inside the ship and revved its engines to life.

&quot;Besides, I don&#39;t like running away from my problems. I&#39;m going to dive straight into them, and this plan is just crazy enough that it might work,&quot; he finished. The Slayer stepped forward and the two shared an invisible look.

&quot;Build something for me if I don&#39;t make it, Jado. You and I made the best voiddamn team I could&#39;ve asked for.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-977077134143148092 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=977077134143148092><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-May-22 01:15 AM">01:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jado nodded. “I still think this is a terrible idea, but you’ve convinced me that I can’t convince you. Although, you’re probably the only person I believe could even pull off a stunt like this. You’ll make it back, Disruptis. I won’t have to build anything. Plus, don’t think you’re getting off that easy- you still owe me after losing that bet from Skyresh!”

Despite the looming doom that awaited him, Disrupits couldn&#39;t help but grin. &quot;My luck may be terrible all the time, but that&#39;s only so I can win gambles like this. Give em Void, Jado.&quot;

Disruptis remembered flying into the clouds of energy. The rocking of the ship. The cracking of its glass and denting of its hull. With reckless determination he reached out…

~Muro and Dominus caught sight of Disruptis&#39;s sub through the convulsing mass of battalysts that assaulted it right as a large whooshing sound reverberated through the water. In an instant, the entire submarine was covered in swirling purple light. The battalysts battered the viewport in confusion as all their attacks were harmlessly repelled. More and more swarmed around it like moths driven to a flame, drawing a helpful amount of forces away from the rest.

The group&#39;s attacks heavily damaged two of the Gyrix firing on them. They split apart into four smaller versions of their craft and continued to fire with another untouched Gyrix in the back. The final two Gyrix still chased after Disruptis.

Chegar and Isa&#39;s crafts sputtered as they approached the docking bays of their respective power stations. They both hung open, beaten and battered from some sort of previous struggle. They opened on the underside, much like typical sealab&#39;s undersea docking zones.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-977077189587652608 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=977077189587652608><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-May-22 01:15 AM">01:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Chegar&#39;s sub breached the airlock to find a line of battalysts all charging tau orbs in his direction from the walkways.

Rather than risk the reload, the Excalibur alternated to the Imperator Vandal the Archwing had stored, and began blanketing the endless battalysts and Gyrix ships with minigun fire. As he did so, he kept a close eye on Isa&#39;s sub.

&quot;What&#39;s it like in there? Are you going to be able to get to the objective?&quot;

Suddenly, his balance lurched, and Max felt one of the errant battalysts latch itself onto his leg, having slipped through the chaos. Without skipping a beat, the Excalibur took one hand off of the minigun and summoned the Exalted Blade to slice the offending Sentient in half. The sight of the purple Void-sword caused the cloud of Sentients still ahead of him to lurch back imperceptibly, but the sword disappeared quickly in favor of a renewed barrage of Imperator fire.

Save the blade for emergencies. That&#39;s the best way to use an ace in the hole.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa double checked the surrounding water pressure before responding to Dominus.
&quot;Unknown. The airlock is flooded. I don&#39;t know how well the rest of the structure has held up.&quot;
She looked to the controls of the tethered sub behind her loaded with explosives. Tempting, but she would rather not resort to those immediately. She grabbed her weapons and scanner and opened up the sub, entering the water and proceeding to where she needed to go, keeping her scanner out to monitor the surrounding pressure and ensure she wouldn&#39;t be walking into a section fully open to the crushing ocean.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Always a firing squad.” Chegar muttered to himself. He peered at the savaged console, weighing his options in anticipation of the coming bombardment. With its edges pulsing with desperate intent, his parazon latched into the interface, forcing the weapons systems to fire in large, repeating broad sweeps. Chegar set the motion to repeat until directed to stop, and removed the blade from the console. With the weapons now firing wildly, Chegar made for the subs hatch; he may have to jump for the dock, but it would be worth it to keep the sentients flailing.
With that, he dashed from the sub, nikana in hand.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="09-Jul-22 04:43 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Plenty of blackened pot marks and a few dents ravaged its hull. Only the nearest battalysts turned to address Chegar, phasing out of physicality in order to charge beams aimed at him. Beyond the line of sentients, two tunnels flanked the outside of the dome. One held lines of sentients spilling out of it, while the other was barricaded by Symbilists jamming their shields into the entranceway.

Isa swam through the fully submerged tunnel leading further into the station. The blueprints Disruptis extracted showed that this station only had one entrance from the loading bay to the central unit, unlike the other ones. Despite the raging battlefield outside, the area seemed vacant of enemy forces. It looked like the divide and conquer strategy was bearing fruit. 

She passed a few rooms until she came to a door at the end of the tunnel that led deeper into the facility. Peering through some of the frosted glass, Isa saw that the hall beyond lacked its ceiling. It had been torn into from the outside, and now the incredible weight of the ocean bore down on it. The doors themselves were emergency sealed due to the breach. She needed to find a way to get to the other side.

The swarm of sentients took Muro&#39;s bait and peeled off to face him. A forward troupe of conculysts rushed in, dragging whirlpools through the water while a line of battalysts took aim from behind. A Gyrix lurked in the distance, pulling into position for the right opportunity.

The Gyrix splinters screamed past Dominus, unleashing a flurry of missiles his way. From the front, five Symbilists advanced on the Excalibur in a shield formation, charging attacks behind their defense.~</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Chegar made for the Symbilists, dropping Tesla Nervos along his path for any wayward Sentient that tried to contest him. He flung a bastille towards the opposite tunnel, hoping to delay the tied of enemy combatants entering the dome. With one final bullet-jump, Chegar flung himself across the room to the Symbilists. Focusing in on his target, He plunged the blade of his Nikana between the Sentient&#39;s shield and the passages wall, and threw his &#39;frame and Nikana&#39;s hilt against the opposing wall, hoping to pry enough room to get a clear shot. With his Vauban making impact with the wall, Chegar emerged; Amp crackling with void as he jammed it into the gap, and delivered a concentrated burst of void energy into the Symbilist&#39;s Side. With any luck, that would cripple the sentient enough to push it the rest of the way out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Muro almost smirked behind his helmet. These bots seemed confident. The confidence of numbers.

She contacted Dominus over comms.

The missile swarm was nothing new, and Dominus took advantage yet again of the Imperator&#39;s firepower to blast the projectiles before they got too close, setting off a cloud of chained explosions as he briefly overclocked the throttle of the archwing to push himself through the opening. He collided with one of the Symbilists in the shieldwall, plunging the Pangolin Sword into the Sentient&#39;s chassis before wrenching it around and pointing its charged laser at its fellows. As he did, Isa&#39;s communications slipped through, thanks to her slightly better pressures not affecting the signal as much.

Comm static came from the Disruptis&#39;s direction as well, finding similar success. The Limbo had pulled his craft into his station by now, but his current state was unknown.

The sentient reinforcements engaged their phasing forms as Chegar&#39;s bastille flew through the air, but the effort was fruitless. The bastille&#39;s shimmering dome completely barricaded the tunnel from being exited, buying him a lot of time. One battalyst managed to sear Chegar&#39;s back with a beam before all of them convulsed under the high intensity tesla shocks. The vauban pushed through the Symbilists into a tunnel marred by scratch and burn marks. It continued a couple dozen meters forward before the rest of it was blocked with cargo boxes. Someone didn&#39;t seem to want anyone going back there. Three Symbilists injured by the Void blast turned to focus their own Tau beams on the intruder.

Muro&#39;s charges exploded, tearing the stack of sentient bodies limb from limb and scattering them across the seabed. As the Hydroid leaped backwards, he caught the glimpse of a bright green light surge to life in the dark somewhere far in front of him. Three seconds later, a massive Tau laser blazed across the waters. Muro was blinded as the left half of his warframe was caught grazing the edge of the stream. Bubbles screamed upwards, summoned by the sheer heat. It burned, bad.

When Muro&#39;s eyes adjusted back to the darkness, he glimpsed the source of the attack. The shape of a gargantuan sentient slumped onto a rock outcropping past the stations further ahead. What looked like a towering spike pinned its chest to the stone, slightly illuminated little specks of light all across the sentient&#39;s chest.

Dominus hijacked the beam and totalled another Symbilist. A third Symbilist approached him from the back and slammed him over the head with its shield. The splintered Gyrix fired off another round.~</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="06-Jun-22 04:29 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Chegar could feel the slight slagging where the sword-steel met the ‘frames flesh, wincing at the transferred pain. Wasn’t enough time to patch it; he’d just have to wear the burns for a bit longer. He dashed towards the blockage at the end of the passage way. He spun to fire a bust of rockets from his Angstrum, redrawing his nikana, and dropping a vector pad to speed him on his way. Chegar took a moment for the tau orb volley to pass, taking care to either deflect or evade the path of the project tiles. He then turned his attention back to the cargo containers, and began trying to pull them out of the way; if a ‘frame could pull parts out of a Corpus orb-proxy bare handed, then trying to slide these out of the way would be worth a try.  And if worse came to worse, He could always try using tether coils to fling the containers out of the way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She said as she reached the sub. climbing back inside and letting it empty the water from itself before re-opening the airlock doors and pilotinging it out toward the excalibur, firing away with its grenade launcher at the wall of Symbalists. The shots were quite well-aimed, the explosions able to destroy the symbalists while merely being uncomfortably close to Dominus, even factoring for the water ability to carry shockwaves more easily than air.

The Symbilists were being more a nuisance than an actual threat, as the Excalibur was effectively flipped end over end from the ramming attempt. It <em>hurt,</em> sure, but ultimately he was about to stab at the offending Sentient when Isa&#39;s explosives tore into them, also catching up the Gyrix&#39;s fire in the process.

Immediately, the modified archwing carried him away from the pack under Isa&#39;s sustained fire, further suppressing them with more rounds from the Imperator as he angled towards the opening in the tower, moving as quickly as the crushing depths of water would allow.

His first round of attackers handily dispatched, Muro surveyed the battlefield as best he could, trying to pick out another suitable target. The massive green light that blazed to life far from him caught his attention, though he had no way of knowing what it was at a glance, nor did he have any time to guess.

&quot;AAARRGGH!&quot; Muro howled as the beam left half of his frame writhing in agony. In that seemingly infinite moment of impact, his own memories seemed to play out before him in lieu of his normal vision. Memories of his last great battle, and his abject failure that burned more harshly than this surprise attack. Muro barely managed to push himself away, half his body raw and screaming as he sank back towards the seabed. With the immediate source of pain gone, he was able to string together a coherent thought: He couldn&#39;t fight like this. Upon hitting the seafloor, the Hydroid dropped his his knees, assuming a meditative posture as his shotgun fell on the sand beside him. On the other end of the transference, the gaunt Tenno who piloted the ravaged frame breathed deeply, focusing all the energy he had into attempting to mend the frame.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dominus easily located the torn room and entered it from above. It looked like this was a part of the main hallway that led to the reactor, it had nothing special in it. When this section of the structure was compromised, the breach doors on both sides slid down to keep the water from entering the rest of the facility. He would have to find a way inside without an airlock.

Muro snuck in twenty seconds of healing before a four foot spear sunk into the sand beside him. It cackled with light green sentient energy at the tip, which then exploded in a blinding flash of colour, shocking the Hydroid and decimating all deepsea wildlife in the area. Muro watched a tall sentient approach him in the darkness, illuminated by his own green lights. He felt its voice reverberate through his body.~

Chegar found himself in a square room, about five meters on a side.  The crates and boxes used to block the doorway seemed to have originally been stacked on either side of it, and the few that hadn&#39;t fit in the doorway had been left in their places.  In the back of the room was a deep pool of water and a pictogram of something exploding, and a sign on one of the side walls said something about safe handling of mining equipment.  That explained why the room was at the end of a long hallway - it was intended to store mining explosives, but it seemed to have been repurposed.  The crates had obviously been stacked in front of the sign, and their labels said things like <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">ogma cargo door hinge replacement</code>.

As Chegar landed, something stepped back, out of the way of his jump.  Another symbilyst, hiding behind its shield and poking its laser around the edge of it.  But the shield was battered, covered in burn marks that looked awfully similar to those usually left by Sentient weaponry.  And just visible below the shield were a warframe&#39;s feet.

&quot;Tenno or mimic?&quot; said the shield-bearer.

The Archwing floated along the shutters for a few precious seconds, Dominus running his hand along the structure to try and find some form of manual release. If he could fill the entire structure with water, it might actually be an improvement over switching between &#39;land&#39; and &#39;ocean&#39; operations with the archwing.

Finding nothing, the Excalibur quickly darted for side doors, hoping to find any form of control panel or alternate route to slip around and get to the reactor. He didn&#39;t want to risk cutting through the breach doors, not yet. The archwing could handle the intense pressures of the ocean thus far, but a sudden rush of water might be the thing that overwhelmed it. Not to mention the process of cutting through might be impossible, even with his frame&#39;s enhanced capacity for it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa picked up the movement on the sub&#39;s sensors, she quickly maneuvered the dummy sub to intercept as many of them as she could.

Then her hands went to the walls of the sub as she called forth her miasma into the water around the sub, focusing on the missiles, hoping the deconstructive nanites would be able to disable a good portion of the missiles before they reached the sub.

More than a few of them made it through, but she was able to stop enough that the hull of her sub wasn&#39;t significantly breached. A few small leaks sprung in the hull, but she would last for now. The bigger issue was that one of the screws had taken damage, severely reducing her maneuverability as she now tried to turn to face the Gyrix to unload a barrage of grenades.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Angling his head just high enough to look into what he assumed was the Sentient&#39;s eyes, he spoke.

The Gyrix posited a question: how long could she last? Her sub still floated, but it wasn&#39;t pretty. 

Isa&#39;s answer, however, returned the question back to sender. The Gyrix failed to escape the blast radius, splintering into its final four fragments which flew around. The tail of one of the splinters then caught on another explosion and sunk it, leaving three left. Without Railjack sensors, it was hard to tell which one was the anchor for all four.

A single pipe jutting out of the wall next to the door betrayed the remains of a control panel, though now there were only severed wires. There were no alternate routes and no extra doors. There was the door to the reactor, and the door to the hallway Isa was in on opposite sides of the room. Few options presented themselves, and Dominus was on the clock with sentients hot on his heels. The situation looked grim.~

<strong>Sentient Commander:</strong>
The Sentient narrowed its eyes. Without another word, it aimed its left arm at the Tenno. The arm was fashioned similar to a battalyst&#39;s cannon, but much longer with way more capacitors. The entire limb shook as a fierce green Tau orb formed within the circular chamber at the tip which spread further apart as the projectile grew to half the size of Muro&#39;s hydroid. It unleashed the Tau orb, which flew towards him at a blinding speed.

&quot;Error. You approach blind as a bat?&quot; It seemed to scoff in monotone, &quot;are you a mere puppet, dangling by Orokin strings? You face the graveyard of Ikazu: father of the Phantoms. I am Tongar, his champion. I shall enact his vengeance.

In her right hand she held the shield and in her left a Shedu, both with the torn remains of a Symbilyst&#39;s arms hanging from them.

With a click, the Veritux on the archwing detaches, unfolding into the frame&#39;s hand. Hefting the blade, he begins hacking away at the structure, pausing only for a moment after each chop to see if the water was flowing into the crevice.

The archwing most <em>likely</em> could handle the shift in pressure and sudden deluge, but Dominus would much rather that the door caved in, and the water poured through, without sending him tumbling in the process. He kept chopping, hoping to see a breaking point.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa wasted no time in taking aim and firing at each of the four fragments, one after another. Her turret had avoided taking damage for the most part, leaving it just as responsive and flexible as she had initially made it.

On the other side, a few sentient fragments arranged themselves in a defensive line. They didn&#39;t seem intent on following him in.

The Gyrix launched a final missile volley at the same time Isa pulled the trigger on her turret, before the explosions destroyed the real aircraft. A final Gyrix spawned from the ashes of the splinters, but then scattered into pieces as the series of explosions continued. Unfortunately, a few missiles slipped past Isa&#39;s defenses and struck her thrusters with a BOOM. Alarms blared, screens shuddered and filled up with red error messages as the thrusters failed to keep the sub afloat. Isa began to sink to the rocky ocean floor.

The laser edges on Dominus&#39;s blades carved through the door with resistance, but progress. Without warning, a large section of the door fell away, as if its backside had been corroded away. This opened an incredible current of shifting pressure right where Dominus was floating! The current yanked on the Excalibur&#39;s legs like a rat caught in a rope trap, hurtling him through the hole and across the rest of the long hallway that awaited him on the other side. Within an instant, the second set of breach doors clamped down to halt the incoming flood. Everything happened in a flash for Dominus. The next thing he knew, he was kneeling on the other side of the breach door, trapped inside the facility with ten centimeters of standing water and a hall that led to the large bay doors of the reactor room. The air was warmer here, but the steel floor felt cold as ice.

The Tau orb violently exploded into a torrent of electricity, which struck Muro on the side as he rolled.

Chegar let out a worried huff, glancing back at the sentients just out side before returning his attention to the Yareli.
&quot;We might have to discuss that after we get out of here.&quot; Chegar said, trying not to let his worry show through. &quot;Do you know if there&#39;s a wired or analog communication line to the other stations?

&quot;Mm...that&#39;s exactly what I was hoping <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> happen.&quot;

He was no stranger to hard landings, no Tenno was, but to do it in water, and while wearing an archwing at that, felt particularly strange. Straightening out, the Excalibur immediately took off for the bay doors, looking for yet another terminal to try and force them open so that he could enter.

Failing that, he kept the Veritux in hand, and if the door was also similarly not able to be opened from this side, he would waste no time cutting his way through. Getting to the reactor took expedience over any form of subtlety at this point.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Various figures flitted about in the water far above, but none seemed to follow her. She had a moment to rest.

Until she heard a small popping sound from the back of her sub.

At the stern of the ship, a leak sprung. Even though the hole was small, the intense pressure shot forth water like a jetstream. It quickly coated the belly of the ship in a puddle of salty seawater and kept rising.

Dominus approached a very thick door. It looked like it would take an annoying amount of time to cut through, but even though a small service hallway devoid of lighting circled the perimeter of the reactor room he knew this was the only entrance. Though just as he stepped up to it, he came face to face with a battalyst walking through the service hallway! Its neon green lights betrayed its position, and Dominus saw it instantly draw an arm up to charge a deadly laser…

…when a much larger sentient arm emerged from the darkness behind it. Its hand bore seven flat fingers that lifted the battalyst up in the air by its core.~

<strong>???:</strong>
&quot;Sleep, poisoned one,&quot; a feminine voice reverberated off the cold metal walls.

The hand closed, crushing the sentient&#39;s core. It spasmed as it died and was dropped to the floor. Dominus&#39;s eyes fixed on the cyan lights of a tall, lanky sentient commander lurking in the dark. She regarded him with piercing eyes.

&quot;Tenno,&quot; she muttered, yet made no sudden movements.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="18-Jun-22 08:31 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-987877141779714098 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=987877141779714098><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Jun-22 08:31 PM">20:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Tongar:</strong>
Tongar quickly drew his spear back after seeing it pass straight through Muro. He began to charge another Tau orb when the cascade of water slammed into him. Small cracks splintered across his limbs as the projectiles threw him backwards. The sentient commander raised his hands forward to soften the blow from the hits when his body wreathed itself in a shimmering green light. The effect of the tempest barrage gradually reduced until Tongar floated in place, hand easily deflecting the onslaught. 

&quot;Warframe ability immunity acquired. Error. Father Ikazu is now dead, but the enhancements he bestowed remain steadfast. You lack the power to destroy me. Despair now,&quot; Tongar shot back.

While on alert as the battalyst came into view, the sudden appearance of the Sentient hand and its crushing of the drone caused him to settle back into a relaxed, albeit cautious, stance, observing the large commander. It wasn&#39;t attacking him outright, so there was no reason to go on the offensive just yet.

&quot;Sentient. I have important business with the reactor inside this tower, and I would see it done.&quot;

There wasn&#39;t much time to fight, and even less to negotiate. But if he was dealing with the rare case of a Sentient that might actually cooperate, if only by inaction, Dominus wouldn&#39;t object to it.

<strong>Sentient Commander 2:</strong>
The eye slits on the sentient commander bowed downwards, as if wearing a tired or perhaps even mournful expression.

&quot;That… you do not get to know,&quot; she interjected in an oddly soothing voice. She reached a massive hand above Dominus&#39;s head and slammed its digits into a console on the side of the door. It sparked and cackled as her metal fingers dug in. After a second, the bunker door to the reactor cranked open. A blast of cold fog rolled across the Excalibur from inside. The center of the darkened chamber beyond was dominated by a grineer reactor the likes of which Dominus had seen many times. Amidst the whirlpool of new technology on display in the last number of hours, this felt almost nostalgic.

&quot;Go,&quot; the sentient continued, lowering her head, &quot;do what you came here to do, void demon.&quot; 

<strong>Tongar:</strong>
Tongar&#39;s neck spasmed for a split second, a motion Muro just about barely noticed. He charged another tau orb but this time held it at bay, pointed in his direction. Tongar himself seemd to find the situation as troublesome as Muro did.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Excalibur wasted no time, darting ahead as the air became cold, hefting the Imperator as it revved. As the bulky archwing and frame slid to a stop, he lifted the large minigun just across from the generator.

&quot;No time for subtlety, and I can&#39;t risk any of the Sentients turning this back on afterwards! If you&#39;re able to, I recommend leaving now before this whole structure crumples in on itself!&quot;

This was a stupid idea. He <em>knew</em> this was a stupid idea. He should&#39;ve suggested they bring fuel cores or some other charges to sabotage the generators more directly, and more importantly, from considerable distance. But there wasn&#39;t time, and this would at the very least ensure the stoppage of one power line feeding into the system. It would buy them a little extra time.

With that thought in mind, Dominus depressed the trigger of the Imperator, and the bullets began to fly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They held their ground.~

<strong>Sentient Commander 2:</strong>
The Sentient Commander slinked into the hallway behind Dominus and slumped onto the floor. It almost curled into a ball as it sat watching the Tenno execute his mission, as if in some strange form of acceptance. Its lights flickered off one by one.

~Dominus&#39;s gunfire quickly stripped the coolant casing of the reactor&#39;s fuel rods. The rods began to melt and release gasses that quickly filled the room with hydrogen. Alarms blared and terminal screens filled up with rapidly blinking diagrams. At the end of the Imperator&#39;s clip, sparks flew out from the circuitry. 

<em><strong>KA-BOOOOOM!!!!!</strong></em>

A massive fireball erupted throughout the reactor room, decimated everything inside and out to the hallway. The entire station broke its supports and fell over sideways onto the ocean floor. Highly pressurized water clamored into the ruptures in the reactor roof and quickly extinguished everything inside with a storm of bubbles.

Floating. The Excalibur slowly had its vision unscramble itself, as diagnostics gave Max a brief status update. His shields were, rather predictably, recalibrating themselves, leaving the archwing&#39;s modified structure to support him against the fast-accumulating pressure as water flooded into the wreckage.

Casting his view around, Dominus was rather shocked to even be alive in the first place. He&#39;d been worried that he, and his &quot;ride&quot; wouldn&#39;t have been able to take the explosion at all. Considering they couldn&#39;t communicate with their Orbiters, he&#39;d been equally worried what that would mean for their Transference.

But, there he was. Floating in a now sideways tower. As the telltale sound of his shields regenerating (albeit still quite slow) came across, the Excalibur gingerly began to look for an exit from the wreckage, hopeful that the others had managed some progress in the time he was out. Assuming it was a long time in the first place.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Tongar spun around a second too late. He barely unleashed his held Tau orb in Muro&#39;s direction as the grenades crashed into him, enveloping the commander in a cloud of bubbles and smoke.

As he emerged from the wreckage, Dominus watched the Sentients frenzy to reinforce their remaining towers, before slowly letting the archwing propel him forward, looking for Isa&#39;s submarine. As he did so, he chanced the now slightly less hazy frequencies.

&quot;One tower down. The generators are as susceptible to simple sabotage as I expected. Isa, are you still online? Do you need assistance, or should I carry on to another objective? With the Sentients repositioning, the others are going to need support soon.&quot;

If she responded, all would be well, but if the signal was still too scrambled, or the worst had come to pass, he&#39;d simply have to operate on his own volition. Either way, the Excalibur carried on, weapons at the ready for any ambush lying in wait.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A bullet-jump between the boxes, then running forward.  A few Sentients pointed their lasers at her, leaving new burn-marks on her shield.  Sharratmuri ran directly at them, shield-first, and did not shoot back at them until she was in the middle of them.

She fired one shot.  One brief sweep of a laser-beam, no effort to aim at anything specific, because it didn&#39;t matter if it hit anything.  What mattered was that it was the last shot, emptying the Shedu&#39;s battery or bladder or whatever it was that Sentients had.

The Shedu, thus emptied, started its reload with an explosive release of pent-up energy.  Sharratmuri wasn&#39;t sure exactly what it was or why it worked, but she didn&#39;t really care.

&#39;Well, at least that looks like it hurt.&#39; Muro thought. The cracks in its form and the audio errors it was suffering were proof enough to the Tenno that he wasn&#39;t completely outgunned here.

The Shedu&#39;s energies concussed the surrounding sentients, staggering them and removing the radiation and Blast resistances they had built. Chegar and Sharratmuri bounded through the stuff corridors, carving sentients as they needed. The station swarmed with them like an irritated ant hill vomiting a river of soldiers. They duo took a lot of hits, yet pushed onwards. 

They eventually came to the entrance to the reactor room, only to find a truly bizarre sight. The bulkhead door to the room had been replaced by… a sentient? A large sentient mass spanned the width of the doorway, sealing access inside. It looked like something straight out of a Murex. Typically motion detected near it would open it, but somehow the Tenno got the feeling it would be harder this time. Hordes of sentients closed in on their location from behind, keeping the pressure high.~

<strong>Tongar:</strong>
Tongar swung around to witness the destruction of the first station. He fell into a bit of a stupor for just a moment.

&quot;Why… am I here?&quot; He uttered.

Without warning, Tongar flung the spear in front of him shaft-first.

The Vauban slid to a screeching halt, stopping just a few meters from the Large sentient door. He quickly gawked at the mass, listing off in his mind some of the ways to pry it from.

&quot;It&#39;s a Sentient,&quot; she said.  &quot;There won&#39;t be a control panel unless someone made one.&quot;

Facing away from the wall, shield held up toward the approaching Sentient drones, she stepped back, placing herself just the right distance away from the wall, and cast Aquablades.  Water condensed out of the air, circling around her, gaining speed and compressing itself flat until it became sharp.  The disc of water would cut at the Sentient wall behind her for only a moment before it adapted, but any damage it did there was just a bonus.  The main purpose was to keep the drones from getting too close.

&quot;Void it is, then.&quot;  With Aquablades to keep melee-attacking Sentients from disturbing her work, and her warframe positioned to shield her from ranged attacks with its body, Sharratmuri stepped out backwards.  She turned to face the wall, raised a hand, and...

&quot;...eugh.&quot;  Fibrous gray growth, like a tree branch stripped of bark, studded with bioluminescent blue nodules and moistened with a greenish slime, had covered her arm.  No, more than that.  Mild disgust and annoyance exchanged themselves for horror on her face as she looked down at herself and saw.  Her whole body was covered in the Infestation.  She felt her stomach do a double-take.  For a moment that felt too long, she stood staring, words failing her.  <em>My ship, my cryopod!</em>  What had happened to her ship?

She took a breath and swallowed.  Her hands, at least, were clean.  Her face, her head - she reached up and felt it, a short mohawk of curly hair - yes, that was clean.  She snapped her fingers, creating a grey-white spark.  Void-energy still flowed, as strong as ever.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said dryly.  &quot;Shit.&quot;  Infestation was a problem, but not the most pressing at the moment.  She stepped forward, pressed her hands against the living-machine wall, and began to push into it the warping, sterilizing energy of the Void.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not sure how much I&#39;ll be able to do here, but so long as you have the bomb sub, the Sentients probably don&#39;t want anything to do with you.

Sharratmuri heard a cacophony of clicking sounds as she pushed Void energy into the wall. The wall itself began to screech in protest. At the same time, it budged a little in the Tenno&#39;s hands, as if it were unlocked. It was too heavy to open with her thin arms though.

Behind them, an Aerolyst clambered into the hallway. It pushed off the ground with its wings and gave a deafening howl before launching a series of projectiles towards the two Tenno.~

<strong>Tongar:</strong>
&quot;Why… am I still alive?&quot;

The grenades decimated Tongar&#39;s waist, tearing his legs off. The sentient turned, spear returning to hand. Another burst shot forth, and what remained of his upper body zoomed along with it, brushing through the bubbly aftermath of grenade explosions. As he did, he charged a massive tau orb in his launcher. The commander reached Muro and fired it point-blank at his left leg, blowing it off at the knee.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sharratmuri&#39;s view was blocked by Chegar standing over her, but she wasn&#39;t looking.  She continued to flow Void energy into the door, hoping to corrode and weaken it further, and thus make it easier for Chegar to open.

One popped out with a powerful whirl and cracked the shield held by the disconnected Yareli. The others closed in.

Dominus snatched the welder from the airlock and got to work. Every muscle in his body tensed as the minutes ticked by, waiting for an ambush while focusing on applying the right changes. It was moments like these where the deep, suffocatingly dark waters felt most like the awe-inspiring expanse of space. Any single movement of light indicated conflict was inevitable.

As the door opened to reveal a reactor of a design unfamiliar to her, Sharratmuri hazarded a glance behind her, past Chegar.  Her warframe stood in the same positions she&#39;d left it in, holding up a shield that was now useless.  A pair of Conculysts had gotten inside the circle of Aquablades, which was pretty easy to do even without phasing.  One was taking the opportunity to do its worst to the undefended warframe, apparently unaware, or perhaps not caring, that there was no-one in it.  And the Aquablades, left active, would surely have drained nearly all of the warframe&#39;s energy by now.  But none of that was really a problem; the Unairu Way made it possible to revive a recently-downed warframe if needed.  More important was locking down the reactor, and anyway, doing that would likely render the Sentient problem moot.

She took a running stride forward, and slightly to the side to make way for Chegar, then was struck by two realizations.  The first was that, without any weapons or tools on her except her own ability to channel the Void, it would be difficult to either damage the reactor or shut it down, so what was she doing running toward it?  How helpful could she be there?  Chegar had more than enough firepower (and with his parazon, hacking ability) to do whatever he wanted to the reactor.  The second was that if the reactor shut down explosively, she would be facing a potential nuclear catastrophe at point-blank range, and she would rather do that from inside a warframe, even one that was damaged and depleted of energy.

Midway through her second running stride, in one fluid motion, she turned and threw two wads, two packets of Void energy, back toward her Warframe.  The first was a Caustic Strike.  The second was herself, using Transference.

Sharratmuri dropped the broken stump of a shield and deactivated Aquablades with just a drop of energy left, letting the swirling sharp water splash harmlessly to the floor.

The Conculysts on either side of her seemed to have the advantage, despite being without armor.  They were adapted for melee combat, and she couldn&#39;t shoot them with the Shedu at such close range - it was too large and unwieldy.  Perfect, then, for striking one of the Sentients with the large and unwieldy barrel as she turned to face the reactor room.

&quot;Shut it down, Chegar!&quot; she yelled, with a taste of triumph in her voice.  &quot;I&#39;ll hold &#39;em off for a bit!&quot;

With the door now cracked open, Chegar peered in to see the grineer&#39;s handiwork. Fuel injectors, Coolant lines, Core reactor: all possibilities flooding his mind at once with the line of Conculysts closing in. 
There wasn&#39;t much time: he quickly cataloged all the weak points he could see from his position. With his objective ahead of him, and the enemy behind him, he&#39;d need to make every shot count. He quickly wedged his Vauban&#39;s leg into the door, helping to keep it open, and the reactor exposed. That&#39;s when he heard the shield crack. He looked back to see the result of the Caustic strike, and the wisp drifting towards him.

Hearing Sharratmuri Call out, Chegar knew he was out of time. He&#39;d have to time this perfectly. He quickly drew his Angstrum, narrowing in of the coolant lines. Not even a second had passed from the missiles being launched had the Vauban when slightly limp: a flurry of green-orange void erupted from it as Chegar stepped forward and out. Taking advantage of the wisp, Chegar lobbied an volley of explosive energy towards the straggling sentient Combatants, then followed up with a seeking stream of void towards those closest to his ally. Between Sharratmurit and the encroaching sentients, a thin shell of void energy began to coalesce, and Chegar disappeared in a flash.

With the coolant now leaking, Chegar moved, pushing his ‘frame into a full sprint. Best case scenario; the leaks would force a shutdown before he did. Worse case scenario; he’d have to force the reactor into a meltdown.

And Given the unknown state of his sub, Chegar wasn’t too keen on resorting to a meltdown. Still, the option remained on the table.

“Okay; here we go.” He said hurriedly, jamming the blade of his parazon into the console once he arrived.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="07-Aug-22 06:15 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If he could breath in the Warframe, he would&#39;ve let out a sigh of relief. Tapping the side of the submarine, the Excalibur pushed off, hovering just off the side of vessel.

&quot;You&#39;re green, spool her up. I&#39;ll cover you while we head forward, your sensors are going to be a lot better than anything I can see. If we get closer to the triangulation point, we may be able to get in touch with Disruptis and the others.&quot;

Their difference in speed meant he could patrol in a wide berth around the submarine while still being able to quickly react to any Sentient threats.

Chegar watched the flickering numbers of the core temperatures displayed on the console skyrocket before his very eyes. A regular reactor would SCRAM into complete shutdown in event of a breach such as this. This, however, was a Grineer reactor. Even after years of war with Tenno sabotaging their systems, they never learned to shut them down once the coolant was removed. The good news was that the reactor wouldn&#39;t go critical for another five minutes. 

The bad news was that the reactor would go critical in five minutes. 

A hot vent burst beyond the hallway, showering the sentients outside with flames and finishing up what remained from the Tenno&#39;s assault. An explosion shook the station from somewhere below. The lights flickered momentarily and the entire floor tilted a couple degrees to the west.~</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa checked the sensors as they approached, especially now that they noticed the sentients warming around the station Disruptis had entered. She waited to open fire until she could get a read or visual on whatever priority targets there may be, particularly on the lookout for more Gyrix, as they posed the largest threat to the sub.

Chegar&#39;s shield protected her warframe from damage as the hallway was sprayed with a pipeful of something hot.  The Sentients were not so lucky.  Sharratmuri took the opportunity to retreat a step, into the torn-open doorway.

She glanced behind her at the reactor, wondering what kind of idiot had designed it without any sort of failsafe or emergency shutdown to deal with a loss-of-coolant.  (For a moment she considered that perhaps Chegar had somehow disabled it - which would make him either incompetent or untrustworthy, and the designer would <em>still</em> be an idiot for making the failsafe possible to disable - and dismissed the possiblity as quite unlikely.  Chegar so far seemed quite competent, and obviously not on a suicide mission.  Though, on the other hand, was shooting the coolant lines really such a great idea, when the control panel presumably allowed a manual shutdown...?  She decided that it probably was, since a careful shutdown would take time but a forced shutdown would immediately cut off the power to Ikazu, and time was of the essence.  Perhaps Chegar had been expecting a failsafe, as any reasonable person would, only to find that there was none.)

The tremor and the tilt of the floor shook her from her reverie of reactor-examination, and she quickly turned her gaze back to the hallway, berating herself for not keeping watch.  Such a lapse seemed odd for her, and she speculated that perhaps the long cryosleep had somewhat affected her cognition.  Or more likely, fighting to open a living door after single-handedly withstanding a day-long siege had finally started to tire her.  Tenno of Unairu were hardy, but they had their limits.  It was just lucky, she thought, that more Sentients hadn&#39;t come down the hallway and attacked her while she&#39;d been distracted.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="09-Aug-22 10:52 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1006744742098382900 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1006744742098382900><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Aug-22 10:04 PM">22:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A moment passed of staring down the empty hallway, then she heard Chegar call out from behind her.  <em>Five minutes? ...Sentients will be here by then...</em>  But she knew she could hold them off.

The slow creeping forward of the sub and archwing gave Max plenty of time to think, especially as the garbled message kept repeating. While it was scrambled in different ways each time, it held a specific pattern...

<em>...Testing. He&#39;s trying to call.</em>

But if he called, or they responded, it would mean drawing the Sentients onto them. They needed to pull a chunk of them away from the tower. Floating in close to Isa&#39;s submarine, and laying a hand on it just to make the connection stable, and prevent from giving them away, he spoke.

&quot;Disruptis is trying to ring us. If I pull the wolfpack&#39;s attention away from the tower, do you think you can get close enough to pin down his frequency? Depending on what he needs, you or I can then go in for backup. Probably me so that we can keep your bomb as a last resort, but it&#39;s ultimately your call.

The parazon flashed, more and more inputs rushing down the length of its blade. Chegar quickly worked to initiate the SCRAM.

“Yes I did!” Chegar called out, making sure the shutdown protocol actually took. “Hopefully, if ikazu’s lost enough power, we should be able to contact the other teams in the area!”
He did his final check, locking down the reactor, then withdrew his parazon.
“Okay let’s go!”
He then leveled his sobek at the console; even with their ability to subvert technology, sending a few rounds through the interface would, hopefully, keep the sentients delayed a bit longer.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="11-Aug-22 10:28 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Chegar spotted his battered sub being tossed mercilessly against the back of the dock by the churning waters. Another pipe burst in the ceiling, belching another plume of flame. A portion of the ceiling caved, spilling a raging current of high pressure ocean into the bay, showering the two Tenno. The water started to rise <em>fast</em>.

A small battalion of conculyst detached from the cloud and ran Dominus down. Their spinning churned the ocean so that it looked like whirlpools chased him down. Dominus sprayed a couple of them down, but the others engaged. He was battered from all sides by the powerful blows of their tuning fork-arms.

The Excalibur turtled up under the conculyst barrage, his and the archwing&#39;s enhanced shields holding against the onslaught for now. As Isa&#39;s sub rolled through, he almost couldn&#39;t help but laugh, before the telltale purple energies swirled into being from his frame.

With a sudden burst, Dominus let loose a Radial Blind, the Void-made light briefly piercing the crushing darkness of the ocean, and then, immediately following the disorienting shock to the system, gathered a collection of spectral blades around him, Skana constructed entirely out of Voidstuff.

As the energy blades tracked their targets, he let them loose, the Radial Javelin salvo aiming to penetrate individual conculysts, disabling them, and draw even more towards him as he began a retreat, maintaining heavy fire from the Imperator on the cloud of Sentients.

Any well-designed system, in her opinion, should have its failsafes built inseparably into it.  A reactor with a whole subsystem missing should not have even been possible to turn on.  And even still, design issues aside, no competent administrator should allow such corner-cutting to happen under their nose.  Not only had the worker screwed up, but so had their supervisor, and the operators must have been aware too that their equipment was missing a critical safety system.

There was only one possible response to such incompetence.
&quot;...jeez...&quot;

This was the tomb of a Sentient.  Every Tenno and every Orokin knew how much depended on keeping it sealed -- potentially billions of lives were at stake.  No matter who had emerged victorious from the Outer Terminus, surely they would have kept close supervision on any projects down here, and spared no expense to make sure it was done right.  Surely they would have known to get the Warden&#39;s approval first.  Just how bad <em>were</em> things going on the surface, that the proper resources and command structures had not been devoted to something so important?

Instead, she and Chegar were going to be lucky to escape with their warframes intact.
She hoped, to whatever deity may still have existed, that Chegar&#39;s sub would be of a standard design, something she knew how to patch up on the fly, and not something unfamiliar, like the illegible consoles and unsafe reactor in this unauthorized facility.

Merulina shot out of the doorway into the docking bay, scattering Sentient stragglers.  With a playful flip of its tail, it sent its riders flying on a surprisingly accurate throw toward the submarine, and disappeared into the water.

Sharratmuri&#39;s landing on the tossing submarine was ungraceful one, with limbs spread out in all directions.  It was all she could do to not bounce off.

&quot;Shaken <em>and</em> stirred,&quot; she mumbled, moving to open the hatch.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="22-Aug-22 10:40 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The entire station violently combusted much more powerfully than the last one. It illuminated the entire battlefield, revealing a thin layer of sentient corpses piling at the bottom of the trench. The uncomfortable feeling of a mild aftershock coursed through Dominus&#39;s arch-suit. Muro felt it in his bones.

The aftershock sucker-punched Chegar and Sharratmuri&#39;s sub a couple kilometers, sending it spinning out of control. The two were viciously tossed, badly bruising their technocyte flesh. Chegar dislocated his shoulder, but Sharratmuri broke her leg.

As the dust settled, so too did the interference. Just enough for Isa&#39;s message to go through, and receive a reply:

Disruptis stood inside the third station, gazing out a nearby window. An entire armada of sentients surrounded him, launching volley after volley and swing after swing against the black and yellow Limbo to absolutely no avail. The veil of Rift surrounding him shrugged it all off.

Disruptis twisted his bright red gammacor to a different module and turned to give the reactor one last look. At the very end of the hall, it sat with its bulkhead doors wide open. A myriad of wires and equipment lay strewn across the floor after Disruptis had practically disassembled the entire thing and put it back together.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he spoke aloud to his chorus of enemies, &quot;but you don&#39;t get time to regroup.&quot;

He flicked the switch, and a low whirring sound filled the hall. In three seconds the primary lights flickered off. In another two, the backup lights failed as well as every drop of energy ceased to flow through the station. Disruptis ignited his plasma sword, casting cyan light over the shadows of his assailants. That involuntarily heat flared alive in the pit of his stomach as he looked over them with burning wrath.

&quot;Now, which one of you muckers dies first?&quot;

All the sentients froze in place. Disruptis flinched. He hadn&#39;t even ripped a cataclysm open yet. Then all in perfect sync, they turned their heads to look out the window. The Tenno spun around as well. There in the depths of the trench, a massive shadow moved. Neon green lights flickered to life all over a Mother class sentient. Its fractal design consisted of three ring-like structures surrounding a triangle in the middle.

&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Disruptis shouted in utter disbelief, slamming the window pane with a fist.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="25-Aug-22 08:49 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1011789762782298195 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1011789762782298195><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Aug-22 08:11 PM">20:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The remaining sentients gathered around him fled the facility in an unholy current of metal.

&quot;Hey guys? I disabled the third generator. He didn&#39;t nab anywhere near enough energy to come online, but he&#39;s up anyways! Ikazu is AWAKE! Regroup and hit him with everything we&#39;ve got, NOW.&quot;

Muro howled in agony as the shot ripped through his frame&#39;s leg, unable to take up any countermeasures against his similarly decimated opponent. Sinking to the sea floor, the Tenno tried his best to keep his focus despite the searing pain. Instinct told him to do something to staunch the damage to his leg, but he couldn&#39;t. Not here. Amidst his own nerves screaming in his head, Disruptis&#39; voice managed to cut through the noise. That announcement was the last straw. Drawing up all the strength he could, he dragged open a massive portal in the seabed in front of him, itself a void in an inky blackness darker than even the ocean around them.

From the depths of that portal, a mass of tentacles and scales tore loose, its gigantic shape obscured by the murky depths. The beast floated there for a moment before loosing an impossible number of cyan colored tentacles at the wounded Sentient champion, grabbing, pulling and tearing at it with terrifying ferocity.

With the portal open and his ace in the hole free, Muro fell forward onto the sandy seafloor.

Suddenly, his desperate struggle with the horde of Sentients ceased. Dominus watched in confusion as the mass streamed away from him, before Disruptis&#39;s voice suddenly cut through the static. They had comms back!

<em>&quot;Ikazu is AWAKE!&quot;</em>

He really wished they didn&#39;t have comms back. With no time to waste, the Excalibur set the archwing into high gear, following the stream of Sentients until he saw the massive body that comprised Ikazu&#39;s form. He was here, but...how was he supposed to <em>fight</em> this?

&quot;Dominus here, I&#39;m in position over Ikazu. I, um...I&#39;ll try whittling down the Sentient numbers, keep them from getting this big bastard free!

This time he wouldn&#39;t sit in place and just fire the Imperator at one or two pockets of enemies.

For several moments, Sharratmuri lay on the floor(?) of the submarine, staring up at the ceiling(?) splattered with technocyte hemolymph, in pain but glad to at least be alive.  Lucky that the submarine hadn&#39;t been crushed by the hydraulic shock.

A voice cut through her reverie, sharp and urgent.
&quot;<em>Ikazu is AWAKE! Regroup and hit him with everything we&#39;ve got, NOW.</em>&quot;

This was no time for resting after a difficult job.  This was the beginning of the <em>real</em> job.

She quickly glanced around, Chegar seemed to be in a similar situation as she was, and the Sentient arm-cannon was also scuffed and dented, but less so than the warframes.  Perhaps it had managed to partially adapt to blunt-force impact, but not quick enough to avoid damage entirely.  Whether it was still safe to use was an open question, which she hoped she wouldn&#39;t have to answer.

She sat up, and noticed the leg of her warframe bent in a way it shouldn&#39;t have been.  Broken.  She Transferred out, and stood up in her own Infestation-covered body, as chatter began to come through the submarine&#39;s comms system.  Lucky that it still worked.

The first voice had been unfamiliar, but this one she recognized, and the name.  <em>Dominus, huh.  Doesn&#39;t sound as confident as I remember.</em>  She stepped through the Void toward the pilot&#39;s console, and searched for some form of communications equipment (a headset, a button to push to talk, anything would work), debating internally whether this was really faster than trying to drag her warframe and its parazon over to the console.

Like the reactor and consoles in the facility, the submarine was not a design she&#39;d seen before, and the damage from shaking two warframes inside it didn&#39;t help.  She gave up, and transferred back to her warframe, making sure that its own comms were open.

Disruptis, she recognized that name.  A famous general, and he&#39;d been among the squad who&#39;d initially captured Ikazu.  It seemed he wasn&#39;t actually in charge here, though.

She remembered that Chegar had said there were four others who had come with him, and she mentally tallied up who she&#39;d heard.  The first voice who&#39;d announced Ikazu&#39;s awakening, Dominus who said they had a bomb, Muro who seemed to be missing (and so the first voice was probably Disruptis), and this last voice who seemed to be in charge and had &quot;the payload&quot;.

She answered the last transmission, in the same calm, no-nonsense tone:
&quot;Hit &#39;im in the head.  It&#39;s the bit in the middle, right smack in the center.  This is Sharratmuri.  I am, or was, the warden of this tomb.  Chegar is here also.  We destroyed a reactor and have escaped, but our warframes are damaged.&quot;

Dislocation: The Vauban had gotten lucky. Chegar quickly looked around, trying to gauge where everything had ended up: Weapons, Controls, Ally&#39;s Warframe:
Then came the Radio chatter. he recited what details he could in his mind, trying to fight through the pain:
-Ikazu  Awake
-Whittling down Sentient number
-Where&#39;s Muro?
-Pay load En-route
Chegar righted himself, Pulling himself to his feet with his remaining good arm. If he could get to the controls, he could get this vehicle moving in the right direction again. But not with his warframe down a functioning arm. He moved towards the controls, looking for a good way to get back in control with the sub in its new orientation. Once he had found a good anchor point, he grab the part the limb just distal to the dislocation, and quickly wrenched it back into place. His body lurched from the sudden relocation of the joint. He took a few brief, ragged gasps, steadied himself, and moved into position at the controls, using whatever anchor-points he could to keep himself oriented to the controls. With whatever hand(s) remained free, he directed the sub to face towards Ikazu&#39;s possition, making sure not to roll the vehicle; He wasn&#39;t about to cause any more damage to the Yareli than he help.

He began checking the weapon systems during the turn, Hoping to get them back up and running in time. With a damaged sub, and so many sub systems to be checked, he was going to be cutting it close.

&quot;Chegar Reporting in.&quot; He said, Finally lining up on his quarry. &quot;Moving to engage.&quot; He set the throttle to maximum.

The thought of being locked this deep in these mortifying depths gave the Limbo shivers. He gained a new sense of appreciation for the wake-up squads still scouring the system for sleeping Tenno.

&quot;Yeah, the head&#39;ll do,&quot; Disruptis chipped in, pulling away from the station in his sub. He caught a view of Ikazu&#39;s form from the myriad of lights that dotted it and felt the bottom of his stomach drop.

<em>Muckmuckmuckmuck all of that for this?!  I…</em>

He fished the cylindrical object out of his syandana. It was a simple metal stick with a red button on top. All of Disruptis&#39;s most important triggers were simple, as if a message to himself that life need not be complex. A fitting conclusion that this switch held his. An easy out, engineered from the dark places he found himself in the period after his soured reunion. It would destroy the place he now kept his operator body in with the fury of the Void, permanently sending him to the beyond. However with his Tenno form now on transference, it was no longer there. The switch would do little more than send a message to some important people that he was dead. Perfect then, if he was not planning on coming back without completing this mission.

The giant monster engulfed Tongar as the bleeding sentient looked up to glimpse it. Tentacles tore him limb from limb as if he were made of paper. Drained from the long battle, the commander could muster no energy to even struggle. In a matter of seconds, he was nothing but glittering scraps across the sea floor. 

Instead of luring fragments to him, Dominus caught something else. A massive circle of neon green light flickered on the front of Ikazu&#39;s form. Without another warning, a massive beam of plasma slammed Dominus on the side, searing half his Excalibur&#39;s torso through the diving suit before the ocean cooled him off. The pain was excruciating.

The blast bathed everyone in another round of light.~</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Blinding. The light from the beam, and the pain that lanced through his entire body. Ikazu was angry with him.

Good. It meant less energy that the behemoth was dedicating to freeing itself. The Excalibur rolled over, the impact from the attack having flung him backwards.

&quot;He&#39;s not just awake, his weaponry is online! That plasma just ripped right through my shields and scorched me bad! Be careful getting close to this thing!&quot;

Reactivating the thrust, Dominus started paying more attention to Ikazu itself, keeping up the barrage of fire, while watching for a repeat shot of that same weapon, or any other attack it might try. In the meantime, he took his chance at banter. Anything to distract this thing from its objective. His sword arm was itchy, but it was still too soon. Trying to carve through this thing was an exercise in futility, especially with all of the drones covering it.

&quot;Where&#39;s the quips, Ikazu? Usually at this point you Sentients like to remind us how worthless we are, or how everything we&#39;re doing is according to your grand design.

She fiddled with the crude interface with the bomb sub, plotting her route to the target and calculating the fuse time necessary to loose the sub toward its final destination and allow it to detonate while Isa moved her own damage craft away. Her allies knew what she was armed with and would stay far enough away if they knew what was good for them, or at least know to fall back when she gave the signal.

He was obviously still focused on the medical work at hand: It was the sudden surge of light from outside the sub that finally brought his focus back, having lost his  count of the seconds that had passed since throttle-up.  He&#39;d poured as much void into the injury as he could at this point, and quickly reassumed control of his warframe.

&quot;I can lob a targeting beacon as far as any other Tenno.&quot;  He said, now quickly trying to survey the battlefield ahead of them. &quot;If it&#39;s a matter of keeping us of of that things range, Strapping it to something and shooting it out a torpedo tube would be our best bet.

&quot;On that same note, I&#39;ll see if I can get a mech down here. hopefully we can get more than one; see if they&#39;ll hold under the pressure.&quot; Chegar continued, resuming his control of the sub.

&quot;See if you can put pressure on that leg now: I&#39;ll be easier to pilot this thing if I can get it upright.&quot; He said, unlocking the throttle, and continuing to push the sub towards Ikazu&#39;s position.

An impossibly deep sound reverberated out from Ikazu and throughout the rest of the trench, as if he were growling. The Tenno could feel it in their technocyte flesh. It was a guttural mix of emotions too jumbled to make sense of, but it seemed to convey something heavy nonetheless.

Dominus&#39;s barrage continued to chip away at the massive entity. Until the bullets stopped making contact. Its body had transformed into a blue-black shimmering veil of energy, much like an Oculyst.

&quot;Isa, ON ME! Bring the payload and follow behind me, to detonate on my mark,&quot; Disruptis roared, &quot;Chegar, Dominus, Sharratmuri, keep those PIECES OF SCRAP fragments OFF OF US! We&#39;ve got ONE shot at this so let&#39;s make it count.

He slammed his accelerator once again and took off, headed straight for Ikazu&#39;s head.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="01-Sep-22 09:36 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

</div></div>That sentence rang through Isa&#39;s skull for a moment before she responded.
&quot;Excellent. I know your plan.&quot;
She responded as she moved her sub now, heading toward Disruptis&#39; to fall in line with him. It was easy to guess really, and quite convenient. Limbo&#39;s own phasing could act as a counter to the sentients&#39;, and more importantly phasing out the bomb sub could mean it would affect only phased Sentients, rather than the Tenno subs. She shortened the fuse time. They wouldn&#39;t need to worry about escaping, provided Disruptis could manage to avoid being in limbo when the bomb went off. She sent a stream of data to Disruptis and Disruptis alone. The others didn&#39;t need to know and singling him out would make it ever so slightly less likely for the enemy to intercept the communication. He would receive two simple pieces of information.

Fuse: INACTIVE
Fuse time: 5 SECONDS

As Ikazu rose, her stomach sank.  She barely heard Disruptis informing everyone that Ikazu had figured out how to phase underwater, as if it wasn&#39;t plain for everyone to see.  Ikazu wasn&#39;t supposed to be able to do that - that was why he&#39;d been entombed here, in the deepest of oceans.

The only way to harm him now would be to Void-walk, or to enter the Rift.  Only a master of Zenurik would be able to enter the Void long enough to get out to Ikazu and back to the sub before having to return to the physical world, and while you were in the Void, what could you do?  Punch a building-sized monster with your tiny human fists?  Or channel all your void energy, which might not even be enough to kill the Sentient, and certainly wouldn&#39;t leave enough to get you back to safety.  No, Void-power was off the table for now.

That left the Rift.  Only a Limbo could do that, and Disruptis was famous for using one to great effect.  But that would only put them back to square one, able to shoot at and be shot at by Ikazu, and still with not enough firepower to take him out, except for that bomb...  <em>One chance...</em>

...Or, hit him with an orbital strike or two, that&#39;d do fine.  Now that she thought of it, where was the orbital support anyway?  Couldn&#39;t a ship or two be spared for dealing with such an emergency as Ikazu&#39;s awakening?  Were the Tenno really that strapped for resources?  <em>How bad is the war going up there?</em>

Ikazu stopped rising.  Tentacles wrapped around him in a cold, crushing embrace.
<em>Ah.  Someone has summoned a god.  That&#39;s helpful.</em>

Disruptis called out for Isa to send the payload after him, finally informing Sharratmuri of the name of the last member of the squad as he went for their One Shot.

She heard the command to keep the Sentients away from the payload, and clanced around the sub for some turret or weapons-control console... and then had another idea.

A god of the ocean depths, wrestling with an artificial god from space. But the only things that could kill that artificial god were a gaggle of teenagers piloting cybernetic fleshpuppets. Max grimaced from within the Excalibur, watching the Sentient amass a defensive line.

Then he grinned, the Imperator slotting into its mount on the archwing, Dominus clapping his palms together to remove the Exalted Blade from the Void. Drawing the Veritux with his free hand, the diving suit surged forward, the swordsman letting out a guttural shout.

&quot;Come on then, you bastards! If you won&#39;t stay dead, we&#39;ll just kill break down every last piece of you and scatter you into the winds! I&#39;m done playing nice!&quot;

The Voidstuff sword slid cleanly through lines of opponents, and the Veritux smashed its way through anything that tried to stop it, attempting to carve a path for the incoming bomb. An Excalibur with two blades in its hands, and determination in its soul, could only be described as one thing.

An extremely angry, visceral, devastating blender.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=knife><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🔪 src=main-story-06.html_Files/1f52a-CEEF9.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

A conculyst would slam its arm down only for the Excalibur&#39;s exalted blade to push aside the blow and split its head in two.

&quot;Isa… I&#39;ve burned too much Rift energy,&quot; he shakily replied, &quot;I..I can&#39;t shift something as big as the sub and contain its explosion without touching it directly.

He sent her message back with a small edit:

Disruptis clenched the switch stick until he felt the blood drain from his knuckles. No way back, no way out. He wasn&#39;t strong enough for that. Any other option couldn&#39;t succeed nearly as likely as this could. It might save himself, but would it save the system? Would it save the people he worked so hard to love? But what good would any of that be if he died at the bottom of the ocean where hardly anyone would ever know.

He&#39;d given up spending time with anyone around him that was still alive. Every excuse crawled along the back of his brain to explain why, but he knew the reason. He&#39;d secretly waited for someone to reach out to him, but no one ever did. Even the friends he had who were still alive were almost all missing. The floating feeling of loneliness in these inky depths was more suffocating than the darkness itself when he thought about dying here with little to grieve him. It was like he was back in that room aboard the Zariman before they pulled him out, staring at a white board full of ash and wondering how he got there. Or who he even was! Or the fact that not a SINGLE soul aboard that void-damn vessel even remembered him! He was a ghost amongst corpses, demons, and angels.

But he would do it. He would void-damn well make that sacrifice and he&#39;d do it again.

<em>That&#39;s how I&#39;ve been from the start. That&#39;s how I</em> decided <em>to be. If I lose that… well, what else would I have left?</em>

At this point, a small part of him might even welcome it. His mind had given up thinking of another way. Of thinking of hope. There was only what lay in front of him now.

&quot;Isa, if this explosion doesn&#39;t rip Ikazu apart and he destroys my Oro, can I get you to promise me something? Find somewhere it rains a lot and make me a grave. It doesn&#39;t have to be special, just a stone in the dirt. I never did find out what I was but I&#39;d like at least a tiny corner in your mind. If you can give me that…&quot; his voice faltered as he teared up. 

<em>Isa doesn&#39;t care about this scrap,</em> he thought sorrowfully.

&quot;Everybody else, get as far away from the explosion radius as you can. If I fail to contain it, losing more Tenno is gonna sink this entire operation faster than the scraps of my destroyed warframe will.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="06-Sep-22 09:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;He&#39;s actually going to do it...&quot; Chegar said under his breath.
He quickly checked his own energy reserves: just enough for a few remaining mines. But what could he do with that? 
Boost the sub maybe? Makes for a faster retreat. But even if it did help the squad extract faster, if Ikazu survived the blast, they&#39;d all be well behind the ball: Deep under water and miles away from any way to resupply. And the only way to get out of there near instantly would be to perform a ship recall; currently out of the question due to their depth under the vast Uranian ocean.

Tethers and flechettes were out of the question too: you can&#39;t tie down something that&#39;ll phase through solid matter, and you certainly can&#39;t stab or shoot it.

That only left the overdrivers : But overdrive what? The Subs Guns? No. the torpedo&#39;s? Same problem, so no. which left only one weapon left to overdrive:

The Payload.

&quot;Oh.. hell with it.&quot; Chegar finally muttered. He quickly diverted off, pushing the sub at full speed to intercept the payload. &quot;Sharratmuri, hang on to something.&quot; He quickly said before turning his attention back to the COMMs system.  &quot;Okay Dis; this plan is absolutely nuts. But if you&#39;re still keen to blow yourself up, I&#39;ve got an idea that may just make this Hail-Marry of yours a bit more volatile.&quot; He said, his attention split between steering, and splicing together the remaining overdrivers into one mass, tuning them to focus and hone-in on the bomb. He slid the final product towards Sharratmuri, turned to her and quickly said &quot;If you can, slide that into one of the torpedo&#39;s and launch the whole thing: we&#39;ll need as much bang as we can get.&quot; He returned his attention to the COMMs. 
&quot;There should be a care package heading your way soon; Make sure it make contact with the payload, &#39;cause when that thing goes boom, it&#39;s going to be punching well above its weight.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="09-Sep-22 11:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Sentients swarming the submarine had become more like a hazy cloud of scrap and falling debris, but still, he cut. As Disruptis gave what felt like a self-eulogy, he cut. And Dominus spoke.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t expect to die here. Whether that bomb only takes you, Ikazu, or both of you out, you&#39;d better not think this means you get a break. I got dragged into this party, and I expect the host to see me out the door, or offer me a job, whatever the hell operation you might be running.&quot;

One last cut, the projected wave of the Exalted Blade shearing through a final line of Sentients. The Excalibur&#39;s energy ran dry, but he gripped the Veritux with both hands and merely kept slamming the drones aside with the weight and edge of the blade.

&quot;You&#39;re trying to be a hero, and there&#39;s a part of my brain that resonates with that. But there&#39;s another part of my brain that&#39;s sick and <em>tired</em> of hearing all these stories of heroic sacrifices, and I don&#39;t feel like adding another to the collection. You&#39;ve got amnesia too, right? All the legends in the world won&#39;t mean a damn thing if no one knows who <em>you</em> really are. I want answers for these shadowy parts of my brain, and I imagine you do too. There&#39;s only one way to get those.&quot;

As Dominus finally peeled away from the fighting, putting distance between himself and the eventual, colossal explosion, he felt a small nick of emotion force its way into his heart. An authority that seemed familiar, and yet so alien. These weren&#39;t his soldiers. Why did he feel this way? But Max embraced it all the same. Behind that authority was something else. Something he couldn&#39;t yet see.

&quot;Zero it is. On your signal, then.&quot;
She said, monotone and enigmatic as usual, adjusting the fuse time accordingly as the trio of subs maneuvered closer to position.

&quot;Disruptis, if this fails to destroy Izaku, <em>I</em> will destroy your Oro. And then sure, I will make you a grave in the rainiest place I know.&quot;
Was that a joke? With her general lack of intonation it was difficult to tell to say the least.

&quot;Enough with sentimentality, we have something to kill.&quot;
Her attention went to the sensors, looking for the promised care package, ready to maneuver the bomb sub to make contact with it, having an idea of what it was.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="10-Sep-22 03:51 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;He&#39;s actually going to do it...&quot; Chegar said under his breath.
He quickly checked his own energy reserves: just enough for a few remaining mines. But what could he do with that? 
Boost the sub maybe? Makes for a faster retreat. But even if it did help the squad extract faster, if Ikazu survived the blast, they&#39;d all be well behind the ball: Deep under water and miles away from any way to resupply. And the only way to get out of there near instantly would be to perform a ship recall; currently out of the question due to their depth under the vast Uranian ocean.

Tethers and flechettes were out of the question too: you can&#39;t tie down something that&#39;ll phase through solid matter, and you certainly can&#39;t stab or shoot it.

That only left the overdrivers : But overdrive what? The Subs Guns? No. the torpedo&#39;s? Same problem, so no. which left only one weapon left to overdrive:

The Payload.

&quot;Oh.. hell with it.&quot; Chegar finally muttered. He quickly diverted off, pushing the sub at full speed to intercept the payload. &quot;Sharratmuri, hang on to something.&quot; He quickly said before turning his attention back to the COMMs system.  &quot;Okay Dis; this plan is absolutely nuts. But if you&#39;re still keen to blow yourself up, I&#39;ve got an idea that may just make this Hail-Marry of yours a bit more volatile.&quot; He said, his attention split between steering, and splicing together the remaining overdrivers into one mass, tuning them to focus and hone-in on the bomb. He slid the final product towards Sharratmuri, turned to her and quickly said &quot;If you can, slide that into one of the torpedo&#39;s and launch the whole thing: we&#39;ll need as much bang as we can get.&quot; He returned his attention to the COMMs. 
&quot;There should be a care package heading your way soon; Make sure it make contact with the payload, &#39;cause when that thing goes boom, it&#39;s going to be punching well above its weight.&quot; </span> <span class=chatlog__reference-edited-timestamp title="09-Sep-22 11:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(108,63,0) title=ChronicallyDehydrated#7813 data-user-id=482587075602808851>UnremarkableUsername-Sharratmuri</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1018224870993174558>10-Sep-22 02:22 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Sharratmuri:</strong>
<em>What...</em>
There were the torpedoes on the wall, somehow still in their racks after the past few eventful hours.  And there was Chegar&#39;s pile of Overdrivers, the Void-summoned magical spirit of Macgyver in physical form.  And she was supposed to put that into the torpedo.  Without tools.
<em>How...?</em>

<em>I can&#39;t--</em>
She opened her mouth, and then closed it.
<em>--huh.  Actually...</em>

She unhooked one end of a torpedo from its rack, and it fell to the floor with a thud.  

Transference, back into the warframe.  Check energy... almost full, surprisingly.  <em>Must be from the destroyed Sentients outside.</em>  She stood and, careful not to put weight on the warframe&#39;s broken leg, walked the few steps to the torpedo and lifted the other end out of its rack, so that it stood upright, leaning against the wall.  She stepped back and cast Aquablades.

Aquablades could cut armor.  It had no trouble cutting a torpedo in half, though it did take several seconds to grind its way through.

The severed nose-section of the torpedo fell to the floor with another thud.  She rolled it out of the way, gently tipped the tail section onto the ground, and Transferred back out.

The Vauban-summoned Overdrivers were designed to stick to things when thrown, and so she slid the jury-rigged pile over to the warhead-less torpedo, and pressed the two pieces together.

But how to get it into the tube?  Outside her warframe, she was just a scrawny kid, there was no way she could lift it.  Inside her warframe, it wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but the frame&#39;s leg wasn&#39;t in any condition to take that weight.

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Dominus&#39;s last few words sent a jolt down Disruptis&#39;s spine, forcing him to stand up straight and pull his arm halfway into a sign of salutation. The movement was instinctual and unnerving--as if something about Dominus demanded it--but it jostled his mind out of the rut it had sunk into.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">&quot;We’d all prefer a live friend than a dead war hero.&quot;
</div></div>
Disruptis&#39;s mouth hung agape. It had been so, so long since he had interacted with new fellow tenno, fighting the same fight he did. He had almost forgot there were tenno who, in their mutual past history of suffering, looked out for each other. When he had originally been forsaken by the Lotus, that&#39;s a lot of what he was looking for in the Orokin Remnant. Like-minded individuals united in a common goal of finally fixing something. And now by some blessed twist of fate that had come to him. Almost as if to remind him of the hope that life promises. That though one&#39;s waist may sink in the valleys of suffering, if they still draw breath from their body there are always more chances on the other side of the hill. More chances for whatever they might need. One only has too keep trudging forwards.

Was he really going to lay down in the mud?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018670462148018268 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018670462148018268><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 07:52 PM">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Before he knew it, the Limbo was a stone&#39;s throw away from Ikazu&#39;s restrained body. It was now or never.

&quot;Everybody finish what you&#39;re doing and leg it!&quot; he exclaimed, walking over to the exit hatch and blowing the seal off of it. 

He pulled himself into the folds of the Rift as the ocean crashed over him and flooded the sub. Disruptis exited the sub as it sunk, like a lizard shedding its skin. He felt the intense weight of the ocean squeezing his Rift parallelled body. It took way more energy and focus to keep the energy around him than he could have ever hoped, but he did it. He pushed off and grabbed the cold metal of the bomb sub.

~Sharratmuri pulled the torpedo surgery off with expert precision. The rush repair done by Chegar made her leg much easier to stand on than she thought. The torpedo slid into the slot. All that was left to do was to fire it.~</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The modified archwing was in remarkable shape, given the battle it had seen today. Damaged, yes, but stable, and Dominus was all the more grateful for it. It carried him far away from the impending explosion, staring at Ikazu&#39;s struggling body. His grip on the Veritux tightened, frustrated. Rift powers, spores, enhanced technology and water manipulation...and he was just good with a sword. As much good as that was against a thing like a mother-class Sentient.

&quot;Do it, dammit. Take this mucker out so we can call it a day!&quot;

Turning over, now looking at the ocean floor, the Excalibur spotted a figure, floating in the murk and wreckage of the colossal battle. As he came in closer, he IDed Muro&#39;s comatose frame, and settled to a stop nearby, turning back to face the direction he&#39;d come from. It was too difficult to see the subs, but he could still make out Ikazu and the Kraken, scrabbling for advantage as his fellow Tenno placed the charge.

&quot;So the Kraken&#39;s your handiwork...not bad, ocean man. You&#39;re going to be the reason we had a shot at winning. If you can hear me in there, cross your fingers. I&#39;ve got mine twisted up.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Clinging to the bomb sub and listening to the rush of the Rift around his head, Disruptis watched the lights of his fellow Tenno pull away from the blast zone. The people who had come with him this far. Veritable heroes, who for some are acting out all they know and have ever been. Who looked into the swirling depths of a rotten facility yet still plunged themselves down in an effort to pull the plug stopping its drain. Though one of them may think little of things like heroism and are more concerned with their fancy and weight of their purse, they are at least faithful to contract no matter the complication. All that was left was for him to fulfill his responsibility as part of these motley band of heroes. And maybe even give beyond that.

Once they were away, Disruptis placed two hands on the cold metal hull of the bomb sub. He struggled to grasp onto it with his right hand until he realized it was because his palm still held the switch. If there was any moment to use it it would be now. He wouldn&#39;t be able to press it after his body was obliterated. He disengaged the lock on its button and hovered a finger over it. Pressing this very button meant he wasn&#39;t optimistic in his chances of escaping this alive. Pressing it meant he wanted to tell the world to move on without him. Pressing it would settle his mind on the matter.

<em>At least Isa is gonna put me somewhere it rains. Even if it&#39;s acid,</em> Disruptis mused sadly.

<strong>CLUNK</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021224336499146793 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021224336499146793><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 09:00 PM">21:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The sub shook as something slammed into it from behind. Disruptis panicked, dreading a sentient attack, only to find a pile of Overdrivers latched to the back of the sub. It took everything he had not to accidentally drop the button. The Tenno watched them blink for a second, processing the sight. This group of companions was really trying everything they could do to make sure he got out of there. It touched the funny yellow Limbo to the core of his heart. He looked to his opponent: a thrashing monstrous symbol that despised chaos to the point of wishing to destroy everything in its way so that stagnation be preserved. He didn&#39;t remember ever being this close to a mother class Sentient&#39;s head.

<em>Wait, I&#39;ve never</em> been <em>so close to his head.</em>

Disruptis perked up. There were only two ways to damage a phased Phantom. You either damage it from inside the Rift or... But was it worth the risk? The sub had much better odds of success.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><em><strong>I order you to live.</strong></em>
</div></div>
Disruptis locked the button and shoved it back into his syandana.

&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Disruptis screamed in the darkness, broadcasting his communication out loud to make sure Ikazu could hear what he was about to say. &quot;You know what? They&#39;re right. Enough of us have died for a MILLENNIA! Even if this System is going to the Void, I&#39;ve come TOO FAR to give everything up now! There&#39;s still a chance for me to stand on that mucking horizon.&quot;

He bullet jumped off the sub, twirling through the ocean like a torpedo. The Limbo reached out an arm as Ikazu&#39;s head flew by and latched onto it like a vice grip. He took one look into the towering sentient&#39;s large, burning eyes.

&quot;So let&#39;s see just how mucking far I&#39;ve come.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="29-Sep-22 12:38 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021224413582065736 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021224413582065736><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 09:01 PM">21:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This time Disruptis didn&#39;t have to think of the past. He thought of the future. He thought of everything that could still come. From the clasp of a new friend to the embrace of someone special still waiting out there. He fuelled his determination, which gave rise to that familiar feeling. He pushed as much Rift energy as he held in his arms straight into the section of Ikazu that made up his head and main processing capabilities. The veil of the Rift expanded across him like a cacophony of crawling insects. As it did, the energy clashed with the phased material and brought it back to the physical plane, where it was exposed. The light of a brewing laser began spilling from Ikazu&#39;s chest, but it was too late.

&quot;NOW!!!!&quot;

Isa triggered the detonation. A blindingly bright ball of plasma tore the ocean open, defying the crushing weight of its depths. It melted and fused the nanostructures comprising Ikazu&#39;s body, then it collapsed with devastating force, pounding that very metal to powder. The tear was so violent that it obliterated all sentient fragments gathered around his body. It even tore chunks from the Kraken&#39;s own tentacles.

A gaping hole sat where Ikazu&#39;s head used to be and--as a result of this final gambit--Disruptis, with barely enough strength left to keep the Rift covering him, gazed into the wreckage. The thrashing of the sentient halted abruptly, and it fell limp in the Kraken&#39;s grasp. Disruptis cracked a grin.

Which quickly faded. The mark embedded on his gammacor flared to life, finally within reach to sniff something it didn&#39;t like.

There, in the very hole he had just opened up, stretched a network of gooey, neon green pseudopods connecting to every single of the sentient&#39;s muscle fibers. At the center of it all sat a huge sphere of goo plastered underneath a large, obsidian colombina mask. Its substance vibrated as if in annoyance, and a frown full of jagged teeth slid into existence below its mask.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021224438164901938 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021224438164901938><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 09:01 PM">21:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-json">&quot;Brother Disruptis!

Its voice reverberated throughout the ocean, forcibly transmitting itself through all communications it could find.

&quot;SINGULARITIS!&quot; Disruptis exclaimed in shock as more pseudopods shot out from the creature and latched themselves around the Limbo&#39;s limbs, &quot;Why-- why are you buddy-ing up with our very enemies?! Are you out of your mind?!&quot;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-json">&quot;My plans are beyond any of our feeble family&#39;s comprehension.

&quot;YOU&#39;RE INSANE if you think our progenitor wants it any other way!&quot; Disruptis retorted, &quot;that&#39;s why he approved of sister Weaver locking you up. There&#39;s NO WAY in the Void you&#39;re out here with his consent!&quot;

Disruptis instinctively choked as the last of his Rift power slipped away, leaving him defenseless. The ocean began denting his warframe like a can of Corpa Cola. He immediately broadcasted an SOS to all other Tenno.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had, as promised, de-summoned Merulina when Disruptis called for the explosion to go off, but she was left with hardly any energy.  A casting of Aquablades, and then of Riptide, while keeping Meru summoned the whole time, had left her warframe quite drained.

She steadied herself, crouching to the floor as the shockwave shook the sub.

A moment of silence.  &quot;Some-&quot;
A voice cut her off, the eldritch voice of the Entity that had dwelt inside Ikazu.

As soon as it finished, she continued.
&quot;Somebody needs to pick up his body.  I&#39;d volunteer, but Chegar is piloting, so that&#39;s his call.  Then we run; at least one of us is in no condition to fight.  I heard there were six of us, are all accounted for?  Isa, Dominus, Muro?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With the bomb detonate, there was no more need for the cord extending from the sub, so Isa cut it and began making her way back in the direction of the now obliterated sentients. It seemed that something had survived the blast, something that wasn&#39;t Disruptis. This issue would need to be rectified. Isa had no idea what it was, but anything that lived that close to a Sentient mother had no right to exist and would be eliminated with extreme prejudice.

Disruptis was also alive and sending out an SoS. It would be risky trying to pick him up, but she might be able to. Her shields and armor could potentially last the few seconds needed to scoop up what remained of the body and reseal the sub. That is if no one else got to him first. For now though she kept an eye out for whatever this new entity was, and would shoot on sight provided it was far enough from Disruptis that the grenades wouldn&#39;t further damage the frame that was already in the process of being crushed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Chock full of friends, huh.&quot;

The archwing kicked off at its fullest potential, following the line he&#39;d left behind. As he did so, he stowed away the Veritux, having no intentions of trying to fight whatever had spawned in Ikazu&#39;s place.

&quot;Alright, listen up, I have a plan. I don&#39;t have much in the tank, but if I feed Dis what little energy I&#39;ve got left, he may be able to Rift for just a second while I fling him at your subs. Chegar, Sharr, you&#39;re the pickup, there&#39;s at least a chance we can keep him from crashing out of his Limbo if Chegar can heal him. Isa, I want you on cover, if anything, and I mean <em>anything</em> tries to stop me, lay into it with everything you&#39;ve got left. I&#39;ll protect Dis&#39;s frame with my body, the shields will take what they can. If he can&#39;t Rift out,  figure <em>something</em> out. Now go!&quot;

Buzzing by the submarines, the Excalibur wasted no time waiting to see if they would follow his strategy. He didn&#39;t even know if whatever this green <em>thing</em> was would let him either.

Energy started trickling into Dominus&#39;s palms, reaching for Disruptis&#39;s swiftly crumpling body. It was almost unnerving, seeing this Qliphothian entity looming over him. Over all of them. It should, by all rights, fill him with horror and dread.

But he had had a <em>very</em> long day.

&quot;Listen, you two-bit excuse for an occultic lightshow! We&#39;re bugging out, with <em>everyone</em> we brought along, and I won&#39;t let you get in the way!&quot;

Another surge of energy, pulling from his very depths. Trying to <em>push</em> his own inner Void towards Disruptis. That he might hear him. That he could fling the poor soul to safety.

&quot;So be a good little tentacled freak, and FUCK OFF ALREADY!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa drove the sub in closer, taking careful aim at the back of the cavity. She may be rather enigmatic toward her compatriots, but by now she they would have hopefully figured out that she was highly skilled in two areas, one of them being explosives, and not just making the biggest boom possible. She had a special knack for picking the right amount of explosives needed, and applying them in just the right place.

He readied himself: when the sub makes contact with the archwing, his aim will be to nudge it, not splatter it against the hull.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="26-Sep-22 05:10 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It would take a lot to shake Muro from his nigh-comatose state, his full attention kept on attempting to mend his frame remotely. An explosion powerful enough to eradicate a giant Sentient, however, would prove just powerful enough. The shockwave, while not harmful to the damaged Hydroid, was enough to bring his awareness back to the present moment. Shakily raising his head from the sea floor, he took in as much of the scene as the darkness around him would permit. From what he could tell, not only was the giant Sentient seemingly out of commission, but his abyssal ally seemed to be wreaking a great deal of havoc in the Sentient&#39;s ranks, a fact he took some satisfaction from. With no small amount of effort, he attempted to bring himself back up to something approximating a standing position before taking a quick look at his own injuries.

To say his warframe was in tatters would be something of an understatement, to say nothing of its missing leg. Wincing from the pain, he called out over comms, hoping someone could actually hear him.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Muro croaked. &quot;Are we done here or what?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even as Disruptis witnessed his potential doom barreling his way, he couldn&#39;t help but smile when he heard Muro speak up.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there man,&quot; he rasped.

~Dominus&#39;s archwing began speeding up even faster. A very concerning prospect since the vehicle was supposed to already have been at its max speed, but it was going even faster now. The thrusters had grown 30% in size through some inexplicable effect.

Despite the increase in speed, Chegar&#39;s sub was able to spin around and catch up even with a drive by some very conveniently placed fragments of sentients. He touched the vessel&#39;s nose to the archwing from behind and forcefully guided it off its trail. The two blew past the suspended Disruptis and drifted out to the open sea. He couldn&#39;t get Dominus to stop though, and the archwing tried to course correct and overcome its obstacle.

Isa&#39;s grenades struck true, detonating a series of very devastating explosions thanks to the highly pressurized water. Pieces of the green monster tore off its body, but was quickly replaced by insane levels of regeneration. Needless to say, its expression showed that the Tenno&#39;s actions were very infuriating.~ 

<strong>Singularitis:</strong>
Singularitis let out what sounded like a deep sigh.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-json">&quot;Why must humans be such infernal pests? It would do good for you to hope that you never cross paths with me again, because the next hour we do I will provision you my... *full*... attention. That moment may come soon. I can feel the ripples. Until then, be sure to inform my worthless little brother to never forget it.&quot;</code>

Singularitis&#39;s body glowed with a vibrancy that filtered through the darkness. The light grew in intensity until with a flash, he was gone, leaving a short-lived, swirling vortex of Void energy in his wake.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="30-Sep-22 12:04 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sharratmuri pried at a second electrical panel, feeling siphoned energy flow into her warframe from the floating remains of Sentients as the sub passed by them, and bracing herself for a fight.  

Of six Tenno (including herself), two were unconscious and another was strapped to a one-way ticket out of the picture.  They were faced with an endoparasitic Void-entity of seemingly incomprehensible power, able not only to subvert their technology much as a Sentient could, but also completely take control of an entire Mother-class Sentient, and regenerate damaged or destroyed parts of itself seemingly instantly.  And Isa had just pissed it off.  Sure, there happened to be a god restraining it, the Kraken that Muro had summoned, but the Kraken had seemed evenly matched to Ikazu, which this creature had seemingly killed.

Muro and Disruptis spoke.  Two Tenno not unconscious then, but definitely not in fighting condition, not even close.

She finished with the second panel and let it drop to the floor, and started a third.  She braced herself for a difficult fight, a retreat under fire, or whatever it was that Singularitis could throw at them.  A fight that at least some of the Tenno might not survive.

Chegar nudged Dominus&#39;s archwing off its collision course with Disruptis.  Isa fired a shot at Singularitis.  The fight had begun.

Disaster averted.  Or just delayed, most likely, but averted at least for now.

Sharratmuri finished prying off the third panel, and with it dropped a few of her grandmother&#39;s choicest ancient cusswords.

&quot;...Jesus fucking christ...&quot;

Singularitis had called Disruptis &quot;little brother&quot;.  Perhaps it was some sort of patron-entity, like the Man in the Wall.  But it had also spoken of &quot;our mission&quot;, and implied that the goal was exterminating the Sentients.  And it had spoken of &quot;our family&quot; also pursuing the same mission.  This lead to another possibility.  <em>Was that a fucking <strong>Tenno</strong>?</em>  And a smaller thought: <em>If <strong>that</strong> was a Tenno... could <strong>I</strong> become like that?  Could all of us?</em>

But first, the tail end of the crisis.  Dominus&#39;s archwing was out of control, but he would be crushed by the depth if he tried to unstrap from it.  Disruptis was safely in the Rift, but was running low on energy, and would be crushed as soon as he ran out.

One of those, she had a solution for.  With her warframe&#39;s recharged energy, she summoned Merulina and instructed it:  &quot;Take the Limbo.  Go to the air bubble.  Fast.  ...Yes, jellyfish afterward.  Go.&quot;

With Singularitis seeming to having abandoned the fight, Chegar took a slightly relieved breath. However, With Dominus&#39;s archwing still out of his control, and Disruptis still at deaths door, time was still not on his side.

&quot;What I&#39;d do for a nullifier right now...&quot; Chegar mused. He returned his attention to the COMMs &quot;Dom, Give us something to work with here: Any thoughts as to how to get that thing back under control?&quot;

With the archwing still pushing to get back on course, Chegar redirected the sub on a lazy spiral, gently forcing the two vehicles to orbit Disruptis&#39;s position. with any luck, it would give Sharratmuri a chance to deploy Merulina without the archwing interfering.

That&#39;s when he heard Muro come over the line. &quot;Good to hear you&#39;re still with us.&quot; He said quickly, now trying to take stock of his options. &quot;Isa, Muro, What&#39;s our state of play here? I&#39;ve got a rouge archwing pinned to my side and it&#39;s not giving me much to work with.

Hurtling around in the water with an out-of-control jet backpack wasn&#39;t exactly his idea of a good time. As Singularitis disappeared, the Excalibur had hoped that his effect on his archwing would fade too. But if it was fading, it was taking awhile to do so.

&quot;Seems like whatever he did morphed the thing. The thrusters are huge, and I&#39;m trying to send orders to ramp down the output, but it&#39;s not making it through. I&#39;ve got some alternatives in mind. I&#39;m thinking either trying to get me to ram the last tower so I can eject and then mount up with one of you guys, or we force my angle upwards until I exit crush depth, and I eject there.&quot;

Muro&#39;s voice was a welcome inclusion into the conversation, and Dominus took that advantage.

&quot;If Muro&#39;s still got enough gas, he could easily be my course corrector. How bad is that damage, though? I don&#39;t want to risk you falling apart just trying to get me out of this thing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The grenades apparently were not enough to kill the thing, but they did their purpose to neutralize the threat for now. She began piloting her sub toward Disruptis&#39;s limbo, slowing as she approached to gently let him collide with the sub and rest against it before taking him toward the nearest intact tower, intent on getting him inside so she could open up her own sup to let him in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Disruptis reached out to grab onto Isa&#39;s sub only to realize his hands had been blown off by the explosion. Without an easy way to grab a hold of it, he flailed around helplessly. Then Merulina shot by, scooping him up like a stretcher and positioning herself on the front of Isa&#39;s sub so she could take advantage of its speed. Disruptis closed his eyes to the sound of rushing water and focused on keeping his Rift up. Dominus&#39;s archwing tracked the change in movement, but it couldn&#39;t get out of Chegar&#39;s Fortuna drift.

With a large splash, Merulina came soaring out of the bay waters and into the now darkened station. Disruptis slid off of her and rolled along the ground, the last of his Rift energy dispersing. The Limbo pushed himself up onto his knees and expelled the dense seawater from his warframe&#39;s lungs with a thick cough. He shakily pulled himself into a seat against a wall.

&quot;Fathermucker,&quot; he groaned with the hints of a smile in his voice, &quot;I haven&#39;t been near this rocked since that one sentient I flushed out of my airlock.&quot;

As she watched the kraken&#39;s tentacle wrap around the sub, covering some of the windows, she said nothing.  Surely this was the end.  Even a group of six Tenno had no more chance of harming the Kraken than harming Ikazu, and three of the six were now only able to watch from a distance.  Against Ikazu, they&#39;d at least had one chance, in the form of a large improvised explosive.  Now, that had been used.

She holstered the sheev, and waited for the sub to be crushed.

Instead, the kraken flicked the sub away like a bug that wasn&#39;t worth squishing.  Sharratmuri, unprepared, bounced off the insides of the submarine, along with Chegar, the cut-off front half of a torpedo, three loose electrical panels, and the severed Simbilyst&#39;s laser-arm which <em>definitely</em> wouldn&#39;t be safe to fire now.

Once the sub had stabilized, she Transferred out of the warframe and surveyed the damage.

As soon as the black and yellow Limbo rolled off her back, Merulina dove back into the water.  That was it then, wasn&#39;t it?  The black and yellow Limbo was in the air bubble, and the self-declared queen of rainstorms hadn&#39;t given her any further instructions.  But she also hadn&#39;t been de-summoned yet, so...

Isa was about to exit the sub when she saw the Excalibur crash against the window.
&quot;I&#39;ll get him.&quot; She said before taking the sub back into the airlock and leaving, piloting it back around toward the Excalibur, gingerly trying to get it to balance on the the gun that protruded from it. Hopefully Dominus would still be conscious enough to help with that endeavor. Once he was satisfactorily secured on the gun, she brought the sub back to the airlock.

The tentacle crushing the diving suit and flinging him into the side of the tower left him breathless, quite literally as his protection against the external water pressure crumpled. Isa&#39;s quick thinking was able to pull him in however, as his arms gripped onto the sub&#39;s gun long enough for them to return to the airlock.

Cracking noises filled his ears as they went however. Possibly the ribs of the Warframe breaking from the combined damage? He couldn&#39;t tell, and it was with barely a breath in his body that he was effectively flung into comfortable pressure again, flopping to the floor of the tower. Water dribbled out of the suit, and most of the frame&#39;s nooks and crannies. He mumbled, more to himself than anything else.

&quot;I think. That I might be done with underwater missions for awhile.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Disruptis approached, and stuck out his hand, the Excalibur gingerly held out his own, and met it, gripping with a surprising strength. He was exhausted, but he still had that telltale fire in him.

Muro&#39;s battered form visibly relaxed as his otherworldly ally disappeared through the rift, taking its prize with it.

Sharratmuri stood, carefully in case some pipe had broken and leaked on the floor, and walked to one of the sub&#39;s tiny windows.

Outside, the Kraken disappeared back into the Void with its prey, and in the distance a shimmer passed as Merulina sought hers.  Sharratmuri smiled.  At least those two were ending the day on a net positive.

Chegar&#39;s quip drew her attention back inside. &quot;<em>Party at Twenty Thousand Leagues: BYOB.</em>&quot;  There was some banter on the comms, evidently.  Catching it would require Transferring back into the damaged warframe, which would hurt... Maybe best not to... No, it&#39;d be worth it.

She grit her teeth and used Transference again.  As predicted, it hurt.  A lot.  But still, not enough to be an issue for a follower of Unairu, the school of endurance and resilience.

Just in time to hear Dominus.  &quot;<em>...indicative of that. I have the faintest memory of being way more serious in the Old War.</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>Old War</em>&quot;, he&#39;d said, &quot;<em>faintest memory.</em>&quot;

<em>So it&#39;s over, then.  It&#39;s over.  Long over.</em>
<em>How long was I asleep?</em>

Muro spoke.  He was alive, and on his way under his own power.  That was good, then.  Everyone accounted for.

Her warframe&#39;s energy ran out, and she felt/heard a peep of mild annoyance from Meru as she disappeared into the Void.  <em>Heh,</em> she thought, <em>Enough jellyfish for you anyway.</em>

It seemed there was still much work to do in the world, and the Tenno were doing it.  Fighting remains of Sentients, trying to clean up after the Orokin, as they&#39;d agreed they would do after the Orokin fell.  <em>Ah, no...</em> She couldn&#39;t be sure the Orokin were gone yet, that was too bold of an assumption.  Too optimistic.

She had so many questions that needed answers.  But better asked in person, to the group.

Anyway, Dis was a good speaker, as he&#39;d been reported and rumored to be.  Definitely sounded like the seasoned and wizened general that he was.

She waited several moments.

Sometimes the situations around you are not just an excuse, and despite your best efforts you fail. But that&#39;s just life. In a world where so much evil fights itself sometimes you just get caught up in the crossfire. But I know now that it&#39;s then that it&#39;s most important to keep pulling yourself forward. Learning from those failures...</em>&quot;

It seemed there was still much work to do in the world, and the Tenno were doing it.  Fighting remains of Sentients, trying to clean up after the Orokin, as they&#39;d agreed they would do after the Orokin fell.  <em>Ah, no...</em> She couldn&#39;t be sure the Orokin were gone yet, that was too bold of an assumption.  Too optimistic.

She had so many questions that needed answers.  But better asked in person, to the group.

Anyway, Dis was a good speaker, as he&#39;d been reported and rumored to be.  Definitely sounded like the seasoned and wizened general that he was.

She waited several moments.

&quot;So!  How&#39;s everybody&#39;s day going?  And speakin&#39; of learning and bouncing back, anybody know where&#39;s the nearest unemployment office?&quot;

“I can agree to that. There’s nothing I hate more than the idea of a hopeless endeavor.”

He pushed himself to a sitting position, wincing slightly as it compressed his ribs. He thought about Transferring out for a moment, but decided to stomach the pain for now.

“I remember seeing suffering. Kids hurting, crying, losing their family in a hell unlike anything I’d ever heard of. That’s the one thing I could really retain, even when every other memory got swept away. When Intellectus got through to me, and I woke up? Realized I could make a difference?”

Dominus let out a sigh. And then his voice took on a slightly more optimistic tone.

“I fought. And I’ve kept fighting. Maybe there’s no fixing things permanently, but for every day I fight, that’s a little extra time bought for the rest.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Muro couldn&#39;t help but shake his head at the group speaking. &quot;Not to ruin the banter, but how&#39;s about we save the congratulations and small talk until <em>after</em> we&#39;re out of here, huh?&quot; He attempted to continue paddling forward, biting back pangs of pain each time he attempted to move his stump of a leg. &quot;Thanks for the assist, Isa. Realizing now that I really shouldn&#39;t be moving any more than I have to.&quot; With that, he stopped, waiting for Isa to retrieve him.

&quot;Don&#39;t know who you are newbie&quot; He said wearily, presumably to the Yareli. &quot;But there&#39;s nothing new to learn. Its the same story as the old days: shoot at anything that shoots at you and clean up after the Orokin&#39;s messes.

Disruptis nodded in understanding. A memory surfaced in his mind prompting his hands to rummage the folds of his syandana. He frowned, unable to find what he was looking for. He gave up and placed a hand on Dominus&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Listen, I&#39;m not sure if this&#39;ll help but I know someone who might be able to sort your amnesia problem for you. He&#39;s a whimsical Tenno, but he&#39;s got a good heart. If his &#39;flow&#39; happens to align with you I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll put you on the right path at the very least.&quot;

Disruptis virtually sent him the details of a Tenno named &#39;The Strider&#39;, along with a small physical description. &quot;I don&#39;t actually know where he is now, but I&#39;m sure you can find out if you ask around a Relay.&quot;

With the return of everyone to the station, Disruptis clapped his hands together with finality. &quot;Plenty of time to talk on the sub ride upwards,&quot; he announced, side eyeing Chegar&#39;s busted sub, &quot;I think it&#39;s a great idea if we all huddled into Isa&#39;s sub. It won&#39;t be much of a squeeze, but it&#39;ll be cozy. Beats having a sub breakdown in the middle of our way up though.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="26-Oct-22 07:29 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He silently reached up and gripped Dis&#39;s hand with his own, squeezing it in understanding once the message was passed. He then went over to wait by the submarine access point, just in case they had to pry Chegar&#39;s tub open to get the two Tenno out.

&quot;Works for me. Going topside means I might be able to check in with Intellectus if the signal&#39;s cleared up by now. Gonna have hell to pay with him, and I don&#39;t need my memories to tell you that. Do any of your Cephalons get on your case like that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Isa drove her sub to let Muro grab onto the attached gun, once he was secure enough on it she drove it back over to the tower.
&quot;Yes, the Grineer outpost will have been quiet for some time now. We should ascend and leave the area before reinforcements arrive if possible, especially given the injuries sustained by the team.&quot; She responds. 

&quot;And no. My cephalon is quite obedient.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Chegar Quietly listened to the banter across the coms. His focus, however, remained on getting the sub to its rendezvous&#39; point. He carefully navigated the vessel into the dock, gently bringing it to a halt as it surfaced.

&quot;Okay...&quot; he began, &quot;time to disembark.&quot; 

With that, he began to unlatch the the hatch, waiting to see if it would fall off it&#39;s mountings considering how much damage the sub had endured.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Nah, my Cephalon is the sweetest thing you&#39;ve seen in this system. She&#39;s a little under the weather right now but when I get her back and working I can show you how awesome a true digital companion can be,&quot; he quipped, entering Isa&#39;s sub.

As he did, Chegar&#39;s sub burst a leak. He chuckled.

........

.

The group of Tenno climbed into the final standing sub and embarked. Disruptis watched out the rear port as the mess they had made of Ikazu&#39;s watery grave faded into the darkness. He mulled over the events he had just been a part of. At first he thought it was something simple as the Grineer poking there knows where they shouldn&#39;t again, but then it devolved into a terrifying reunion. Looking back on it the signs had been there the entire time. He didn&#39;t read too deep into the suspicious circumstances that left him confused and it almost cost him. Even now he felt like he was still missing something. How could such a crazy coincidence occur to bring three groups of individual Tenno together at the same time in the same place? Not including the fourth independent party that arrived before them and kicked off some of this mess. What was happening?

<em>I can feel the ripples.</em>

Singularitis&#39;s final words haunted Disruptis&#39;s thoughts. If he felt there was something big going on, and the Weaver has been ramping up her activity recently... Something was definitely not right. Disruptis fished the button out of his Syandana. It had miraculously survived, as if to remind him that the choice never truly left him.

<em>Sorry, but I&#39;m not really going need you anymore.</em>

He shoved it back in and, with a heart as light as air, returned to the group who was deep in conversation.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="11-Nov-22 08:49 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037488623139954698 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037488623139954698><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 06:09 PM">18:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>[END RP]</strong></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 06:09 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
