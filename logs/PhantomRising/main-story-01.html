At any moment in time, one can bear witness to countless vessels hopping the yawning void of space. They dash from planet to planet carrying cargo and people—though sometimes they are one in the same—with distinct purpose.

One such vessel was found with such purpose on a course to the seventh planet from the Sun.

Out the front viewport of the Birger Transport ship stretched the massive expanse of Uranus’ oceans. Frontier Grineer either set about their tasks aboard the ship or loitered as they waited for landing. Two shorter Grineer sat on a collection of heavy containers filled with mundane supplies in the corner of the ship. The low hum of the ship filled the silence between their ears. Every once in a while, a pipe would give a small hiss or some unseen part of the ship would clank with another. Expected noise, but comforting ambience.

Eventually another Grineer trooper who was meandering about came to sit on a container across from them. He pushed a hand to his neck to alleviate its stiffness if just a little.

In the gutteral Grineer language, he attempted to pass the time with a bit of conversation. “Somethumes Hu get so bregrer. How you two holding up?”</span>

One of the Grineer nods, then reaches up to his throat and rubs at it, as if one of his particular afflictions was damage to his esophagus. To accompany that, his voice is scratchy and low, and thick with the Grineer accents. He clearly doesn’t talk much.

“Nevegr uuser to sgakefdugrt. Ggrefegr ggrouunr. Rategr gdanet suuffuke.”

The other Grineer shook his head and sighed in defeat; leaning forward and resting his elbows against his knees he reached with one hand to adjust his mask&#39;s tubing. The voice was unfiltered, but much like the other Earthling, gravelly and coarse, yet lighter on its accent.

&quot;Hu&#39;m bregrer oot of tu mhunr. Re&#39;s not as klat ekskhutung.&quot; He paused briefly as he looked from his companion back to the visitor. &quot;Ror moohr donger hun flhuvor?&quot;

A series of small nods agreed with his companion&#39;s theory.

&quot;Khul de&#39;srhup tuke klas uun: currs srup oot on danrung. Re cutr rave seyme probdem.&quot; He added while turning to the trooper and pointing at the source of some of the hissing that could be heard near the back of the ship.

{Old ship like this one: cords slip out on landing. We could have same problem.}

&quot;Bat jutr hun kehus.&quot; He added after a brief pause, patting the grakata propped up between his legs with the confidence only someone ready to die can have.

At the sight of the ration, he quickly pat on his own leg pouch feeling through the fabric that his own &#39;ration&#39; was still intact.

~He sat there in silence with them for a couple more moments before he caught something strange out of the corner of his eye. The two disguised Grineer watched as he stood up and approached some sort of commotion in the bridge. It was hard to tell what was being said from their distance, but the Birger Officer was engaged in a tense conversation with the two pilots at the helm. The Officer stood eight feet tall with the typical cybernetic interface covering her left eye. A Karak Wraith sporting a standard issue gray paint job hung on her back.

The Trooper kept a respectable distance from them and leaned against a nearby console, to keep within earshot.~</span>

He didn’t shift from his position on the crate, but he did follow the friendly Trooper’s movement towards the console, then gave a pointed look to his fellow. He didn’t risk speaking, but the intent was clear.

Hopefully they weren’t compromised. He was preferring a quiet insertion. And that Trooper was nice. It’d be a shame to kill him.</span>

Seeing the concern in his companion&#39;s stare, he gave a small nod in return and tapped onto the side of his head, hiding the &quot;listen in&quot; gesture with a scratch of his ear. With that, he stood up and stretched, then grabbed the grakata and carried it in one hand, pointed at the ground, as he got a bit closer to the bridge. Hopefully his presence near the bridge as he followed a few paces after the more experienced Grineer, still rolling his shoulders as if to shrug off the travel stiffness.</span>

The quiet trooper still sat on the crate pushes off of it, moving quickly, but without rushing, to join the attention lines, to show professional diligence and not fear. To show there is nothing to hide.

While leaving the crate did give him a sense of apprehension, he and his fellow had made a point to hide their subterfuge beneath a layer of  prior cargo. And the ace up their sleeve in event of an emergency was always in play.</span>

<em>&quot;A localised dead-comms area? Even if it were kuva research, that&#39;s beyond the usual security measures...&quot;</em>  He though to himself while listening in to the mechanical problems on the bridge.

Snapping out of his relaxed demeanour, the &#39;disguised one&#39; strapped his grakata back onto his belt and fixed the fitting of his helmet while moving into the forming line to stand at attention. He was tiny compared to the others standing beside him, but looked no less the part of a capable and loyal soldier.

He was not quite as used to being on the receiving end of the calls to attention, but he knew what was expected of them. The idea of this being a new experience gave him far more comfort than anxiety, and after all, the plan was progressing flawlessly.</span>

He waited a half second to register the order, and more importantly give time for his group to gather, then he made a point to begin inspecting for signs of more direct sabotage on the ship itself. While he glanced his fellow infiltrator’s way, it was only for a moment. Just acquaintances, saying a silent farewell for now.</span>

Behind the mask, he raised an eyebrow at the commands, but nodded in acknowledgement as they were being dismissed, then gave a second nod to his co-conspirator as they parted ways and joined different units. Personally, he was heading with the maintenance and support unit, hopefully he&#39;d be able to pin-point the source of the issue before anyone thought about going through the cargo.</span>

The Grineer went over their routine maintenance checks, though they were difficult to accomplish while the ship was in flight. The first infiltrator found nothing amiss with regards to direct sabotage on the ship itself amongst his group. The second, who had followed the maintenance and support unit found there was a small issue with some crushed wiring on a panel near the left wing of the ship. Discussing it amongst each other, none of them believed it was the problem at hand because it didn’t seem to connect to comms. Nevertheless, the head technician ordered one of the grunts to grab some supplies from the cargo to fix it just in case. The grunt complied and began moving towards the crate one of the infiltrators had stashed their contraband in.~</span>

Since his checks were clear, he made his way back to the cargo bay, as it was a good central place to regroup, and as he did so, spotted the grunt that could risk compromising their entire operation. Thankfully, he had an idea. He intercepted him at the crate itself, putting a hand on it.

&quot;Klus kagrgo us fogr kle fakuduty ondy, klat ras tu tranrung ogrregr. Rrat rur rear tekr neer? U&#39;dd redg youu funr ut.&quot;

[This cargo is for the facility only, that was my standing order. What did head tech need? I&#39;ll help you find it.]

Technically, he wasn&#39;t lying. He and his associate had picked this crate specifically because it was headed to the base from their &#39;previous&#39; one with orders for it not to be tampered with. But a ship grunt might not know that, so he was trying to point him in the right direction.

Be cooperative, but firm.</span>

A bead of sweat had formed on his forehead as he continued to run down a list of checkups with the head technician, while his eyes clearly followed the grunt threatening to expose them.

<em>&quot;Fantastic interception.&quot;</em> He thought as he stared at his accomplice and relaxed for a brief second, then returned his full attention towards the checklist.

&quot;Huf klus ras not fhuks hut, klen ramash hus eksternar, maybe atmosfhuer entrhu boorn rario reshuver?&quot; He suggested while pointing at the ship schematic, certain that the prospect of having to check the exterior of the ship in it&#39;s current state and trajectory would deter anyone from that course of investigation.

The Trooper nodded in respect to the Lancer as he moved away, then braced himself against the crate as the ship was making final maneuvers. It had been a tense flight, but he felt the slightest tinge of relief that they were so close to actually performing their mission.

Now it was merely a matter of infiltrating a secret, highly guarded base in the middle of nowhere with minimal outside support.

Thinking about it, by this point they really should be used to this kind of thing.</span>

The technician was about to offer another alternative to their communications problem when the ship begun to shake. He grabbed onto the nearest pipe and braced himself until the ship&#39;s flight stabilised within the atmosphere.

There&#39;d been a few close calls, but they were finally arriving at their destination, and with that a step closer to shedding their cover.

The communication errors, however, still gave him the sense something was terribly off; he&#39;d have to check his own network once both of the infiltrators could shift into their combat gear.</span>

Much like the rest of the crew, the newcomer technician heeded the orders, letting go of the piping and tools in hand to instead switch to his grakata, moving towards the back of the line.

All the while, he was searching for his companion to give them a signal and trying to wait for a moment, giving them a chance to line up next to him. From there they should be within the second or maybe third batch to drop, but more importantly it should be far easier to sneak back to the cargo hold and out of the upcoming deployment.</span>

Reluctant to immediately heed the orders, he still began moving towards the line, in particular angling towards the Lancer he&#39;d spoken to previously, meeting him halfway as they rushed to form ranks. He would have to break off as he was not meant for the same line, but at least he could get a word in. His tone sounded desperate. Like his mission was at stake. Which in many ways, technically was not a lie.

If I tried to ask our leader, she would crush me. You are bigger, stronger, smarter. Is there anything you can do to get the cargo offloaded?]

With his plea established, he bowed his head, then broke off and linked up with his fellow, his own Grakata in his hands and at the ready. It might not work, but it was at least worth a try.</span>

The first line dropped into the darkness. Then the second. Then both disguised Grineer dropped with the third line. Their feet hit the pitch-black ferrite platform slick with water from the rain and sea. Waves crashed into the ground beneath their feet, spraying their suits with freshwater mist carried across the surface over strong winds that buffeted their bodies. The slow burning sound of their ship’s engines quietly roared behind them, providing them with enough light to make out dozens of corpses littering the floor. The scent of the sea water mostly overpowered the faint metallic smell of blood. 

Other than the blood smear now washing away, the surface floor of the facility had taken a lot of damage. Various lights, patches of metal plating, and some crates had been broken, dented, scattered, or in some cases even corroded by something. The platform they stood on sprawled out into two more raised platforms and a surface entrance into the facility. The furthest platform held another ship, much like the one they rode in on. The only discernible difference was the complete state of disrepair and corpses strewn across the ramp leading into its darkened, busted remains.

The first line of troops had cleared the platforms and were now investigating the elevators that sat utterly demolished at the bottom of the descent shaft. Without them it was a good 200 meter drop that the Grineer were not willing to attempt yet.~</span>

The impostor grimaced behind his opaque mask. So much for ego boosting. Taking the third line down had him ill at ease, but nonetheless he raised his weapon on landing and moved to watch the angle leading to the elevators, putting his back against a crate to try and deflect some of the intense winds.

He looked to his fellow, hoping he&#39;d follow him, and he was particularly curious about the other ship at the opposite end of their landing zone. Did whatever that had done this arrive with it? Or was the cause something else?

More importantly, what was their next move? If the base was already under assault, what was the point of maintaining their cover any longer? This wasn&#39;t his mission to lead, though, so he waited for input.</span>

While certainly not ideal, their cover was still intact, and whatever laid in wait, it was best for them to assess the situation before discarding their advantage.

He nodded at his companion and approached him, gesturing with his shoulder and gun towards the raised platform holding the broken remains of the sister ship.

&quot;Rut cood cos klat?&quot; He asked as he caught up to them.

{What could cause that?}

Hopefully, once they&#39;d made progress towards it and away from the cluster of their squadron, they could reassess their next steps.</span>

He returned the nod, rising to his feet and looking back towards the ship. It was sitting in the back of his fellow&#39;s mind too. Good. He stuck to his stilted, quiet speech pattern, to maintain his cover in case an errant word was caught by a passerby.

[Was trying to figure that out. Has me nervous for our mission. While the others figure out a way down, let&#39;s go and check it out.]

He motioned for his companion to lead, keeping a careful eye on the trooper that went back towards their own ship in the process. Were they getting a cargo drop after all?</span>

The ghastly wreck of a ship lay at an angle, small amounts of water pouring from its darkened recesses. Two Lancer corpses lay strewn on the tilted landing ramp. One’s skull was bashed in by some powerful blow, and the other was missing his head. The wreckage groaned in the high winds as the imposters made their way inside.

The interior of the ship was much like the outside platform. Plenty of corrosive damage in certain spots near the plethora of corpses that lined the floor, with some spots on the personnel themselves. Burn marks and dented alloy plates conveyed the signs of struggle. Much of the ship’s cargo was strewn across its floors, glinting in the faint ambient light.

It seemed they were somewhat isolated inspecting the wreckage, specially with the other squads handling the emergency elevator setup. It was risky, but they needed to have a talk, reassess their mission priorities and dig into what was going on; and they didn&#39;t have neither the time nor place to do so, but this&#39;d have to do.

As they move inside the ship&#39;s carcass his attention darted from one spot to the next, checking hiding spots cover, even going as far a gently poking some of the corroded corpses; but once the area was indeed secure, he turned to face his co-impostor and tapped his own helmet, signalling before he spoke:

&quot;Does not strike me as Grineer engineering.&quot; He looked around once more, quickly counting the number of bodies strewn about. &quot;With what caused this on the loose, the base will be on high alert, we should be too, but makes the ruse is pointless. Counterpoints?&quot;</span>

He stared at the carnage in somber thought, a shadow of a memory passing through his mind. He’d seen brutality towards Grineer, even enacted it himself, but this felt like it was on another level.

He turned to his conspirator and nodded.

“Only counterpoint that strikes me is that sticking with the pack means first contact will tie up whatever did this with the away team. Then we could hopefully Void out and reinsert from another angle. Counterpoint to <em>that</em> is the ship might leave atmo before we get anywhere close to contact or our actual destination, not to mention whatever is down there might have the capacity to prevent Void-based maneuvering. Unlikely, but I’m not sure I’m willing to take the risk. Up to you in the end, but I’m comfortable breaking cover.”

He rolls his shoulders. “These suits aren’t very well insulated, anyways.”</span>

&quot;All fair points.&quot; He said while looking down at a particularly corroded Grineer corpse. &quot;The safety of the crew comes first, integrity of the mission second.&quot;

He paused to turn back towards his companion, running a quick visual check on their gear. <em>It was garbage</em>. He sighed and shook his head.

&quot;The ship we came in should be nearly empty by now; the security personnel should be on the landing platform. New plan: we leave the gear here and return to the vessels - we take over the ship and crash it into the main gate, from there tunnel out into the main elevator. Odds are suspicion from within the base will be placed on a second case of whatever caused this mess, while the outside forces will be busy dealing with the blockade. We will make our way our of here via the waterways after the main objective is complete. Not as clean as we had hoped, but safety comes first.&quot;

He placed the grakata over his shoulder, uncomfortably shifting his weight on one leg.</span>

He nodded. “Works fine for me. That way we’ll be in the best position to handle whatever went in ahead of us, be they friend or foe.”

He thinks for a minute, then unhooks a hand grenade from his belt.

“To draw attention to this ship right after we Void out? And maybe shred the suits enough that they think we got caught in some unexploded ordinance, if we do it near enough gore that they don’t notice the bodies inside missing.”</span>

He nodded, taking a deep breath as he removed his own helm, feeling the thrumming of Lupin’s Transference energy as he pulled the empty suit nearer to the gore and corpses. He took the extra time to crack the glass of both his and Lupin’s helmets, just in case the grenade didn’t suffice. The more evidence the better.

Then, with his <em>display</em> complete, he stood near to where he predicted the blast would send his own suit, breathed deeply, and then as his own Voidstuff began to fill his body and pull him back towards his Warframe, he pulled the pin of the grenade and set it down, fading into nothingness as he went.

Well. At least they’d gotten this far with the disguises.</span>

Clasped in one armoured hand was the heat dagger he&#39;d opted for instead of the usual hammer due to the size constraints (and in the hopes of using it as a cutting tool, should the need arise), while the other arm was awkwardly bent behind his back and nearly completely detached. Further still from his reach were his side-shotgun and disassembled mag-rifle. While he was certainly short on options, he was far from concerned facing a single confused Grineer.

The insides of the frame, which had been pooling at the bottom of the box for the past few hours of flight, violently animated and burst out and upwards from the inside of the box; his hand guiding the blade at the unfortunate deck worker in unison with the sudden awakening.

It was quick and painless. A sizzling sound marked the end of the poor Grineer as the blade had pierced through their helmet, right between their eyes. Their body, quickly going limp was captured by the cascading dust, the metal arm now behind their back gently letting them down into the box.</span>

His Warframe came into consciousness, and were it not for the body’s natural flexibility and resilience, it would’ve been difficult to resume moving.

If he remembered correctly, his and Lupin’s crates should’ve been near to one another, but they may have shifted in flight. Coiling his legs onto the bottom of the crate, he pressed against the lid, and then once the seal gave, he shoved it clear off and leaped out.

Spotting the Grineer lifting the lid of one crate nearby, he reflexively drew Thumper from his waist with his right, but seeing his cohort emerging from the crate as well, he instead completed his turn and rolled into a crouch on the floor, sweeping the barrel for other targets as he took his sword into his left hand in preparation for the rest of their hijacking.</span>

He didn’t know why the impulse came over him. But in that standoff, his head slowly shifted in a nod, almost out of respect, and then he opened fire. Thumper pulsed as the bolts of plasma erupted from the barrel, earning its namesake, and slamming one in the chest with three hits and down to the ground, his armor and flesh melting away under the heat.

Then, he burst forward, keeping up the barrage as he braced the weapon across his arm, sword at the ready as he closed in for melee. He caught one crewmate like a deer in headlights, sweeping the Pangolin Sword through his waist and bifurcating him, and then ending him with a point blank headshot from the kitgun. Meanwhile, he checked on his and Lupin’s commlink with an afterthought.

“While I clean these up, I’d greatly appreciate if you could take my Latron out of my crate for me. I had to pack it a bit disassembled for the trip.”</span>

With a muted thump, the first Grineer was dumped into the box.

A snap of his shoulder, unnatural in its flexibility, sent the dagger in his hand flying with tremendous speed towards one of the two remaining guards. Whether its aim was true, however, mattered little to him at the moment.

&quot;Copy that.&quot; He responded quite succinctly over the comms, pleased that at least <em>theirs</em> were in working order, as he reached into his box, retrieving his gilded Pyranna from underneath the new occupant.

Strapping the shotgun to his side, he darted over to the other container, rummaging inside to produce the assault rifle&#39;s parts, and adding each to the assembly with mechanical precision. It would still take a moment, but no sooner had the weapon been reassembled he would throw it over to his companion.</span>

The Excalibur briefly withstood the grakata fire, intercepting a few bullets with his fast moving sword, but wasted no time in cutting down the source of fire and sliding into cover. He sheathed both of his weapons and reached up to catch his tossed rifle, turning to then begin picking off Grineer who made the mistake of poking their heads out at him. As he did so, he talked strategy with Lupin over their link.

“Desiccation, maybe? We’d be able to clean this batch up a lot faster if they’re blind. That First Officer will be a pain too with her crew backing her up.”</span>

&quot;That will take too long.&quot; His response came over the link far too late, as he was already dashing and sliding past Dominus&#39; cover, sidearm in hand; the brunt of the low calibre barrage would fall on him, with the quick manoeuvre earning him but a second of poor accuracy on the enemy&#39;s part.

<em>KLIKT-THUMP</em> - Cover could only protect them from afar; the shotgun reaching over the crates scattered the first Grineer&#39;s upper torso across the floor. He vaulted over and took their place as his aim pushed further down.

<em>THUMP</em> - The rear line blocking the path towards the pilot cabin was next, their body pelted with near a dozen shards cutting shallow at this distance, yet leaving the First Officer with a defence line in disarray. His cover was nearly useless here, but at least that&#39;d leave Dominus a clear path in.</span>

“Wish the feeling was mutual...”

The Excalibur mumbled from behind his own cover, then slipped into the mess of crates to work his way further up the line, trying to draw the fire off of Lupin by sending a few rounds down towards the Birger Officer, taking advantage of her open stance. Meanwhile he kept talking shop with his comrade.

“I can kill pretty much any of them if I can get in tight with the Pangolin Sword, the trouble is just getting there in the first place.”</span>

&quot;In that case: go for the officer.&quot; He called back over comms as he focused on the dust pouring out of him.

&quot;Get ready to move, in 3, 2...&quot; Before the count was done, he leapt from his cover towards the Officer&#39;s left, behind him a dull golden cloud dragged in after his hand. With a whip of his arm the cloud was violently flung in a blinding arc at the heavy gunner.

&quot;Apologies, but I have no recollection of you, Officer.&quot; He said clear and loud in a tone that betrayed no hostility, as the animated sand worked its way to blind and corrode them.</span>

Having been thrown back under cover from the ripping fire, the Excalibur holstered his rifle and changed back to his blade, throwing himself over the crate immediately after the Dessication wave and bullet jumping towards the officer.

Deciding not to risk a glancing blow on her armor immediately, he aimed to damage the middle section of the Gorgon, to hamper its firing, and then brought the sword back up and towards the officer’s neck, in an attempt to not only end her immediate threat, but break the morale of the remaining crew.</span>

The moment the blade connected with the officer, he knew there was no way for him to keep the aims on him. That didn&#39;t mean he couldn&#39;t protect Dominus, though. With reckless abandon he broke into a bullet jump directly towards the Excalibur, tackling him into the now open path and sliding into the cockpit. No sooner had they cross the threshold, he spun and kicked his companion aside, causing both to slide away from each other and out of line of fire.

&quot;Get the pilot, I will handle the door.&quot; <em>Despite saying that, he was starting to slow down, having lost a non-trivial amount of the substance that replaced most of this body&#39;s innards.

As he felt the bullets shatter his shield and impact into his back, he was just in the belabored process of turning to try and engage the pocket of remaining Grineer when Lupin sent him flying with his tackle, and then careening against the wall. Momentarily stunned, he nonetheless got back to his feet rapidly and adjusted, limping slightly but still heading for the pilot’s seat to forcibly hijack and take control from the occupant.

With the cockpit underl lockdown, they now had a moment to reassess their actions. He picked up the severed Officer&#39;s head with one hand as he inspected his shot-pistol with the other.

&quot;Back to work little ones.&quot; He whispered in a glimpse of Shakesperean dramatics, pulling the proliferating cursed sand back into his body. It wasn&#39;t much, but every bit counted, specially when so much had gone off plan so early on.

While he was unfamiliar with this ship&#39;s layout, Grineer spacecraft infrastructure rarely veered from the true and tested methods.

&quot;Once you are done, check the reactor&#39;s integrity.&quot; He hinted at over comms as he positioned himself dead-center in front of the bulkhead, Pyranna aimed head-high to greet the poor unfortunate bastard that would be sent to breach, his free hand holding onto the lever to add insult to injury.</span>

He almost felt bad as he approached the pilot. She was just doing her job. They all were, really. But that job was in direct conflict to his own, and he had no way of knowing exactly what was happening down below. It could be anything so heinous it required secrecy. And his job today was to root out the heinous. He laid a heavy hand onto the primary controls alongside the pilot, and as he plunged his sword into her heart from the side, he spoke calmly.

While he&#39;d tried to be swift and somewhat respectful in the slaying itself, he couldn&#39;t afford to be kind the rest of the way. With a shove he got the pilot&#39;s body out of her seat and went for the controls to try and level the ship back into place, bracing his feet against whatever was nearby if the angle got too aggressive. In the back of his mind he made a note to thank Intellectus&#39;s paranoia for forcing him to get a passing understanding of most ship types in the system when he heard about the mission.

&quot;Are we still sticking to the &#39;ram it into the entrance and hope for the best&#39; plan? Did you want me to try and dump out our remaining passengers first, or at the very least throw them for a loop? I might be able to get this to roll.&quot;</span>

Luckily, he already had his hand on the lever, which promply became his sole anchor point when the ship dove down. Surely the bulkhead would open halfway as his weight pulled the lever part of the way up.

The position was incredibly awkward, but it was oddly advantageous - should the guards fall on or approach the entrance, they&#39;d now be wide open to his gunfire. With that in mind, he held on tightly to the lever, pulling himself up until one leg touched the wall (now pseudo ceiling) and he could lock himself in place.

&quot;Just ram it, and then lock the controls to maximum thrust forward - it should cause the thrusters to overheat in a few minutes.&quot; He replied while trying to adjust and match the ship&#39;s movements.</span>

Both Tenno braced as the landing pad zoomed up to them in the blink of an eye and punched in the front of the vessel. <em>CRUNCH.</em> Two Grineer fell through the crack in the partially opened doorway from the sheer force of the impact and shattered the viewport, disappearing when the ship flipped over and tumbled across the pad. Everything inside it was tossed around with enough force to crack a skull or two.

The rolling stopped when the nose of the ship jammed upside-down into the side of the entranceway, since the ship had been keeping tabs on that direction. It crushed four Grineer troops stationed inside along the way, not to mention everyone who had been outside on the platform. Three remaining Grineer flanking the elevators further in just about leaped out of their skin.~</span>

He didn&#39;t know what reflex had come up with the idea to additionally brace himself by lodging his sword into the hull and essentially planting his feet and arms into a corner of the cockpit in a spider-like pose. Maybe it was an ingrained trick of Tenno acrobatics. Or maybe some latent memory of his had come up with the idea.

For some reason he could vaguely remember being in a crash similar to this one, and he was ill-willing to repeat history given that anything could have triggered his amnesia. He didn&#39;t want <em>more</em> trauma to have to deal with. In any case, once they had settled into place, for better or for worse, he braved his communicator, not daring to move too much for fear of losing his grip and somehow managing to plummet into the elevator shafts.

&quot;...Lupin. Please tell me you&#39;re alright. And next time we do a job like this, let&#39;s try for an underwater insertion. I&#39;ve decided I hate infiltration. Let me know when you feel comfortable to move. My nanites are still on deck.&quot;</span>

<em>&quot;This has gone as poorly as it could possibly have.&quot;</em> He thought to himself as he looked down and out the window, waiting to time his fall. <em>&quot;Well, at least there are no Sentient...&quot;</em> He winced at the thought of having jinxed them further, just as he let go, falling less than second after the two unfortunate souls who&#39;d soon become paste on the platform.

Mid-air, he spun himself around, using the momentum of his fall and spin to catapult his Parazon against the now-empty pilot&#39;s chair; he would&#39;ve soon joined the floored lancers had he not yanked himself to break his momentum. The pendulum effect carried him with great force against the floor-turned-wall as it spun around him, he stumbled as he continued to pull himself towards the chair, running and jumping against the chaotic environment - it was like trying to survive living inside a Rubix cube being solved by a very angry cephalon.

&quot;Yeah... just barely.&quot; He finally responded exhausted as he was being furiously spun by the parazon&#39;s cable unwinding from the endeavour as it extended to its full length and dropped him to ground level. &quot;I need to replenish my nanites though - we might have a second or two before they approach the crash.&quot; His shoulder popped back into place as he said that, the unusual anatomy of his avatar trying its best to remain in one piece despite the plentiful leaks on its chest and sides.</span>

&quot;Never-&quot; The parazon quickly clicked shut and with a tug was dislodged as the Inaros dropped to his knees and leapt down towards the assailant. &quot;-mind&quot;

<strong>KLIKT-THUMP</strong> The Pyrana went off at near point-blank range, as he&#39;d flown a solid 5 meters directly towards them, right above their line of fire. Their body didn&#39;t have time to touch the ground however. In the same swift movement, he caught the husk by the shoulder pad and transferred his momentum with a vault, catapulting them towards one of the staggered onlookers, pinning them under the weight of their own companion&#39;s corpse.

<em>KLIKT-THUMP</em>  He shot again, this time at the standing onlooker. <em>KLIKT-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP</em>  The still-standing Grineer was quickly turned into a pincushion as the gun unloaded barrage after barrage of pellets upon them.

&quot;Inside. Now.&quot; He called back over comms, taking the briefest moment to reload his gun while he walked towards the singled-out Grineer.

<em>tink tink thunk tink</em> He recoiled as the pinned and now panicking Grineer started shooting from their position instead of trying to free themselves.

&quot;Void damnit!&quot; It wasn&#39;t rage, but rather frustration that was palpable in his voice, as he started sprinting towards the nearest corpse grabbing them on their way into the elevator area.</span>

The Excalibur dropped not long after Lupin, grabbing the underside of what remained of the ship&#39;s front-facing window on his way down to vault out towards the walls, using his prior idea of sword-based braking to effectively drag a long, jagged line down the side of the shaft they were in to the ground. He watched as Lupin engaged the hostiles on the ground floor in the meantime, and, spotting the last Grineer still doggedly firing at his companion, pushed off of the wall at a (reasonably) safe height to plummet towards the pinned trooper and plunge the Pangolin Sword through him.

With that handled, and his fall conveniently broken by the act, he pried his blade free with a wet, sucking noise and followed the Inaros closely, reaching to the small of his back to remove a metal pod, holding it between the two of them as he activated the repair process.

&quot;Healing pad&#39;s up. It&#39;ll take time, especially working with your frame&#39;s tough skin, but this&#39;ll take the edge off. How&#39;s your energy? My shields are still cooling.&quot;</span>

&quot;Thank you.&quot; He spoke drily as he slowed down as his companion had cleared the room. While inspecting the wounds on his carapace he took to a knee, absorbing the healing effects of the deployable.  The cursed sand that seeped from his body slowly dragging across the floor and rolling over the bodies to rejoin with its host. &quot;It looks worse than it is, as soon as the cracks stop leaking, it should be enough to keep me going.&quot;

&quot;I can still spare the energy.&quot; He added, clipping the gun to his side, and dropping the corpse he&#39;d had half the intention to pick clean. &quot;But it looks like someone other than the Grineer was here.&quot; He added with growing intrigue and concern, pointing at the rope. &quot;A Tenno most likely, given the damage inside the crew ship, though an operative with them is likely.&quot; Had there not been a break in, the elevators would be up by now, or a semi-permanent zip-line would be in place.

No sooner he&#39;d stopped &#39;bleeding&#39; he got back on his feet, not quite moving yet, but certainly giving off the intention to do so. &quot;Get as much healing as we can, we will most definitely be facing full alert resistance from here on out.&quot;</span>

He rolled his neck as they slowly repaired what damage could be fixed in the field, finally taking the time to reload his weapons.

“I regret not bringing my Carrier for additional support, but with the resistance we’ve had so far, it would’ve gotten shot down quickly.”

He followed his gaze to the rope down, mind wandering to the carnage a full-frontal assault might&#39;ve merited. Especially if they&#39;d brought a full complement of four Warframes to the party. But even he thought that was overkill.

“That’s assuming there’s much left to resist us, but I agree.”</span>

&quot;Likewise, I would not mind having my pet with me, but we will have to make do.&quot; He added in a relaxed tone, letting a few more moments linger.

&quot;Right, I think that will do for healing on my end.&quot; He segwayed. &quot;I will be heading down now, give me some back up from higher ground.&quot; He added, already heading towards the rope, checking its anchor point before pirouetting over the ledge and starting his rappel down.</span>

&quot;Aye aye. I&#39;ll follow on your word.&quot;

The Excalibur deactivated the healing pad manually and replaced it at his back (to recycle it, mostly) before making his way to the edge of the shaft near the rope and almost casually sitting against the wall to brace his recoil, and aiming his Latron down towards the bottom, watching Lupin descend from the corner of his eye.

He swept the barrel slowly across his view, waiting for any unfamiliar movement to make itself known.</span>

He reached the bottom to see more destruction, before the room stretched out in one hall leading to another elevator shaft that was in very much the same state as the one they had just climbed down. This included another rope inviting them to climb further downward. Dominus joined him when it was clear, and the two began to descend into the ravaged facility.~</span>

~Lupin and Dominus carefully investigated the underwater Grineer sealab. Corpses were strewn across the floors every so while, and all equipment they had was either shattered or missing entirely. Some of the haunted corridors were shut entirely due to an environment breach, sealing whatever watery grave now lay beyond. Eventually they found themselves walking down a hallway until they both heard some shuffling in an unchecked room to their right before the bend path~.</span>

As they&#39;d entered the hallways of the facility proper, Dominus had switched back to his musketeer style pistol+sword combination, since maneuvering his Latron effectively in close quarters would be a nuisance more than anything else. As they heard the shuffling of the unchecked room, he silently treaded to the side of the door and nodded his head towards it, weapons at the ready.

Whatever they were following down here, he wanted to identify it fast. And if necessary inflict gratuitous violence upon it. The same applied to what might be inside.</span>

Either by chance, or simply by the laws of cohesion, the two were nearly matching in style of weaponry, and strangely well coordinated for their first mission together. In a stance reminiscent of ancient enforcers and assassins, he carried his dagger with a reversed grip underneath his gun hand, providing him both stability for a shot and quickest access to his blade.

Once Dominus had moved into position, and having done the same on the other side of the opening, he nodded and silently gestured the count of three. On one, he bounced away from the wall to turn, kneel and slide into the room, activating his flashlight in the process.</span>

Standing amongst them however was a singular trooper, which the pair recognized as a member of the squad they had infiltrated. Upon the light hitting his face, the trooper looked up from the body he was searching, his fearful expression slowly morphing to one of abject terror as his eyes adjusted and he recognized the shape of a Warframe before him.

&quot;Kweens, no!&quot; he yelled. The trooper fumbled for his weapon, hands visibly shaking as he raised his gun to Lupin. He barely had time to aim it before a loud slam sounded far behind him, accompanied by a cerulean tendril lashing out from the darkness and snatching the trooper, who started screaming unintelligibly as he was dragged off beyond the range of Lupin&#39;s light.

Though no longer visible, Lupin and Keli could still hear the frenzied wails of the trooper, but with an audible crunch, his cries began to sound more gargled. Another crunch, followed by a final-sounding squelch, and the trooper fell silent.

The sound of heavy footfalls began to fill the still air. Step by step, a tall figure emerged from the darkness. Lupin&#39;s light revealed it to be a Hydroid Prime model Warframe, with a crude looking zaw hanging from its hand.~

<strong>???:</strong>
&quot;Was wondering where that one came from,&quot; the frame croaked, shielding what would have passed for eyes on the frame&#39;s head with their other arm, &quot;hey, kill the light would you?&quot;</span>

Max grimaced as far as a faceless frame like Excalibur could, having walked into the room behind Lupin once he had swept his flashlight across the trooper and then the mysterious Hydroid. He felt a touch on edge at the sight of them, but kept his own weapons low, and his light off. He wanted answers more than anything else right now.

&quot;I had a feeling we were either dealing with another Warframe, or some other particularly ambitious and aggressive individual ripping and tearing their way through this facility. How goes, friend? Callsign&#39;s Dominus, if you have a name yourself. What brings you here?&quot;</span>

He&#39;d kept the gun trained on the Grineer&#39;s last seen location until the Hydroid finally emerged. With a sigh of relief, he lowered the weapon and turned the light off at the other Tenno&#39;s behest.

He gave them a quick two-fingered wave with his dagger hand as he stood back up, moving aside so the three could converse inside the room more comfortably.</span>

&quot;Appreciate it. How I&#39;m doing depends on whether these wastes of protein managed to call for help before I got&#39;em,&quot; the Hydroid replied with audible disdain as it motioned back towards where he had left the last trooper. 

&quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting to run into reinforcements so soon, but as long as they&#39;re dead, that&#39;s all that matters. Say...&quot; the pair could almost feel a pair of unseen eyes, quickly scanning the both of them, &quot;you&#39;re asking me how I am, but that patch job on your frames makes you two look like you were on the wrong end of a flak cannon. What happened to you?&quot;</span>

The Excalibur looked down at itself, then back up to the Hydroid, before shrugging noncommittally. Really, when <em>wasn&#39;t</em> your average Warframe on the wrong side of a gun?

&quot;Insert went a bit awry, what can I say? We didn&#39;t get iced, and we&#39;re as close to 100% as you can get in the field without some sort of self-repair system. Initially we were going to try and do this quiet, just to figure out what was going down. That changed once we saw the carnage topside. Presumably your handiwork? Or do you have a team rolling with you?&quot;</span>

&quot;Funny, I was <em>just</em> about to ask him the same thing. <em>Again.</em>&quot;

Flickering green light emanated from the chamber entrance. Standing before them was <em>another</em> warframe, a black-clad Nova Prime wreathed in a luminous mist that constantly boiled off its chassis. One hand held onto a datamass, the other an ornate machine pistol; though not pointed at anyone for now, the warframe&#39;s finger was resting on the trigger. The blank faceplate turned to the Hydroid, somehow conveying a glare with an utterly expressionless face.

&quot;&#39;Haven&#39;t worked with a squad in a long time&#39;, was it? Then I suppose <em>these</em>-&quot; she gestured at the new arrivals, &quot;-marked quite a turning point for you.&quot;</span>

The Hydroid cast a glance over his shoulder, eyeing the irate Nova. 

&quot;Cool it Nova,&quot; He replied curtly, &quot;they&#39;re not with me, and it sounds like they&#39;re not your crew either. Saves me the trouble of asking.&quot; 

He turned sideways a bit, allowing himself to face both parties of interlopers. &quot;You can put that pistol away too while you&#39;re at it. The only things here that would be scared of that peashooter are already dead.”

The Hydroid returned his attention back to the new pair. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t know why you two are here, and unless you&#39;re on the Grineer payroll I don&#39;t really care. Loot the place if you like, I won&#39;t stop you. You&#39;re out of luck if you&#39;re here for intel though. There aren&#39;t any working consoles left on these levels. Now...&quot;

The frame cast its eyes about the room, before locking onto a small stack of red-orange barrels in a corner labelled with the typical Grineer ‘DEATH IS NEXT’ label, betraying its nature as an explosive barrel.

&quot;There they are. Nova, grab a barrel.&quot; 

The Hydroid strode over to the stack, taking a barrel under each arm. With payload in hand, he started walking back towards the darkened halls of the base, before pausing to address the pair again.

&quot;Oh, word of warning. I already told the Nova this, but if I were you I wouldn&#39;t hang around too long. At some point someone&#39;s going to come check on this place, and unless you want to fight an army, I&#39;d suggest you be long gone before that happens.&quot;</span>

He was staring at the Nova. Something seemed familiar. The frame, the voice, hell, even the attitude seemed to strike a chord. He couldn&#39;t place why, but she felt like someone that he should know already. The Hydroid had mentioned fighting an army...Then it clicked. Maybe he couldn&#39;t remember her, but she might remember <em>him</em>.

The Excalibur voiced his concerns, suddenly hoping beyond hope he was finally running into someone who could help with his memories, even in a small way.

&quot;Wait. Before you both run off. Nova, er, whatever your name or callsign might be. I apologize if this seems strange, but have we met before? Usually my memory is fairly good, but everything prior to waking up, I can never recall. But I feel like I should recognize you.&quot;</span>

Since the Hydroid had made their entrance, he&#39;d been a bystander, letting Dominus be the face of their squad and establish a link with the others. At the mention of memories, however, he perked up and looked between the Nova Prime and Excalibur.

&quot;Probably best you two talk in private about that - preferably off the field for that matter.&quot; He cut in, before he walked past them to grab yet another of the barrels and following after the Hydroid. &quot;I need more information about this place, so I better check that our mystery sailor does not sink our boat quite yet.&quot;

He lingered there, politely waiting for the other two to follow or nod in acknowledgement of his planned exit from the conversation at that point.</span>

The Nova&#39;s posture was rigid and tense, her gaze locked on the Excalibur. Knuckles tightening on the akstiletto. At Lupin&#39;s words however her head jerked toward the Inaros.

&quot;...Quite. Neither the time nor the place.&quot; She tapped the side of her helmet. &quot;Would you be so good as to open your comms? There&#39;s someone else who&#39;d like to make your acquaintance.&quot;

With that she stalked out the room after the Hydroid, pointedly ignoring the stack of explosive barrels.</span>

The Hydroid shook his head at the back and forth, but noted that at least someone besides his alleged partner was offering to help. 

&quot;Already told you Cephalon,&quot; he said over comms, &quot;I only need a small opening, and it looks like your friend&#39;s firepower alone isn&#39;t going to cut it. Plus, that door&#39;s the only way in or out of that level. Wouldn&#39;t be bothering with it otherwise.&quot; 

Briefly, the Hydroid looked over towards Lupin. &quot;If you and your friend want to help, that&#39;s fine by me. Many hands and all that.&quot; 

Adjusting his grip on one of the barrels, he continued his trek back towards the door, implicitly directing the pair to follow.</span>

Stifled. But her hesitance and the dodging of the question told him enough. She <em>did</em> know something about who he was. And he would have answers. But first he had to cooperate. And they were all making valid points, honestly.

He tapped the side of his helm as he approached the barrels, grabbing an extra and setting his communications array. While it was going to take a few moments more before Intellectus noticed them linking back up, the least he could do was follow the instruction, for whoever else was listening. He was close behind Lupin and the Hydroid when he spoke again.

&quot;Well, at least now we&#39;re unlikely to get ourselves wrecked down here with a full complement of Warframes. Unlikely, being the operative term.&quot;</span>

&quot;Quite. In any case, we have a little time gentlemen; how about a crash course in demolitions?&quot;

The Nova weaved around the impromptu squad, placing herself alongside the tall Hydroid while walking backwards to face the other two. 

&quot;Selecting the right tool for the task at hand is <em>paramount;</em> simply taking whichever explosive is closest to hand and hoping for the best is the recourse of the foolish, desperate, or suicidal. So!&quot;

Twin metallic <em>pings</em> echoed off the corridors as the warframe snapped its fingers. &quot;Let us say we were trying to blast a bore through an <em>extremely</em> heavy duty vault door. Given the thickness and strength of the barrier, this would require a <em>penetrating</em> device: high explosive breaching charges, anti-armour weaponry, <em><strong>antimatter,</strong></em> or if we&#39;re really strapped for options a mining laser. What we&#39;re <em>bringing</em>, however-&quot; She rapped her knuckles on the canister held in the Hydroid&#39;s arms, &quot;-are a few barrels of detonite if we&#39;re lucky, distilled grokdrul if not. Low yield. Not even shaped.&quot; She looked pointedly at her &#39;partner&#39;.  &quot;All <em>this</em> will serve is to spit fire and shrapnel around the room while I work. If you wish to help me get us through that door, you need to bring something <em>FOCUSED.</em>&quot;

She turned back to the pair. &quot;Oh, and would a second Zenurik adherent be too much to hope for? This will need quite some power regardless.&quot;</span>

&quot;From the sounds of it, you have tried antimatter already.&quot; He tacked on at the end of the Nova&#39;s extensive explanation. &quot;By your own admission, single blast was insufficient - and simply going at it without guarantee of success could turn out to be a foolish waste of resources. So why not change the approach? We need the bulkhead out of the way, not necessarily destroyed - if you get rid of the locking mechanism, we might be able to force it open with the four of us.&quot;

He finally tapped the side of his head with the back of his gun, gesturing to open his own comms channel. All the while he following after the Hydroid, and now Nova, at the head of the squad.</span>

&quot;Are you deaf, Cephalon?&quot; The Hydroid said wearily. &quot;Or do you just like to hear yourself talk? I just told you I tried to find another way in from the outside. <em>There aren&#39;t any.</em> If there were a simpler way inside we wouldn&#39;t be talking right now.&quot; 

He shifted one of the barrels again as he trudged forward, halfheartedly nodding along to the Nova&#39;s scolding. 

&quot;Two things Nova. First, these barrels pack quite a bit more punch than you&#39;d think. Found that out the hard way. Second, if anti-matter is so useful here, why&#39;d you decide to waste time following me around instead of trying to breach the door? I told you this already, but since you and your glass-headed partner seem to be hard of hearing, I&#39;ll say it again: all I need you to do is make a small hole in the door. I don&#39;t care how its done.&quot; 

The Hydroid grumbled audibly before pressing onward, lengthening his stride as they drew closer to the door.</span>

Another day to be grateful for his Warframe&#39;s expressionless head. He was torn between frowning at the bickering or smirking. Hearing the new Cephalon&#39;s voice in his head, he responded to the open air and along his network.

&quot;My companion and I came here to investigate the Grineer&#39;s operations and hopefully disrupt them. Initially we were going to try and do things quietly through an insertion using some Steel Meridian made Grineer suits, but after we saw the carnage we scrubbed that plan and went loud.&quot;

Max felt more than heard Intellectus also slip into his mind, but his personal Cephalon kept quiet for the moment as he did some cursory scans of his fellow Warframes and his own colleague, before starting cursory mapping protocols.

&quot;If you liked, I could see about trying to carve a gap in the door with my blade before we resort to extreme explosives. And I apologize, Nova, I hold towards Naramon and Vazarin as my schools. An Excalibur&#39;s energy usually doesn&#39;t deplete particularly fast if he&#39;s smart with using it.&quot;</span>

The sooner they could get this door open, the sooner all this needless bickering could come to an end.

&quot;Unfortunately our plan of entry did not allow for large explosives or anti-bunker weaponry.&quot; He added to the Excalibur&#39;s explanation. &quot;Which means: we will have to make do with what we have, as Hydroid so eloquently pointed out.&quot;

&quot;So, since you seem to know what these barrels have been loaded with, Hydroid: where to?&quot; He finished up tapping the side of the barrel with his gun.</span>

&quot;The door&#39;s nearby,&quot; the Hydroid informed them, &quot;just around this corner here.&quot; 

The team had returned to heavy door, which now bore the scars of both the Nova&#39; and the Hydroid&#39;s attempts at entry. He gently placed the barrels up against the door, taking several steps back after doing so. 

&quot;Sounds like we all get what we want if this place is destroyed. Set the barrels up, then let&#39;s see how sturdy this door is.&quot; The Hydroid retreated a fair distance away from the door, pulling a grataka off his hip as he reached the door on the opposing side of the room that lead back out into the hallway. &quot;Find cover. You don&#39;t want to be within a direct line of them.&quot;</span>

The Excalibur set down the extra barrel and turned away for cover, taking position behind the corner of a distant wall and pulling his Latron off his back at rest, to turn the corner and aim once the explosion was set off. In the meantime, his Cephalon engaged Karsk, his scans and situational update complete.

<span class="pre pre--inline">My Master and his associate were given the location of this base due to reports of Vay Hek and Tyl Regor attempting a new cloning process, and thus were sent to gather information and disrupt the proceedings.

Max was busy keeping his gaze affixed to the Nova, even as he kept his actual head from moving. Much as he wanted answers, he didn&#39;t want any antimatter-charged bullets flying around if she got particularly incensed, so if she went off the handle, they&#39;d have to bring her back down to earth fast.

&quot;Are we expecting anything inside? I know you&#39;ve cleared out most of this region, but I imagine they&#39;d have plenty of bodies guarding whatever&#39;s past this heavy of a defensive chokepoint.&quot;</span>

Yet another barrel was placed before the door, squeezed tight with the other two as the Inaros made sure the barrels were secured. With a shoulder roll and a quick glance at the setup, he finally gave a nod and jogged back towards the group, giving the Hydroid a quick nod and a &quot;Good to go.&quot;

He took cover beside Dominus, kneeling and pressing his body against the wall, his synthetic muscles tensed up as he readied himself for the chaos of an explosion and the subsequent guards that would come.

&quot;And to append to that.&quot; He added after Dominus&#39; tactical question. &quot;Do you have a backup plan, should we need to lock the location down, but are unable to get to the cargo?&quot;</span>

&quot;I don&#39;t care about the cargo,&quot; the Hydroid stated bluntly, &quot;My plan is simple. Step one: kill every living thing on the other side of that door. Step two: Destroy all network infrastructure. Step three: flood the base and extract.&quot; 

He slowly checked the weapon in his hand as he rattled off his objectives. 

&quot;Total extermination mission. Nothing left usable, and no witnesses. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s on the other side of that door, but with our current numbers, its nothing we can&#39;t handle...&quot; the Hydroid paused, seeming to think about something for a moment.

The Nova rolled her eyes.

“You better hope this works,” she replied flatly. She wove her hands in an arc in front of her, radiant green energy burning from her hands. She brought them together with clawed fingers until a vivid green ball of swirling antimatter pooled between them.

“You will want to focus as much force or firepower onto this orb as possible for the most optimal effect. It feeds on all types of energy.”

With that, she released the slow moving sphere of dizzying energy to the other end of the room.</span>

&quot;Aye aye.&quot; Was his response as he began laying fire into the orb, unloading a full clip, since his Latron had the benefit of being able to carry obscene amounts of extra ammunition. &quot;While I&#39;d like to know more, a three-step plan isn&#39;t a terrible one.&quot;</span>

&quot;I can spare a couple clips.&quot; He said quickly before turning the Pyrana onto the orb, synching up with the Latron&#39;s own fire so as to leave little room for crossfire. A full clip would go by in a flash, with another swiftly being slotted in.</span>

The barrels burst with their own yellow-orange cumbustion that blew up so hard it made the entire corridor shake. The fiery blast surged from the room and into the hallway, bathing the Nova as she desperately summoned her own Null Stars to shield herself. All three Tenno around the bend felt scalding hot air singe their warframes’ sword steel carapaces and blast throughout the rest of the floor.

Once the explosions subsided, a very energy-depleted Nova stood in front of a bulkhead door with a massive dent in its face. They had succeeded, but only in creating a small gap between the warped metal of the two sides of the door about fifteen centimeters wide.~</span>

Once the worst was past, Max rounded the corner and advanced slowly on the door, keeping his freshly-reloaded Latron&#39;s barrel pointed directly at the opening.

&quot;I can either see if I can cut us a bit more of a gap, or we can try and pull it apart. Thoughts?&quot;

As he came closer to the door, he pulled off slightly to the right and closer to the connecting wall, dropping to a knee. Just in case some sort of colossal behemoth burst through and tried to trample all of them. Then he could react accordingly.</span>

The Hydroid strode past the others, his gaze unerringly fixed on the new breach on the door. 

&quot;Strangers is fine with me,&quot; the Hydroid remarked brusquely, holstering his Grataka as he melted into a pool of liquid on the floor. With an audible splash, the puddle of void-infused water arched upwards from the floor and through the hole in the door. 

~A couple moments passed.

Then, the door groaned as its dented frame attempted to retract into both walls. A large cranking noise accompanied its multilayered retreat, until it pulled open to reveal a reconstituted Hydroid holding down a giant lever attached to the side of a small hallway that abruptly ended in a single elevator. The exit ahead wasn’t the typical Grineer double-shaft meant for hauling both ways at once. As such, there was no way to know what lay below without descending into it.~</span>

&quot;Good work, Hydroid.&quot; He nodded at the Hydroid as he followed through the now-open corridor. His comms were left silent as all that needed to be said for introductions had been covered at this moment.

&quot;We have lost enough time with the door, so we better hurry on through.&quot; He added as he quickened his pace on the way over to the elevator, ready to check the console if none beat him to it. The sooner they could make it to the bottom of this lab, the better.</span>

“Well that’s a little rude,” the Nova commented, watching the door open, “I am Narakis. I don’t quite know what the deal is with our Hydroid friend here but--”

Narakis straightened up as a loud alert came in through her HUD. She quickly pulled open its message to see what was up.

She didn’t like what she found.

“Ah… that is most tragic. Well, I have completed my end of the deal in escorting the cephalon inside. Cephalon Karsk, I shall leave it to you from here. I have business I must attend to.”

With that, Narakis moved back into the hallway into the direction she came into the facility from. She turned back for a second and locked eyes with Dominus.

He&#39;d forgotten the Hydroid&#39;s plan, he could admit to that. As the door opened, he stood and was about to round his way inside, when he was passed by the Nova. Narakis. He knew that name. It wasn&#39;t a callsign. It <em>was</em> her name. But where had he heard it before?

Nonetheless, he nodded to her. &quot;Understood, and be safe out there. I can&#39;t ask questions of the dead. Feel free to leave whatever the Cephalon&#39;s using as a vessel in a pod in orbit, I&#39;ll have my Orbiter come around to pick it up.&quot;

He would take Karsk&#39;s current home off of her, switching back to Thumper and joining the other two inside the elevator shaft, silent as he approaches. He suddenly had a fair bit on his mind to accompany this mission.</span>

“I appreciate it…” Narakis turned on her heel and stalked around the corner, pausing one last time without turning.

“...Don’t forget to give me a call.”

With that, the Nova’s footsteps retreated down the corridors.

<strong>Hydroid:</strong>
The Hydroid barely seemed to notice the Nova&#39;s departure as he quietly took his place in the elevator, hoisting the shotgun off his back and staring ahead, waiting for one of his new squadmates to start the elevator.</span>

s’ own technocytic bones. The elevator grinded downwards, pulling them from the warm but sparse graces of the emergency lighting and plunging them into colder darkness. 

They descended for two minutes before the haunting drone of distant alarms could be heard from beneath. The elevator slowed, then cranked to a stop in the dark. 

Two large doors swung open in front of the Tenno, revealing a big room bathed in the pulsing red light of wall-mounted alarms. Four rows of consoles and other computer equipment dominated the room with a large hologram centered in the middle that displayed the yellow-orange projection of a typical Grineer soldier.

A single wide corridor led out of the room and around a bend to the rest of the floor.~</span>

The Excalibur stepped out first, sweeping his pistol along the field of view that the room offered, making his way to the most prominent set of consoles and kneeling down to plug in Karsk&#39;s datamass. Once that was completed, he turned back to his companions, drawing his blade with his now free hand and holding his ground.

In tow to his companion, the Inaros flowed out of the elevator, sidearm in hand as they secured the room, then moved towards the threshold of the corridor, watching as Dominus hacked into the rudimentary system.

&quot;I do not want to get another of those reinforced bulkheads separating us - we can move together once the Cephalon is done.&quot; He explained while taking stock of the ammo in his gun and reserve (though &#39;we&#39; was still not quite well defined).</span>

The glowing orange image of a Grineer soldier sprang into view, though something was off about him. His right arm and legs were made with assimilated Sentient material.

He felt more than heard Intellectus taking pictures of the amalgamation through his optics, but after a moment of mentally processing just what it was he was looking at, Max got his senses back in order.

&quot;Grineer are overstepping the bounds of sanity. We need to move fast and brick this place as much as possible. Where&#39;s the next floor? Let&#39;s get under way, and then we can destroy everything on our way back out, if we can&#39;t find some other form of self-destruction.&quot;</span>

There were 3 subfloors to this level including the one they were on, with each room largely dedicated to some sort of manufacturing process or experimentation by look of their labels. It would take a while to destroy all twenty-one rooms. The largest room in the center was labelled “Completed Prototypes”.~

<strong>Hydroid:</strong>
With the room appearing clear of any prying eyes, the Hydroid turned his attention to the abomination of a grineer that was on display. 

&quot;Idiots,&quot; he snorted. &quot;About what I&#39;d expect from the Grineer&#39;s best and brightest though.&quot; 

Striding towards the nearest console, he accessed the map being offered, taking careful note of the general layout of this floor. 

&quot;Glad to hear we&#39;re all on the same page now,&quot; he remarked, &quot;we stick with the first part of my plan: search this place from top to bottom, one floor at a time, and kill everything we find. Once we&#39;ve done that, we wreck everything else on the way back up. Cephalon, see if you can lock down the elevator while we clean this floor out. I don&#39;t want anything escaping from this place.&quot;</span>

&quot;Agreed.&quot; He nodded, glancing over the map hologram from afar. &quot;Though we should consider a full reactor collapse on our way out, let everything burn and be swallowed up by the oceans.&quot;

&quot;We will have to check for critical locations on our way down.&quot; He was holding by the threshold, back turned to the room after finishing the quick inspection, waiting to move out. &quot;Ready when you are.&quot;</span>

&quot;No, no, consider the ecological consequences.  Collapsing the facility would release its contents into the ocean.&quot;

The hologram displayed an animation of the local ocean currents, from the initial survey that had preceded the base&#39;s construction.

&quot;Machine oil is bad enough.  There&#39;s also the fuel for the reactor, whatever noxious juices they use for decontamination, and how sure are we that the Sentient bits are fully dead?&quot;</span>

&quot;I&#39;m not concerned about the effects of most of that list considering that this is a planetary ocean larger than Earth roughly 57 times over. But the Sentient parts, yes, those are too much of a threat to risk letting into any ecosystem. We eliminate all Sentient presence in this facility, destroy any and all data and machinery related to the production of these new clone designs, and then we get out. Without their actual end goal as an option, the Grineer will scrub the operation and either detonate it themselves or repurpose it. Either way, our job will be done.&quot;

A ping from Intellectus told him that the copying of the map layout was completed. The Excalibur turned to his fellow Tenno and locked view with each of them. &quot;Any complaints, voice them now. We&#39;ve got another floor to go, and I&#39;m starting to suspect we&#39;re drawing attention to ourselves. Another Grineer ship could&#39;ve arrived by now and is moving in behind us as we speak.&quot;</span>

&quot;You want to talk &#39;ecological consequences&#39;?&quot; He growled, &quot;think about what happens if any of the stuff here manages to get into Grineer hands. I&#39;m going to stop that from happening, and if that means some fish die to make it happen, I can live with that.&quot; 

He paced away from the console, joining the other Tenno. 

&quot;No complaints here. Let&#39;s go see if these freaks are bulletproof.&quot;</span>

&quot;No time to lose, then. Right this way.&quot; He said, in a mimicry of an attendant&#39;s tone, although his voice made it sound more like a run down dinner than a fancy hotel. With a small nod in the direction of the hallway he led the way deeper into the facility, gradually accelerating into a fast, yet controlled jog, gun and knife at the ready.</span>

Red alarm lights throughout the level were already flashing, with some rooms featuring the haunting sound of a low-pitched siren permeating the air. Things seemed to be in alert, but the source of the alert couldn’t seem to be found at all.

Eventually they opened a set of heavy double doors to the very large room labelled “Completed Prototypes” on their map. There in the low crimson light sat rows upon rows of hybrids slumbering inside cloning vats. There must’ve been at least two hundred of them in this room alone.~</span>

&quot;Looking for the terminal now. Lupin should be able to connect the scans to you from there, Karsk.&quot;

The Excalibur walks down the rows of tubes at a brisk pace, keeping his sidearm raised, just in case one of these hybrids got it into their heads to suddenly come to life and break free for a fight. He kept his eyes peeled for the vat control system as he went, suspecting it to either be on the far side of the rows, or in a central location.

&quot;Hydroid, keep watch for patrols, if you would. It&#39;s probably going to get even louder once we start purging these things.&quot;</span>

We should handle this personally, really make sure there&#39;s nothing left. Besides, I doubt that machine would be able to snuff out the Sentient bits of them anyway.&quot;</span>

The merging of the two types of organisms was rough and scarred near their transition points with misaligned features. The scan didn’t take long.

Dominus walked between tubes of sleeping Frakensteinian monsters, ears filled with the cacophony of their bubbling liquids. The low light levels and flashing red alarms on the illuminated silhouettes of the creatures. Some held saws in place of hands, some had large antenna protruding from their shoulders, and some had been relieved of their legs. At the end of one of the rows was a large mechanical panel that held knobs and levers galore. In its center sat a flashing red monitor with four words on it: Critical Warning: Evacuate Facility.

At that very moment, a single <em>BANG</em> rang from the floor near Lupin’s feet. A few seconds of silence followed.

<em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> 

<em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em>

Soon, a number of loud banging noises erupted from beneath the Tenno. The floor around the area visibly shook with each hit.~</span>

The Excalibur inspected the panel closely, trying to determine exactly which apparatuses controlled what. He knew full well that evacuating the facility was a good idea, but Tenno didn&#39;t exactly thrive on logical thinking, most days.

Then the clanging sounds. He swung his weapon, and his gaze, across the room, trying to isolate exactly where the sounds were emanating from, and put distance between himself and them. Whatever might be trying to break through wasn&#39;t going to do it right from under his feet. Still, he had to keep close to the panel, in case one of the controls was what they needed to flush the whole place.

&quot;Karsk! Can you see anything? Where the hell is that coming from? And what am I hitting to shut down this operation?&quot;</span>

&quot;What the-?&quot; He whispered after the very first bang, crouching on the spot to put a hand against the floor. Then the second and third bangs reverberated through his hand and feet, threatening to throw him off balance.

&quot;Move!&quot; He shouted just as much to himself as for everyone else, as he regained his momentum and dashed away from the epicentre of the strikes. &quot;Breach imminent on my six.&quot; He added, already mid stride as he attempted to tag the map for the others.</span>

Black fluid began pouring down each of the vats, mixing with the sickly green vat juice to create a horrible concoction.

A final <em>BANG</em> from below warped the floor upwards. A moment of silence passed.

Then a new, high-pitched ringing sounded. A thin red laser pierced through the now small hill of dented ferrite. It swept across the deformation in a circle it connected on the other side, cutting the metal shape out, which was then yanked downwards with a screech.

A large cyan orb emerged from the hole, firing omnidirectional lasers in every direction. It smashed the glass of the nearby tubes, heated orange lines of ferrite floor, and scorched Lupin’s sword-steel chassis.

Following just beneath it was a single battalyst, but for some reason it was free to move around while channeling its omnidirectional orb. Locking on to the nearest target, it levelled one of its tuning-fork arms to Lupin. Sparks of purple sentient energy danced between the prongs as it charged an attack.~</span>

&quot;Son of a kubrodon!&quot; He snapped as the interface informed him of the sights placed on him, though he was already well aware given the searing sensation on his back.  &quot;No cordiality it is.&quot; He added as he raised his gun and aimed.

<em>KATHUNK-THUNK</em> - Two shots of his pyrana were aimed in the general direction of the battalyst&#39;s prongs, though the second was essentially a blind shot as he&#39;d resumed his run - away from the enemy and towards cover.

<em>&quot;Reposition while this thing is after me. Double time.&quot;</em> He barked over comms, ready to use his parazon to perform an emergency turn-slide to delay the impending laser galore from catching him.</span>

Max sensed more than felt the cold sweat break out, as he looked towards the battalyst emerge from the lower floor, as it shot its lasers all over. Lupin was already drawing its fire, so if he just got his Latron and sent off a shot, he could-

<em>Draw your sword.</em>

Something from his memories. Fighting Sentients had never been one of his strong suits, but for some reason...don&#39;t think about it right now. He flung himself from the console, tracking the Sentient even as he bulletjumped closer to it, angling between the tubes and sliding to close the gap. As soon as the range allowed, he would do the only sensible thing against a creature that hated the Void.

He would clap his Warframe&#39;s hands, and draw a blade made entirely of Void energy. Slashing the air, he would send a sword beam towards the Sentient, aiming to do some damage and disorient it until he could close to melee.</span>

&quot;What the hell is this thing!?&quot; He barked at the other two Tenno.

~Bits of Pyrana shrapnel and Grakata bullets shredded the battalyst’s shield as it launched an energy orb straight into Lupin’s back as he ran. The moment after, Dominus’s energy slash slammed into it from the back, forcing it to lurch forward. Small wisps of smoke rose out of the new blackened streak across its back. The battalyst swivelled its head to face him with a robotic expression.

The omni directional lasers ceased as the entire body of the sentient flickered until it was covered in black and blue light. It locked two arms on Dominus and glided through the air, physically passing through the wreckage of Grineer-hybrid containers like a ghost and rising higher into the air. Purple energy sparked along both arms.

At the same time, two conculysts burst through the hole and scanned their environment. Their sensors locked on to the Tenno in the room.~</span>

The Excalibur drew himself into a parrying stance, ready to intercept whatever the battalyst threw at him as he began charging. If it hesitated to attack, or looked elsewhere, he would send another sword beam at it. If he could close the distance, he&#39;d once again bulletjump, trying to carve a swathe through its chassis and end things quickly. That purple energy was...familiar. Dangerously familiar. As he went on the offensive, he called out to the others.

&quot;These are Sentients. Enemies of the Old War, that almost wiped out the entire system. They adapt to your attacks, so you&#39;ll need to mix it up. I have piercing with my Latron, radiation from my kitgun, and obviously my sword. My Exalted Blade also <em>should</em> disrupt their adaptation since it uses Void energy. But for all we know that might be what the Grineer were hybridizing them against. In which case, we need to kill everything here.&quot;</span>

A loud vocalised hiss was sent through the comms, as the feedback of the hit cut him off before he could speak. His parazon anchored him off from sliding and tumbling out of control, but it was far from a smooth manoeuvre. Controlling the end of his spin, he raised the pistol-shotgun back towards the energised battalyst, only to find it charging <em>away</em> from him.

&quot;And luckily for us, they mostly kept archaic designs. Just aim for the head, but-&quot; He added at the end of Dominus&#39; explanation, stopping only at the notice of the two new contenders. &quot;-but be careful: they rarely are alone.&quot; He finished amidst bullet jumping behind machinery and sliding to a stop to reload the gun.</span>

&quot;Tenno,&quot; said the scratchy voice from the intercom, &quot;Why don&#39;t you use your Void beams?&quot;  He was annoyed.  They were being idiots.  &quot;We know that is the way to  fight Sentients.&quot;  They were also risking his life, sort of.

The Sentients, if left active, would interface with the base&#39;s computer and consume him, or at least, this instance of him.  They would gain knowledge of the inner workings of his mind, which would make it harder for him to fight them if he ever had to, and also creeped him out.

Meanwhile, he would awaken from his backup on Narakis&#39;s ship, with no memory of what had happened since he&#39;d loaded himself into the datamass to come down from orbit.  That would be back to square one for this mission, an annoyingly restrictive obligation that he wanted over with.

Needless to say, he wanted to avoid this, but there was nothing he could do except hope that the Tenno heeded his advice.  Considering the average Tenno&#39;s track record, Karsk was not optimistic.</span>

&quot;That is definitely new.&quot; He spat out as he struggled to twist his body around and kicked off the now useless cover to slide away on his back, emptying the freshly loaded magazine into the point-blank conculyst.

Where was he?  He&#39;d never been here before.

He remembered...  He remembered he&#39;d been on a mission to infiltrate a Grineer base, with a Tenno who used Nova.  He remembered why the base was important, he remembered their plan.  He remembered making a backup on his moa, and that he&#39;d been about to load himself into a datamass.

Now here he was, no datamass, no Tenno, sitting at the entrance to a Grineer base.  Hopefully it was the right one.  How had his body gotten here, anyway?  That wasn&#39;t part of the plan.

Probably, the mission had gone wrong, the datamass was destroyed, and he&#39;d reloaded from a backup.  That would explain the gap in his memory.  Karsk hated when things like this happened.  Unnatural.  Sometimes he wished he could just die normally, but there was just too much going on, so much interesting to watch, so much bumbling to make fun of.  Except when he had to reload a backup.  It meant he&#39;d missed something important.  It also meant that this time, the bumble was his, and even though he always eventually managed to get over it, even though he told himself to accept his mistakes and be humble and learn, he still hated it.

He picked his way carefully toward the crashed ship, looking around and listening for anything that moved, listening for any comms signals that might be flying past, anything that could give a clue as to where he was or how he&#39;d gotten there.</span>

Karsk was right, obviously, but using his Operator&#39;s pure Void abilities was...difficult, for him. But the Cephalon and the others had no way of knowing that. He kept tracking the Tau orbs as he closed the gap with the original battalyst, and at the last second attempted to roll clear of them, and underneath its floating chassis in the same movement, drawing his kitgun to fire up at the Sentient with several thumps of irradiated blasts.

&quot;Lupin, I don&#39;t suppose you have an amp you could use if we gave you cover, do you?&quot;

He noticed the additional contacts swarming through the hole they&#39;d made. This was bad. <em>Really</em> bad. He sent a request to Intellectus, for the Cephalon to send out a distress signal to any other potential Tenno in their region of space. If the Sentients were this numerous in some secret Grineer base, it was becoming all of their problems.</span>

The sentient fragment brought up its black-and-blue energy form once again and the rest of the clip passed right through its body.

One of the battalyst reinforcements hovered around the room in phasing form and charged two orbs at him from the back.

Two more orbs slammed into the floor next to Dominus as he rolled forward. His kitgun blasted three shots of his kitgun, depleting the shields of his battalyst and then some. Before Dominus could get any more damage in, the sentient brought up its intangible form once again. The fourth shot flew straight through it.

The Hydroid grabbed the blunt-headed Zaw on his back and cracked it down on the head of the first Conculyst.

Just when he thought weapons were proving a bit too effective, the sentient reinstated his fears as they displayed their phasing capabilities. He seen vomvalysts capable of de-phasing, but those were built with that capacity in mind, and their lower mass and volume was no coincidence in that matter, not to mention non of them possessed something the accuracy and reaction time the current threat flaunted.

With no room to spare, he rolled to his side, narrowly dodging the sentient&#39;s baton-arm, and springing onto his feet gauging the distance to the now two sentient near him.

<em>&quot;If their ability is anything like a vomvalysts then maybe...&quot;</em> He thought as he focused his sights on the phased battalyst charging the next volley. Either way, it was best to cut them off than continue on the defence. He lowered his centre of mass and broke into a bullet jump towards the battalyst, contorting his frame mid-air as he begun the disk-throwing motion that his Tenno body completed as it materialised out its back.

In his true body, now devoid of the Grineer disguise from earlier, Lupin seemed far too frail for the prospect of the current combat. A skin-tight bulletproof vest was all that remained to protect him, and that would pose little resistance against the Sentients. Still, his light frame contorted to put every bit of strength to throw a void energy disk - its lilac glow quickly tinting his pale-gold skin, while the red highlights in his otherwise raven hair gained a new intensity in the light.</span>

Intangibility. Lovely. Still, he was having an effect, if the Sentient felt it necessary to use that ability at all. He made a brief visual sweep of the larger battlefield, spotting the newly approaching conculyst, and more importantly, the pressure the Hydroid was starting to face.

Max glanced back at his foes, and without a word, tore off at an angle, firing off rounds from his kitgun at the backs of the Hydroid&#39;s enemies, in an attempt to try and leave an opening for him as he made distance with his own targets.

&quot;I&#39;d recommend you do some of that famous crowd control your frame is renowned for, friend. We&#39;re already underwater, the depths would be a mighty fine ally right now.&quot;

If push came to shove, he might be able to use <em>that</em> to do something. But he didn&#39;t know if he really had the capacity to channel that much energy. With any luck, they could start dismantling these enemies sooner rather than later.

No response from Intellectus&#39;s distress beacon yet, either. This was getting very bad.</span>

Nothing moved.  Obviously, a group of Tenno had come by here recently.  What else would cause such carnage?  Anyway, they seemed to be gone now.

There was something...  A signal from below.  A distress signal.  Tenno.  Interesting.  The Tenno were still here, and apparently over their heads in whatever was down there.

Karsk responded to the ping with an open communications channel.

<strong>Base Karsk:</strong>
The datascape here was sparse, an open plain of yellow gridlines, dotted with consoles.  Defenceless.  Karsk had gotten in here easily, and for the Sentients, once they were finished with the Tenno, it would be even easier.

Of course, then they would have to deal with him.  He couldn&#39;t defeat them but maybe he could hold them off long enough for someone to plug in a datamass and give him a chance to escape.

He glanced at one of the consoles, seeing through a security camera into the lab with the attacking Sentients.  The Tenno were giving no sign of transference.  One had even mentioned that these Sentients might be like vomvalysts.  So... where was the famous Tenno reaction time?  What were they doing?

He stood tall, and began to crack his joints.  Virtually, at least.  A final check of himself.  Then he began to dance, populating the yellow grid with patterns of shifting data, life of sorts, to confuse and overwhelm, at least for a while.</span>

&quot;Yeah, I got it,&quot; the Hydroid growled irritably. &quot;Move.&quot; 

He shifted into his water form and surged across the room, dragging his two assailants with him and into the wall on the opposite side of the room. It certainly didn’t kill them, but it gave him a little breathing room. Re-emerging from that state, he turned about face and formed a torrent of void-infused water around him, then released it to summon his frame&#39;s famous chthonic ally in the center of the room. He wasn&#39;t keen on playing his trump card so soon, but they didn&#39;t have the time to waste on these things.</span>

Karsk felt the connection worm its way into the systems, only to then be stuck in an eternal maze of a game of life. It was fighting with all its processing power, but it wasn’t enough. At least, as long as there was only one.

The Tenno heard more screeching coming from the hole. Eight more battalysts erupted from its depths, scanning the situation. Four of them charged lasers in their left arms and lined up side by side, facing the action. Karsk felt the other four join the cyberspace and begin fighting against the maze with their comrade, to which they began making ground.~</span>

&quot;Void energy still works against their phasing.&quot; He informed the others over comms, readying another charge from his amp, but it might as well have been a strongly worded complaint given the rate at which reinforcements seemed to join the fray.

&quot;There are too many to fight them head on!&quot; He let loose a second energy disk at the battalist before dashing to re-merge with the Inaros. &quot;We need a different approach.&quot; He continued, rolling over and vaulting onto his feet.

&quot;First, figure out where they are coming from.&quot; He pointed out as he made a move towards the center of this chaos; dashing, dodging and weaving to peer into the hole in the hull.</span>

&quot;Noted. I&#39;d use an amp, but...&quot; The Excalibur had tucked and rolled with the impact from the conculyst that had struck him, setting his feet and rushing back into it with an upward vertical cut from his maintained Exalted Blade. He wasn&#39;t certain how much longer he could keep it running, but for now it was his best option to actually give off some damage.

&quot;Karsk! Are you still online? I notice a couple of these things are going dark, I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re entering the system. We can get you out if you&#39;re becoming overwhelmed. If we can&#39;t cut off the source, we may have no other choice but to bug out for now and get help. This is way too many without the right equipment.&quot;

He glanced over at the currently unoccupied datamass still sitting by the first terminals they found in the room. It would be a bit of a feat to bounce over there with all of the chaos unfolding around them.</span>

The five sentient fragments battled their way through the datascape, changing their goal from the turrets straight to Karsk himself. They now rapidly pushed their way through his maze towards him.

The conculyst brought up its phasing form to attempt to avoid the attack, but it didn’t matter. Dominus’s exalted blade pulled it up in the air a little further as it cleaved the sentient fragment through its midsection, destroying it.

The battalyst took Lupin’s second disc to the back, then swirled around and started to charge an arm, only to quickly halt it. The remaining sentients engaged in combat flew up to the ceiling synchronously, just before the four battalysts standing at the back released streams of yellow sentient energy from their arms. They swept their beams across the room, searing the Tenno along the way.~</span>

The sight of more and more Sentient interlopers was beginning to grate on the Hydroid&#39;s nerves. Luckily, he had a surprise waiting for them. As the machines entered the room, a veritable forest of tentacles shot up from the floor, each greedily grasping for the newly arrived Sentients. One after another they found their mark, and began to thrash about the room, violently slamming their captives into the floor and ceiling. It was a start, but he knew it wouldn&#39;t hold them for long.

&quot;I&#39;ll hold &#39;em here!&quot; He barked at the other Tenno as he began charging up a Tempest Barrage for the nearer five.  &quot;Just focus on one of them at a time!&quot; 
He loosed his attack, a downpour of acidic missiles raining down on the Sentients that Lupin and Dominus were currently fighting. They slammed onto them in their phasing forms and crippled one of them near Dominus. With that, he holstered his current weapons and pulled his Corinth off his back, ready to join the others in mowing down their old foes.</span>

The Excalibur pushed past the downed conculyst, attempting to deflect as much of the beams with his blade as possible to ablate the damage. He bounded through the forest of tubes to reach the datamass, linking it with the terminal and opening a route for Karsk to escape. Meanwhile, he dispersed the Exalted Blade and took up the Thumper again, trying to maintain cover fire for his squad.

&quot;Mass is online! Bail out now, Karsk! As soon as he&#39;s in, we need to start falling back!&quot;

Dominus&#39;s Cephalon supervised his master&#39;s efforts, fretting and attempting to keep his strategic overlay updated, until he heard a transmission from the top of the facility. It sounded...like his associate currently in the systems already?

&quot;Hm? Is that you, Cephalon Karsk? Whatever are you doing in a Moa? How did you get there from inside the facility? Well, nothing for it, the squad inside are struggling to contain the Sentient threat. Is there anyone up there with you?&quot;</span>

His sprint to the hole had been somewhat staggered due to the odd stray laser catching him from an unseen angle, causing him to stagger and vault to avoid yet another strike.

&quot;On it, but I do not think any amount of focusing will solve this issue.&quot; He replied to the Hydroid, then changed directions, charging towards the nearest held fragment, hoping the energy beast&#39;s tendrils would last long enough to secure him a point-blank shot at the thing&#39;s core. &quot;The hole is crawling with them, another wake incoming quick.

Lines of gliders twitched behind him, marching across the grid, leaving chaotic growths and sparks where they collided.  Hopefully it would be enough.  Hopefully it would delay them long enough for Dominus to...

Lupin caught similar sear marks across his torso. The four reinforcements charge orbs in both arms. The datascape-bound sentients greedily tore through gliders, spaceships, and blinkers. The myriad of lights kept ascending through the hole in the floor.

Then the door the Tenno had come from flew open, revealing a black and yellow-coloured Limbo with a salix syandana weidling a synoid gammacor in front of him.

The Limbo barely took in the sight for half a second before brandishing a staggering amount of Rift energy in each hand with a sweeping motion. He pooled the energy together to form a swirling ball and threw it in the center of the room. Everyone in the room was washed in purple light as a Cataclysm expanded and they were sent into the Rift.

At the end of his throw, the Limbo twirled around and swept both his hands across the room in a gripping gesture, slowing relative time for the warframes by half and freezing everything else in place.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong>
“WHAT… in the MUCK is happening in here!” the Limbo hollered.</span>

A bright golden Saryn decorated in a flowery motif stepped up just behind the Limbo, rubico held upwards in one hand as it reached out toward the nearest battalyst, infecting it with her spores. She then leveled the rifle and fired at the sentient&#39;s head, the heavy sniper round shattering it. The spores on it popped, spreading them to nearby sentients as she began taking aim at the next one, taking her time to not waste a shot since the Limbo had been so kind as to freeze them in place and apparently already put her into the Rift.</span>

Finally, just behind the limbo and Saryn, a gunmetal and green trimmed vauban stepped into the rift, causally dropping an overdriver at the groups feet with an energetic thud once he saw the Saryn draw her rifle.
“Not sure what we’re seeing, but whatever it is, I think our old war foes are having a small field day.” He said, leveling his sobek at the closest target.</span>

The beams burned into his back and threw him to the ground right as the Excalibur pulled the datamass containing Karsk from the terminal. As the Cataclysm engulfed him, he slowly pushed to his feet.

&quot;What you&#39;re seeing, is a Grineer facility that was presumably experimenting with Sentients, and it went horribly out of control. The three of us weren&#39;t exactly equipped for a fight like this, but we&#39;ve been trying to contain it. My Cephalon, Intellectus, sent out a distress beacon on Tenno frequencies. Were you responding to that?&quot;

He then gestures with the datamass, taking the opportunity of slowed time to reload his weapons. &quot;We also had a particularly bold independent Cephalon join us for the mission to help out with acquiring data on the proceedings here. His name is Karsk. My callsign is Dominus, by the way.&quot;

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

The servile Cephalon quietly attempted to open a video link with Moa-Karsk, to share what he was now seeing inside the facility through Max&#39;s neuroptics. &quot;How curious...my Master has just pulled a datamass containing a shard of you from the facility&#39;s systems. You had initially been infiltrating the base alongside a Nova tasked with helping you to study the goings-on, as I&#39;ve come to understand. She was called to another mission, and so you were given over to my Master and his companion. Does your failsafe activate in the event that your signal is cut off?&quot;</span>

While fire and metal usually weren&#39;t much of a problem to recover from for the kingly frame, the former had always been one of the most unnerving sensations to share even when dulled by the void - searing beams were far from being an exception. His movements slowed down as he was midway into springing back and away from the sentient, covering the now seared portion of his torso.

&quot;Impeccable timing.&quot; He congratulated the Limbo as he took a moment of the reprieve to reload the pistol and pick the next target.

&quot;Lupin here - and as Dominus said: the sentient threat is far more numerous and active than we expected.&quot; The frustration in his voice was clear, though the intensity was channelled back into the killing at hand, it was evident this was an unforgivable kind of oversight in planning. &quot;Care to join in?&quot;</span>

Hearing Lupin&#39;s earlier warning, he charged up another full-power Tempest Barrage, this time aimed squarely at the hole the rest of the sentients were coming from to buy them time.

~The Saryn began shredding sentients, taking two out in quick succession. After a couple seconds, all the sentients in the room and in the datascape began to make very slow movements again.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
“Yes!” The limbo replied, hands still outstretched and grasping at the fabric of time within his bubble of Rift. He shifted his focus so that Dominus, Lupin, and the Hydroid returned to the normal flow of time.

“I got your signal and came to check it out. Move fast, the sentients are already adapting to my Rift signature. Do you know where they’re coming from?”</span>

He refrained from putting the datamass back inside the system, noticing that everything was beginning to resume its movement. Better he didn&#39;t send a Cephalon off to die.

&quot;From what we can tell, they&#39;re pouring out of that hole, somewhere near the bottom.&quot;

Dominus too took advantage of the time dilation to once again draw his Exalted Blade and begin summarily executing Sentients by pushing the Void-stuff sword into their cores, hoping to literally cut down their numbers before they actually made a push for the origin point.

&quot;We&#39;ve been getting a bit thrown around, as you can tell, so I&#39;d rather we run cover and support for you, since your team is still fresh.&quot;

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

&quot;A Limbo and some additional forces have joined the fight, it would seem. Time dilation is slightly disrupting communications, but I will send for my Master to do something about your split situation as soon as possible. It may not be until they exterminate the Sentient threat, as the base systems are a bit compromised. In the meantime, do you have transportation? Or will you be needing a ride off planet for today?&quot;

A Cephalon that preferred to not use active shards. How fascinating!</span>

With the normal flow of time restored, and now with extra firepower at his back, the Hydroid holstered his shotgun, turning his full attention to keeping their foes at bay. He called one caustic volley of water down after another, targeting every visible group of Sentients, including those that were still in the clutches of his summoned companion. To the other Tenno, it would have almost seemed as if they were caught in the middle of a torrential downpour.

&quot;Hurry up and finish them!&quot; he gasped over comms as the rain thundered around them. &quot;I can hold them, but I don&#39;t know for how long!&quot;

~The group of Tenno began to make short work of a lot of the frozen sentients. They were shattered, sliced, and corroded under the barrage of their attacks with very little speed to adapt to the attacks with. Half of them managed to switch to their phasing forms just before becoming next on the chain, but even though they did every physical bullet was still damaging their chassis! Something had changed.

By the time they had finished adapting to the Rift, all of them but the ones still held in the Void Kraken’s tentacles were destroyed. Their corpses floated in mid-air, suspended in time as they lost their ability to function.~</span>

The Limbo saw the sentients finish adaptation and collapsed his swirling Cataclysm. He shifted the flow of the Rift energy coursing through his warframe and ripped another hole in the fabric of reality, changing up his Rift signature. The sentients froze again, though they would be moving a lot sooner this time.

The Limbo approached the hole slowly, keeping his focus on freezing the time around him. Once he reached it, he glanced down to see a myriad of shiny lights making their way towards him, and Lupin firing on one just before it started phasing again. The Limbo’s Cataclysm only extended slightly below the floor, catching two brachiolysts as they attempted to enter the room.
The Limbo’s mind ran at a rapid pace, piecing together dozens of possibilities to deal with this situation. Most of them weren’t going to work against sentients.

“Everyone split up and either blast the ones still here or send some bullets down this hole. We’re gonna need to just keep fighting through them.”</span>

&quot;On it, I&#39;ve got the ammo to spare. Suppressing.&quot; The Excalibur dispersed his Blade once again, unholstering the Latron from his back and jogging up next to the Limbo currently saving his and the rest of his impromptu strike team&#39;s asses. He began sending fire down into the hole, focusing on destroying the two captured brachiolysts first before adjusting his aim to the rest of the inbound lights. With each shot, the datamass on the opposite hip from his real sword jostled, reminding him of the cargo.

&quot;I&#39;d like to also get the Cephalon out of here sooner rather than later, if at all possible. Anyone interested in making a dash for the surface to drop this off with my LC? If I can get the word out to my own Cephalon, he might be able to get us a capsule for repairs and/or energy for us to use too.&quot;

Intellectus had been quiet, which he chalked up to the time distortions. Hopefully life outside the bubble wasn&#39;t falling totally to pieces.</span>

Angstrum rockets, buckshot, and Tesla nervos swarmed towards the sentient combatants, the Vauban clearly fixed on doing as much damage as physically possible. That’s when he heard the Excalibur call out.
“If no one else can evac your cephalon, the path we took to get in should still serve as a viable egress point. We’ll make sure to cover you.”
With that, and another round from his angstrum, the Vauban called to the rest of the group. 
“If the rest of you have amps, I think now is the time for us to use them!” He said, refreshing his overdriver, and taking aim once again at the sentients ahead, keeping a knelt footing for what was to come next.</span>

With the rest of the impromptu crew coming to the rescue and now joining him at the void-ridden hell gate, he could finally take a moment to reassess the situation somewhat more calmly.

&quot;I can take the data mass back topside, taking their entry route.&quot; He said as he reloaded in tandem with the next wave of suppressing fire. &quot;Need to get some additional firepower dropped.&quot; He added just in time to switch back to emptying another clip of the Pyrana into the hole.

“UGH!” The Limbo grunted in frustration, “I can’t think of anything better than keeping our position here and blasting until they get tired. This is a good choke point, so if we have the ammo and power to spare we can keep trying to chew through them until it looks like there’s too many, then we retreat.”

The Excalibur wastes no time in lifting the datamass off of his hip and passing it to Lupin, resuming fire almost immediately as he hands it off. A ping finally makes its way through the time dilation, and he side-eyes the message, skims it, and speaks up.

&quot;While you&#39;re up there, another supply drop will come in from my Cephalon when he picks up Karsk. He&#39;s handing off my Carrier drone. Grab it and bring it with you, please. Also, just got a feed from Intellectus saying that a backup shard of him is currently sitting there in a Moa, activated after the Sentients got too close for comfort. They should be able to reunite, and I&#39;ll take him onboard my Orbiter for safety.&quot;

Karsk&#39;s comments gave Max a moment&#39;s pause, and with a sigh, he responded to him.

&quot;I...have an amp. I just haven&#39;t used it. I&#39;m not good with them, but we don&#39;t have much choice. After this clip, I&#39;ll Transfer back out.&quot; He continued his magdump, silently dreading that click. Once it inevitably happened, he speedily reloaded the Latron and then slipped his body back out of the Warframe, bracing his right arm equipped with an unpainted Mote Amp.  The lanky Operator sent a beam of Void energy down into the hole, strafing the Sentients emerging. His face contorted into one of extreme focus, and the beam flickered more than what would be expected from a Tenno.

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

Finally, his messages got through! Intellectus established a shaky, but active, connection to his Master once again, and the two swiftly exchanged information and requests. Evaluating the combat situation, things looked...oh dear. He needed to work fast.

&quot;Apologies, I was busy trying to slip through a Limbo distortion, and organize a supply canister for my Master at the same time. I&#39;ve informed him of the situation, and he should be sending your other half up with an ally soon, while he keeps up the fight.&quot;

The Cephalon dutifully set about putting together the requested supply pod, feeling it a <em>tad</em> wasteful to use one just for a drone that he could replace in a few hours. But desperate times, he supposed. And the Master&#39;s orders were absolute.</span>

He grabbed the datamass with no further word, but a simple nod of acknowledgement to the additional request. He then turned to follow the route the reinforcements had taken.

&quot;Hold the line, 5 minutes ETA.&quot; He added as he was passing the threshold out the room.

Then, switching to his private comms he sent out the emergency delivery request to his cephalon: ammo packs and the archgun. <em>&quot;No time for chit-chat, Hue&quot;</em> Was all he could add to the message before sending it and breaking into a full on sprint.</span>

&quot;Frankly I have no idea where our mark could be now or what the muck they could be up to. There&#39;s no way it they could&#39;ve known about all this,&quot; the Limbo responded.

<strong>Hydroid:</strong> 
&quot;Wait for them to get tired?&quot; the Hydroid repeated incredulously, pulling his shotgun off his shoulder and reloading while taking a position near the edge of the pit. &quot;What war were you part of? These things don&#39;t <em>get</em> tired! Either we kill them or they kill us!&quot; 

Without having a clear target, the Hydroid launched five grenades from his Corinth into the darkness below, each blast briefly illuminating the horde of Sentients.

~Three grenades comprised of void energy launched from the Vauban&#39;s Granmu Prism and exploded on top of the nearest sentient, ripping it to pieces and injuring nearby sentients. The ascending enemies kept taking the sustained fire now mixed with void energy until suddenly, they stopped. In unison, they switched on their phasing forms and let gravity pull themselves back down, down, down into the darkness.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
The Limbo fell prone and stuck his head over the edge of the hole, watching them retreat.

&quot;See? Get tired. Or tactically retreat. Whichever way you wanna say it,&quot; he clarified. Pulling his head out of the hole and into eye level with the group. He didn&#39;t make any move to release his hold on the Rift Cataclysm yet.

&quot;I had a feeling they were bluffing. They must be low on forces and intel down there and didn&#39;t want to risk it all. We scared them, if just a little. That just makes their presence here even more confusing,&quot; his eyes drifted to one of the cloning vats that had crashed onto the floor, spilling out its deceased, hybridized occupant. 

&quot;...Though, I&#39;m beginning to figure it out.&quot;</span>

The Saryn pulled out a scanner and made her way over to the hybrids and began to take some readings.
&quot;Now both factions are experimenting with sentients. How wonderful.&quot; She says, her voice utterly flat in intonation.

The Sentients were retreating. Max gave himself a slight bit of credit for the defense, but for the most part he knew it had been the efforts of their new allies that had really made the difference. Flexing the hand his Mote Amp covered, he slowly felt his body pull back to the confines of the Excalibur frame, straightening out its back and standing up, once again Dominus.

&quot;Maybe we can use this downtime for a bit of context. Lupin and I were here to do just that, look into the Grineer operations and if necessary, purge any data they had on Sentient functions, before wrecking the place and rendering it unusable. As we made our way inside, we ran into-&quot; He gestures to the Hydroid, &quot;-our friend here, who had been ripping and tearing their way through the facility for reasons I don&#39;t think we ever got out of you.&quot;

Finally, he turned to the Limbo and his cadre, rolling his neck to break up some of his stiffness. &quot;So what mark exactly are you pursuing? Could they have anything to do with this as well?&quot;</span>

Initially unaware to the change in degree of urgency (though the existence of the threat was in itself justification enough), he had kept his sprint up, towards the surface, and (hopefully) to an awaiting combination of reinforcements and airlift for the new cephalon acquaintance.

It would still take him at least another minute or so to reach the surface, and even then the alert on the corner of his eye informed him that landing was (as expected) dangerous and likely to expose the operation, but that hardly mattered any more, and his repeated hand gestures to dismiss the messages made a point of it.

&quot;Any updates?&quot; He managed to ask on comms as he slowed down to gauge between the elevator or a long climb up a ventilation shaft.</span>

In another flash of green and orange light, the young man was gone, the Vauban rising to its feet again and moving towards one of the hybrids.
“We’re technically still trying to figure that part out.” The Vauban said, giving the Excalibur a glance before kneeling next to the body. 
“Certainly made a mess of the grineer up top. Some of them anyway.” He turned to look at the Limbo he came in with.

&quot;Like I told that Cephalon, you can take all the data you want. I&#39;m killing everything in here, breaking everything else, then flooding the place.&quot; Peering downwards, the Hydroid tried to get a read on how deep this pit was. With luck, it would take him somewhere he could do some real damage.

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
&quot;Good idea Chegar,&quot; the Limbo remarked before turning to Dominus.

&quot;Maybe. Probably not. We&#39;re chasing something that came here from the outside...&quot;

The Limbo looked down at the synoid gammacor on his hip. On the surface of its top-orientated prong, a small red symbol burned brightly, trailing small wisps of scattered energy particles as he moved slightly.</span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">It&#39;s here. On me.</span>

Everything next happened in the blink of an eye. The Limbo swiped over the mark and snapped the gammacor to his wrist. The lights on the device turned from their usual cyan to an angry red. The Limbo straightened up and sharply cried out as large red lines of energy surged from the device through his arm, over his shoulder, and directly into the torso of his chassis. His sight filled with red light as it revealed secrets to him regarding the true nature of certain things. Before he got a chance to get his bearings, the Hydroid&#39;s shadow expanded twice in size across the floor and rounded out into an oval shape. At the same time, it rose out of the ground like a mass of indeterminable black goop.

The Limbo&#39;s head snapped to its position and he quickly aimed his gammacor at it. It pulsed with deadly red light and filled the air with an oscillating vibrations as it charged. The Hydroid took a step back, only to find his ankles bound by the goop. It opened up like a large maw and proceeded to swallow him whole. A beam of red energy released from the Limbo&#39;s gammacor only to miss the creature by mere nanoseconds as it squished into a puddle on the floor and evaporated into thin air, taking the Hydroid with it. 

The beam collided with a tank positioned behind where the Hydroid use to stand, but didn&#39;t mark the glass at all. The Limbo tried to cut it off, but his own arm wouldn&#39;t respond to his wishes. His eyes went wide with panic as he swung his other arm over the gammacor to pull it off. With a few swipes he managed to stop the beam, but the red veins of energy wouldn&#39;t leave his chassis. His arm was stuck in the pose of firing. He furiously ran his fingers over the gammacor, doing everything he could to get it to stop.</span>

The Vauban recoiled rapidly, launching himself backward towards the limbo. He pulled his angstrum, and readied a bastille in his off hand. 
“Alright. Does any one have anything like a flood light?! If this thing is binding to shadows, I wanna limit its movement!” He belted out, lobbing the bastille at the creatures last known location. That’s when he saw the limbo’s predicament.

Max was quick to react, switching over to his Pangolin Sword to use it as a focus, and once again unholstering Thumper to act as a sidearm.

&quot;I can illuminate. Starting with three pulses, then maintaining.&quot;

Raising the sword high above his head, a purple light began gathering at the tip, the Excalibur keeping his vision locked on the Limbo (they called him Dis, he thought he heard) as he struggled with his sidearm. Was this creature affecting their weapons? Or the functions of their frames as a whole?

&quot;Radial Blind, first pulse!&quot;

The blinding light went out, masked for Warframes yet still capable of illuminating most of their surroundings. Dominus swept his kitgun along a 180 degree angle, looking for this strange creature. He abstained from firing for the moment, to avoid getting locked into place like the Limbo had. Better safe than sorry.

&quot;Second pulse! What is this thing? New to you guys, or are you familiar?&quot;

The next wave of light went out, as the Excalibur twisted and swept his sidearm along the opposite degree, not sure how fast their quarry was really moving.

&quot;Third pulse, and maintaining!&quot;

One last wave, and then the glow stabilized, not quite as bright as the average Blind, but enough to cast them all in the purple aura, and more importantly, give whatever was on them fewer places to hide. He wasn&#39;t sure exactly how much energy he had left in the tank after his usage of the Exalted Blade. Hopefully Lupin brought the heavy artillery soon.</span>

The Saryn stood up from the corpse she was scanning as lupin mentioned the hydroid was was here from the start. Her grip shifted back to her rifle as she began to look around the rest of the room now, making her way around behind the hydroid. She didn&#39;t even wait for the Limbo&#39;s warning, her gun was already leveled on her opponent and finger squeezing the trigger by the time the signal went out, though in her effort to line up an easy shot to the head, the Limbo seemed to have inadvertently warned the thing with his scanner. One shot rang out at the mass as it consumed the hydroid.

Her gaze next fell upon that troublesome gammacor the limbo trying to turn off. For that she had a simple solution: another report filled the chamber as she fired at the gammacor, targeting the section positioned above his wrist.</span>

All three flashes came and went without anything out of the ordinary popping into view. Nothing seemed to be affected by the radial blind, at least.

Chegar&#39;s bastille met a similar predicament where it hit the ground, activated, and then didn&#39;t seem to catch anything within its stasis field.

The Saryn&#39;s shot harmlessly deflected off a building cluster of red energy radiating from the gammacor. Whatever was happening, the device was being protected.~

The Limbo watched the Saryn&#39;s shot accomplish nothing and fell to his knees, arm still locked in position.

Without another word the Saryn stepped up to the limbo, placing her rifle on her back and pulling out her massive galatine. She swung it downward at the Limbo&#39;s arm, aiming to cut just above whatever energy was protecting the gammacor ended, attempting to preserve as much of the arm as she could. Knowing how the fight with the Weaver went, they would need every portion of themselves as operational as could be for this fight.</span>

With the Limbo’s arm steady, Isa managed to barely cut through the chinks in his sword-steel and straight through his technocyte flesh, severing the arm from his body. In a flash of red light, it immediately ceased its function and the tendrils of energy around the Limbo dispersed as it dropped to the ground.

The Limbo fell into a sitting position, propping himself up on one of the nearby containers that hadn’t been completely decimated. He kicked his lost arm, with the gammacor still mounted to it, further away from him and caught his breath.

After a couple of seconds he looked up at the Excalibur who had been conversing with them.

“Sorry, explanations come now. You said your name was Dominus? Good to have you here. The Vauban’s Chegar, the Saryn’s Isa, and my name... is Disruptis.”</span>

Angstrum still in hand, the Vauban scanned the area for the target.

Finally, some proper introductions, if not a particularly intense way to get them. The Excalibur lowered his sword and looked back to the trio, staying where he was in the off-chance that whatever was attacking them focused him next, so the others didn&#39;t get caught in it.

&quot;The feeling&#39;s mutual, trust me. Nice to meet you all. With everything I&#39;ve seen so far, we definitely needed the extra firepower. That red light looked...bad. Real bad. Just what the hell is going on here?&quot;

The Vauban (Chegar, remember that) mentioned Vazarin. Someone that can heal even Warframes, fantastic.

&quot;Naramon, on my end. Not that there&#39;s been much opportunity for me to strategize thus far. But that&#39;s why I use an Excalibur. Easy to plan around cutting things up with a blade.&quot;</span>

Isa quietly placed her galatine on her back once more and drew her rifle.
&quot;You neglected to inform us of your gammacor&#39;s modifications. What exactly was it doing there?&quot;

She asked, seemingly having little to no interest in conversing with the others at this time. Even as she spoke to Disruptis she didn&#39;t look at him and instead moved about, weapon ready to fire on the creature should it appear again.</span>

&quot;Yes please, Chegar,&quot; Disruptis replied gratefully.  He addressed Isa next.

&quot;Four months back, shortly after the whole Weaver thing happened in Kawamo, we found something with the power to strip some types of abnormalities of their powers. Not only that though, but it <em>really</em> hurt them when hit with it, so much so that it would kill them with enough contact. All it takes is one good shot for most and it&#39;s lights out for them. Also can give you a special sight that outlines them for you, and doesn&#39;t even leave a scratch on anything that&#39;s not an abnormal. Really useful stuff. That&#39;s why I can tell you it somehow warped itself somewhere much lower in the facility. It&#39;s way out of our range now, but I&#39;m not sure if it can come back.&quot;

&quot;Problem is, this power... its got some really nasty pre-requisites that we&#39;re having trouble trying to meet, so barely anyone can use it. Chegar here is one of the few people that could&#39;ve taken a mark into his body to use it, but he respectfully declined and I totally get why. I installed a kind of hack to be able to use it myself, but it&#39;s not the first thing I think about using. Void, I probably wouldn&#39;t have even used it if we weren&#39;t also dealing with sentients for some reason.&quot;

He swiveled back to Dominus again, giving a weak smile in his Tenno form that couldn&#39;t be seen from the outside of his warframe. 

&quot;Uhhh... where to begin... have you heard of /RU Corp? Here to deal with the unknown when it inevitably comes? We came here to look for a creature with strange powers and capture or kill it. And as you can see it uh...&quot; the Limbo swallowed, &quot;...just escaped. Naramon on my end too, though. As of recently I specialize in making plans that fail.&quot;</span>

&quot;/RU Corp...vaguely. I&#39;ve seen the name in listings, that much I know for certain. Didn&#39;t think you were this involved, though.&quot;

Since the creature didn&#39;t seem inclined to strike out at them again, he slowly backs towards the rest of the team, dropping to one knee and letting out a breath, processing all of the incoming information.

&quot;So, first plan failed, but we do have the excuse of having several unforeseen variables throw themselves into the mix. So what&#39;s the next idea? Clean out these Sentients and then go hunting for your mark once Lupin&#39;s back with his weapon and my drone?&quot;</span>

She looked around the room once more.
&quot;Regardless of if we do or not, we should gather data on these subjects and wipe whatever the Grineer have on them here... and possibly destroy this base as well.

The vauban took a knee once more, it’s operator stepping into view again in another burst of void energy. He rushed over to Disruptis, letting a wave of regenerative void energy wash over the wounded limbo’s stump.
“Feels like a case of ‘<em>all roads lead to Rome</em>’ to me; recover as much data as we can, purge all mundane threats, and regroup to assess our plans, assets, and deficits.” He said, keeping an eye on the stump.

“Yeah Chegar, just get rid of it if you can,” Disruptis replied.

He took in a deep breath as the exposed technocyte flesh of his arm sealed up with swordsteel. The energy also closed deep wounds leftover from the lines that raced to the left side of his chest.

“I think you both got it right. Find out what the muck is going on here, don our Old War faces, then maybe save a Hydroid. If we can’t easily bag the SED, might as well just destroy it before it gets any funny ideas. It looked like it was hiding in the Hydroid’s shadow somehow, and if it can warp like that I’m not sure how to take it in with what we have on hand…. wait…”

The Limbo looked up at Dominus.

“You wanna help us with our mark?”</span>

The Excalibur would smile if he could. Instead, he just offers a thumbs-up.

&quot;I had honestly thought the SED was somehow disguising as the Hydroid to be honest and was about to put a bullet in its head. It was entirely too convenient. A water-controlling frame that was here before any of us. The Hydroid may very well be in league with it still.&quot;</span>

He looked around the group, mulling over what had been said.
&quot;Clean up the grineers mess, Find the SED, Rescue or salvage a Hydroid, and disposed of an arm.&quot; He said, Nodding. &quot;I&#39;d say we have a full docket.&quot; With that, he turned to Isa.

Disruptis let out a short, involuntary laugh before snapping his mouth shut.

<em>How long has it been since I’ve met a Tenno like this…</em> he mused, hanging his head.

“Thanks,” he said quietly.

The Limbo pushed himself off his back support and started pacing the room in thought.

“That’s the thing though Isa, I didn’t see anything really <em>abnormal</em> about the Hydroid through the Mark of Defying. Sure he might be in cahoots with that thing but… let’s just say that’d be a first for Weaver. She doesn’t like consorting with outside forces, especially Tenno. Could be wrong though, and as you know I’m not a fan of taking many chances right now.”</span>

&quot;He threw me off a bit when we first ran into the guy down here, but he committed to fighting the Sentients pretty fast. Either he&#39;s a great actor, or he&#39;s not a threat. And I think with a monster like that rolling around, he would&#39;ve attacked Lupin and I a lot earlier when we were by ourselves, rather than wait for an opportunity once we were all together.&quot;

He paused, thinking. Suddenly it dawned on him. &quot;Lupin. Do you think that thing is hunting him?&quot;

They&#39;d only been working together for a few hours, but it wouldn&#39;t do to leave a good Tenno in the lurch. They needed as much help as they could muster.</span>

&quot;Never underestimate an opponent&#39;s ability to adapt. Besides, I would only be destroying a frame of his if he was not aligned with the Weaver. An inconvenience, possibly a major one for him, but a warframe is replaceable.&quot;

Isa tilted her head a bit when Dominus brought up the thing hunting him.

&quot;That is an... interesting prospect.&quot; She turned to Disruptis. &quot;Do you think that is possible?&quot;</span>

“An abnormality hiding in a shadow. A Tenno’s shadow. An abnormality that was happy hiding itself away until it saw that it was gonna be exposed. Then it spirited away its hiding place. An abnormality created to...” he thought aloud. The Tenno pictured the nuances of the Hydroid’s reaction to the sudden shift, but it was difficult to divine reactions behind a warframe.

&quot;Assuming it wasn&#39;t a Tenno, we can rule out a host of melee weapons. Surgical tools; could go either way.&quot; Chegar chimed in, idly nodding in thought.
&quot;Actually, if our target has fled for the time being, we may have some time to do an on sight autopsy.&quot; Chegar said, looking around the room. &quot;all we need is a relatively fresh corpse, and enough time to look for trace evidence inside the cranium.&quot;

The Excalibur rose back to his feet, looking to see if there were any said fresh corpses in the area. &quot;Maybe not here, but back closer to where we met the Hydroid. He was on a tear through the facility, so if we check the bodies further back, whatever&#39;s been here might have scooped up the brains in his absense.&quot;

&quot;We noticed some Grineer further back missing their brains, yes. We could perform some more analysis on them... we had just assumed our mark of course, but that Hydroid has added in something new to factor for investigation.&quot;

Disruptis stood over the gaping hole in the floor, arms clasped behind his back and staring into its depths. He spent a few seconds in silence.

“No,” he finally responded, “...no… no, I don’t think we should leave <em>this</em> alone. Someone tell Lupin to bring down one of the brain-scooped bodies for us but… These sentients. Did you see them change forms to an almost oculyst-like suit? And then they started phasing through everything?”

They were rare, usually sticking to the backlines and loading up on battle info, until they wiped out a colony on this very planet.”</span>

Even as he worked his comms network to send Lupin the request for one of the corpses, hoping he hadn&#39;t already been attacked by something or somebody, Max was thinking behind the depths of his Warframe. Then Disruptis said something that clicked into place. Phantoms. An isolated memory, but it was there nonetheless. Of standing in front of a console with a holographic image, displaying reported and analyzed Sentient types. More shadowy figures around him, a part he couldn&#39;t remember. But he knew this much.

&quot;...Yeah. I know what you&#39;re talking about. I had a feeling they felt familiar once they started phasing out. I don&#39;t know if I ever fought them myself, but I definitely remember seeing reports of them. Maybe I fought on this planet during the Old War too.&quot;

That was reassuring, if nothing else. His memories were in there somewhere.</span>

&quot;Sounds like a Vomvalyst on steroids.&quot; Chegar said flatly, trying to recall if he had ever encountered one. He shook his head.
&quot;The tactics sound familiar. But the sentient type... I&#39;m can&#39;t remember encountering one before or not.&quot;</span>

&quot;The Grineer must&#39;ve either found a fragment we missed and woke it up, or they, and/or the Sentients themselves, have figured out how to regenerate them. Either way, this is severely problematic. The ones we&#39;re dealing with now are bad enough, another resurgence just can&#39;t be tolerated.&quot;

“All I’m saying is some Phantoms survived, and we can’t afford to let them see the light of space. Ikazu’s fragments were masters of collecting info. They compiled tons of combat data from the Old War, the likes of which boggle my mind. If the sentient Mother we’re fighting right now gained access to that... well we’d be mucked. Much less if they got the help of Phantoms in our New War.”

Disruptis waved a dismissive stump towards Dominus, adding a small “Don’t worry about it.”

“If I’m right in thinking the SED was a drone sent to harvest goods and bring them back to Weaver, I doubt she’s involved. She doesn’t micromanage her drones. I can’t tell if she could’ve known that these sentients were here, but if so then I wouldn’t be surprised if the only thing she was doing was breaking them down for parts. Weaver doesn’t like Sentients… for good reason. She definitely wouldn’t want any waking up.”

He paced the room once again in habit. “Let’s think. New facility. Extending down a deep-sea chasm on Uranus. Phantoms locked in lower levels. Substantial amounts of Hybrid Grineer. Hmmm.”

He pivoted back to the group. “Yeah, only one way I see this. Grineer digging into things they shouldn’t, yet again. This is recent, so I believe all the fragments are still here. If we wipe them out here before they make contact with their friends still chilling in the Origin system, we can stop another resurgence from happening. No trash on Hayden, but I think we can pull the brakes on this thing right now. Once Lupin returns we’re locking up and I’m going with whoever wants to rattle some Sentient bones on an extermination mission. Who’s in?”</span>

Disruptis felt a grin wrinkle the folds of his mouth, but tried to stifle it. After everything he’d been through, he held some small part of him that felt he didn’t deserve… <em>that</em>. Not yet.

“Good idea Isa, but keep them topside. We don’t want Sentients hacking an entire army of MOA against us. We’re gonna need every upper hand we can get if we’re going down there. While you’re at it, can you send a message to my orbiter? I need Coal to get me a new suit… and a gammacor that <em>won’t</em> try to kill me.”

The black and yellow Limbo rubbed his wrist as he stared into the depths of the facility. It had been years since he last fought a Sentient, but he had already begun settling into a headspace he hadn’t felt since the Old War.

If there was one thing he knew how to do: it was raiding Sentients.
