 wide beam broadcast ripples through the system, speaking to anyone that
 picks it up no matter if it’s a Grineer warship a Corpus delegate or a 
Tenno adventurer. The voice doesn’t sound like it came from the lips of a
 living soul, but it is more of a digital making that resembles the 
voice of a young man. It speaks out with a showman like vigor, each 
sylable loling off its “tongue” like a serpent.<br><br>“Hear one, hear 
all! Feeling a bit under the weather? Want to break the boring daily 
grind? Want to go fucking wild? Show off your skills maybe? Then do I 
have the thing for you! Turn those shit burning ships back round here 
and endluge yoursef in Madam Bourgoars carnival! That’s right! A 
carneval of space shanking proportions, seen first ever here near 
Pluto’s orbit. Come and experience the luxurious zoo that would have 
awed even the void assed Orokin. The entricing games, stocked with 
unique fucking prizes. Rides that will have you puking, shitting and 
screaming at the same time! If that doesn’t tickle your Tigris then drop
 down to our food courts and dip that slutty tongue of yours in our 
special dishes that will have you babbling by the end of the day.<br>So?!<br>What are you waiting for?!<br>Come down for the second best time of your life! Right behind a good morning shit.”<br><br>The message is repeated again In the Corpus and Grineer language before fizzling out.<br><br>To
 anyone curious enough, or is just looking for exactly what the 
broadcast said, then all it takes is to follow the source of the 
transmission which will lead you towards – yes, you guessed it – Pluto!

 a young man standing next to one of the many gaming booths on the 
higher levels of the enormous ship. A wide array of prizes dangle from 
the booth, plushies, bags of mystery gifts, toys, and so on. <br><br>The
 mans powerful jawed and rugged face coiling in to a teasing smirk 
causing a long scar that spans from his left eyebrow down across his 
cheek and ending at the tip of his chin, to stretch back due to the 
expression. The clerk at the booth rolls his eyes and hands him another 
loaded toy Sybaris.<br><br>The man quickly snatches it, the tiny 
movement causing a symphony of metallic jingles to ring out from him, 
caused by the many necklaces he has wearing around his neck, as well as 
the leather and fish boned leather braces that he has on both of his 
wrists.<br><br>He lifts the gun up to his scarred face, lining the 
barrel to aim at the rapidly traveling toy kavats that he has to hit for
 a prize. The motion causing his naked biceps to firm up, bulging from 
his torn and ancient sleeveless vest which at some point in it’s past 
must have been a full shirt. Nothing else covers his upper torso, 
showing his well toned and tattooed body to all the pretty ladies.<br><br>His dark brown eyes bare down the barrel of the gun, following the kavats that are made out of metal plates. <br><br>Taking
 in a deep breath, through his crooked nose, he lowers his shooting 
finger to rest against the trigger, one of his many alloy rings 
producing a low clang as he grasps it. Smiling, he starts shooting at 
the fast moving targets

                            _ _<br>But…he misses all of his three shots 
causing him to let out a loud groan and fling the gun back at the clerk.
 He lifts a hand to fix the hairband that is keeping his dreadlocked 
hair back and away from his face – a motion he does out of habit. The 
man purses his lips, determined to win a prize from this booth! So, he 
dugs his hand in to one of the many satchels and pouches that are lined 
around his hip, along with a single dagger sheet that is dangling from 
the right side.<br><br>He pulls out one piece of platinum and flings it towards the clerk, smiling<br><br>“Another one!”<br><br>---The
 level at which the young man is is littered with booth games. Shoot the
 Kavats. Pick the rotten Maprico. Roll to 100. Pretty much any you can 
imagine, they are all here. People flood the floor, all looking for fun 
and entertainment. Laughs and cries alike filling the air.---

                            ~Among the crowds of people, it would be 
hard for anyone to notice the three midget-like figures swimming through
 the throngs like fish in white water rapids. Each step for the trio was
 carefully placed- in this kind of human traffic, getting stepped on was
 always a looming threat.<br>The beings were almost like apes, or 
perhaps more like dwarves. Well, whatever they were, they were 
definitely Infested of some nature- tumor-like boils clung to their 
bodies, and fungal stalks protruded from their skin in patches all over 
their back and arms. Each creature possessed a wide, vertically-slit maw
 and two big, red, lidless, bulging eyes.<br>The tallest of the 
creatures seemed to be leading the way. The other two trailed behind it,
 babbling at each other with incoherent, guttural burps and belches.<br>The
 smallest of the three trailed behind the others, and for good reason- 
the poor thing was lugging a Synapse, the Infested equivalent of a 
taser. Normally in the hands of a human, let alone a Warframe, such a 
weapon would have little impact in terms of weight. But for such a 
petite thing, it was much, much more massive.<br>The the middle of the 
other two, there was one last monkey-like fiend. He wasn't the tallest, 
but did come close to the three's leader's height. He possessed much 
thicker limbs however, and appeared to be equivalently as strong. Over 
his shoulder was slung a bag, made of some kind of a thick cloth canvas.
 Aside from a multitude of dried bloodstains on the bag, there wasn't 
much bizarre features about it; 'twas simply something to carry prizes 
in, perhaps.<br>The three creatures continued to wade through the tides of pedestrians, eagerly looking for something.~

 At least, if the Fortuna was any indication. Still, though, after lots 
of debating with himself, here he was. On another ship. Frez was able to
 navigate the place without too much issue, knowing Corpus ship 
schematics like the back of his hand. He wore something not unlike his 
clothes on the Fortuna, civilian clothes able to hide his (honestly 
pretty ugly) face. This time, though, paranoid after the Fortuna 
incident(s), Frez had ended up taking a Cestra with him this time. Just 
in case Infested showed up. Or Grineer. Or Tenno. Man, there were a lot 
of things that could kill people, huh? Frez hardly looked threatening 
like this, though. He's too lanky to look intimidating, and the civilian
 clothes, a bit on the expensive side, didn't really help.<br>Right now,
 Frez was really looking for something to do. Nothing in particular, 
just something to waste as much time as possible. He had brought plenty 
of money with him, so that certainly wouldn't be a problem. Here's 
hoping that there would be actual vacation, and not a desperate fight 
for his life.

 worked from 9 to 5 every single day with a 1 day weekend, of which he’d
 spend doing next to nothing due to his lack of any hobbies aside from a
 mild interest in gardening. He had friends in the office, but never saw
 them outside of work hours. The 35 year old Corpus man was an empty 
husk used for business.<br><br>He had, however, always been a good shot.<br><br>Dressed
 in a sleek, white corpus suit, Stahk waited at the front of the line 
for KavatHunt™. He stood right behind a bronzed, muscular demigod who 
had played just a little too much to hold up the small line. Not that 
Stahk was in any form of rush.<br><br>The business man reached into his 
left pocket, where two magnetic balls of neodymium held fast to each 
other. He fiddled with them absentmindedly, rolling them around each 
other and pulling them apart.

                            <b>Kinsey and Rakko</b><br>Having elected to
 stash their rather somewhat imposing warframe out of sight for the time
 being, Kinsey was glad to have Rakko in the lead as the pair made their
 way through the crowd. Wearing a similar color scheme to Kinsey on her 
armor, Rakko was a female Grineer who seemed too small to be a Heavy 
Gunner but too large to fit the role of a Ballista. She towered above 
the rest of the crowd from the waist up, wading heron-like through the 
crowd on the modified stilts that currently made up the lower third of 
her prosthetic legs. Should any doubt her allegiance, she wore a 
modified Steel Meridian sigil on her shoulder. She had a white Argonak 
strapped safely to her back, slightly hidden amongst the various chunks 
of armor and prosthetics she carried. Admittedly, the stilts made Rakko 
look rather like a circus performer herself. <br><br>The two weaved 
between people as they searched the booths for any interesting games to 
participate in, chatting back and forth in Grineer.

 that the main source of light is coming from the many booths scattered 
across it. Well…that and the star mimicking bulbs that are aligned 
across the ceiling. The entire floor is covered in a rug that feels soft
 to walk on – kind of like earth after a night of rain without the mud. 
All in all, to walk through this floor is like walking through a grass 
field with a orchestra of different shining fireflies surrounding you – 
each begging for your attention. ---<br><br><u><b>Clerk</b></u><br>“Ey! You! Yeah, little ones! Come come!”<br><br>Shouted
 a man towards the little infested children. And once they turn towards 
it they will see the man that called for them sitting in a glass case 
suspended over water. A huge man at that, weighting at least 100kg over 
his prime weight, wearing a tight purple latex suit that emphasize all 
of his delicious rolls of fat. The man smiles at them through his bushy 
dark brown mustache, a warm and welcoming one as he coaxes them towards 
the booth that is titled “Dunk the Fatto”<br><br>Another clerk is 
standing beside the glass container, leaning against it with his 
shoulder. He is dressed in a pink Corpus suit but the helmet is replaced
 with a simple made bird like mask.<br><br>---Many sounds dance around 
this place, from people laughing to clerks shouting for attention. One 
such shouts, booms close to Frez---

 to the fucking test and prove it! Come and catch a apple with nothing 
but your mouth and have a chance to win a VIP ticket for the circus show
 happening at the seventh level! You know good shit happens there then!”<br><br>The
 booth from which the man shouted is more spacious than the rest with 
bright purple lights flashing above the sign that read “Mouth fishing”<br><br>---But
 wait! That’s not all! On the opposite end of the yelling clerk is a 
much calmer booth. The bright light flashing atop it read “Octavia’s 
Rush” And from his spot, Frez will be able to see the setup inside it. 
Line up against the wall of the back of the booth are wide plasma 
screens, on which ran a continuation of colors all matching a certain 
pattern that which one will find on a Octavia’s Mandachord. Since nobody
 is playing at it at the moment, the machine itself is rolling the game 
on it’s own as a display to hook in people. The clerk sitting inside has
 his head buried in his data pad which projected fast paced lights on to
 his pale and brown haired face, his brows scrunched up in complete 
focus as he tilts and moves the pad in fast jerking movements – he seems
 to be playing on the job!

                            _ _<br>--Kinsey and Rakko were coming up on a
 patch of the “exibit” that more barren than usual. On it was a very 
long vertical pole all flashing in various rapid changing lights. Bellow
 it, at it’s base is a enormous Jat Kitag resting atop a anvil. The 
bright orange light that flashed on the top of this opened booth reads –
 in all capital leathers “PROVE YOUR STRENGTH” The clerk for this booth 
is standing next to the enormous pole, his arms crossed over his chest 
as he scans the moving crowd for any interested faces.<br><br>However, 
that is not the only booth that surrounds the playful duo. On the 
opposite end of the strength game – right across it – is a face painting
 booth. Hanging from the poles beside the area are rolls of paper with 
all of the offered face painting combinations. There is a playful kubrow
 one, a kavat with whiskers. A Eidolon themed one. Some yin and yang 
fish kind of thing going on and much more.<br><br>Oh?! What's the sound?
 Near the face painting booth is another one...but with a much bigger 
crowd. The bright neon sign atop it read "Whack the larvae" The sound of
 people hitting something hard rings though this section. From what 
little they can see, people are gathered around small tables from which 
mechanical mimicks of Nidus' larvae pop out from. People try to hit them
 fast with their soft batterangs before the little rascals retreat 
inside their infested holes. Each pop-up speeding up the movement of all
 the other---

 almost naked man spat out as he lost yet another round, not really 
caring that a line has been forming behind him. He coaxed the clerk 
forwards with one if his ringed fingers and leaned over the counter to 
speak to him more privately<br><br>“So errr…seeing as how I spat out a lot of dough on his game can I…”<br><br>The
 man trailed off as he points with his eyes towards the enormous Atlas 
plushie resting in the booth. The clerk follows his gaze towards it and 
scoffs, shaking his head <br><br>“You have to win it, not my problem your aim is shit!”<br><br>The clerk spat at the man with a amused grin. The tattooed and ripped fellow frowned and pushed himself from the booth<br><br>“Khanung! This game be rigged! Here”<br><br>He
 turns around to eye the man behind him but steps to the side, somewhat 
comically bowing to him and motioning for him to step up to the booth.<br><br>“I prove it! He looks capable enough ey? If he can shoot even one down I’ll back down”<br><br>He looks back towards the man, his dark brown eyes barring down at him, waiting to see if he agrees

"Octavia's Rush" game. He was never good at that kind of stuff. And he 
may as well let the clerk play. He felt sorta out of place here, come to
 think of it. Corpus, expensive clothes, and whatnot. Eh, whatever. 
Looking around for something, he headed toward the game currently being 
played by this really salty shirtless guy. That looked pretty fun. He 
counted his credits as he walked over, confident he had plenty of money 
to afford pretty much anything. Several thousand was enough, right? He 
kept an eye out for anything even remotely threatening, as always.

the tune of the laughs. His helper – the much thinner and short man – 
stiffens his amusement and clears his throat. Pushing himself off the 
glass tank he approaches the children, along the way he grabs one of the
 alloy made balls there were on the counter of the booth. He stops a 
couple of paces from them and crouches down so to be to their eye level.

sing-song voice<br><br>“See this? Throw it to hit-“<br><br>He pauses as

ass at this!"<br><br>Rakko had squeezed her eyes shut in anticipation of
 the Tenno's grumpy onslaught, but blinked them open again when Kinsey 
announced they'd best everyone else, and she smiled as though nothing 
had happened.<br><br>The slender operator passed over the credits needed
 to play, then approached the massive hammer. They blew on their hands 
and rubbed them together, still grinning confidently. The Jat Kittag was
 absurdly oversized in Kinsey's hands, but they gripped the handle with 
practiced confidence and hefted it over their shoulder. "Let's see if I 
get called a lady after this!" they announced, swinging the hammer down 
with surprising power and accuracy, sending the slider about halfway up 
the length of the colorfully-lit game.

 concentrating on the targets’ movements and the task at hand let him

fired.<br><br><i>Bang</i>. He missed.

 A cyan runner struck out of the race. Quite a surprise for the corpus, 
but a much welcome one. He barely knew what he was doing, but the 
continued victory served to push him even further. To aim higher. To 
track the magical golden furballs at the top with a hungering gaze. He 
could see their movements whizzing past him; could feel the pattern of 
appearances beating to the sound of invisible drums. 3 shots...<br><br><i>BANG</i>. The shot went wide fr-- <i>Dingg--!</i><br><br>Stahk
 instinctively whipped to the source of the sound and shot a bell 
mounted to the booth dead-center just as it declared his time over.

clenched as he watched the shots whizz by and topple the whizzing

                            ~The trio of Infested creatures grumbled and
 growled, pushing each other with forceful shoves. The smallest of the 
three couldn't retain its balance after being pushed, and fell flat onto
 its behind. It remained seated on the ground, obviously too sad to get 
back up.<br>The muscular one went next. It gurgled triumphantly and 
began to spin the ball  on its thin, long finger. Of course, just 
because this creature was stronger looking than the rest, didn't mean 
that it was particularly more skilled. The ball tipped off of its claw 
almost instantly, rolling off to the side and becoming lost in the tides
 of people passing by.~<br><br><u>Muscular Thing:</u><br><i>Gulp.</i>

shouldn't be too hard to hit the golden one. It's fast, but not 
impossible." Frez was indeed particularly interested in the golden Kavat
 targets, and was trying to figure out how he was gonna get one of them.
 Maybe if he took a test shot or two at the slower ones, he could figure
 out how to lead the shot... "That box looks interesting, and seeing how
 hard it supposedly is to hit, there could be something good in there." 
For someone in clear civilian clothing who was very clearly sorta 
wealthy, he seemed confident in his skill with a gun.

he rigidly placed the toy sibaris down and took a look at the prizes. If
 the business man was honest with himself, he really didn’t care for any

 one,” he ended up blurting.<br><br>Then someone slung an arm around his shoulder.<br><br><br><b>???:</b><br>The clack of mechanical feet sounded off Stahk’s left.<br><br>“Aaah HA!

 glanced over to find a grinning, middle-aged corpus man in a standard 
green slim-suit, donning a thin, white coat over-top that had clearly 
been stained yellow from prolonged use. None of that registered within 
Stahk’s mind however; he was too busy feeling slightly anxious from the 
direct physical contact.

                            <b>FREZ</b><br>Well, that was unexpected. 
Glancing at the man as he was dragged away, Frez stepped up to the 
booth. Okay, he can do this. He can do this. He looked around and at the
 line behind him. He passed the clerk a few credits, enough to play once
 right now. With that dealt with, the seemingly inconspicuous Corpus 
picked up the toy replica of the Tenno weapon. He took a moment to see 
how heavy it was and how easily he could hold it, before getting a firm 
grip on the gun. Nodding at the clerk and taking a deep breath, he 
raised the toy sybaris.<br><br>When the game started, Frez worked 
quickly. He had a basic idea of how much to lead his shots from watching
 the other person playing, but still tested it on the lowest kavats. In 
only a couple of seconds, Frez had hit three of the gray kavats. Well, 
that was easy enough. Aiming up a bit, he aimed for the ones on the 
second belt, again, hitting all three shots about as fast as the gun 
could fire. Just as a Corpus crewman, he's hit faster, smaller targets 
in far more high-pressure situations. This was a carnival game. Aiming a
 bit higher again, he took aim at the purple ones. The first shot hit 
its target, but the second one flew past. His first missed shot. He had a
 few more seconds, and one last kavat.<br><br>Frez took a second to 
breath and calm down, before lining up a shot with the golden kavat. He 
took a few precious seconds to aim his sybaris, leading the fast-moving 
target by quite a bit. With only two seconds left, Frez pulled the 
trigger one last time. He held his breath, watching very intently to see
 if it would hit the prized target. The final shot sailed through the 
air, and...

bolt out of their sight as if their life depended on it. Maybe it’s for 
the better…but…the Fattoo was still thirsty.<br><br>---Once the 
announcement ranged out most of the people started flooding towards the 
lifts lined up against the North section of the floor. The three 
standard sized elevators started pooling with people, all heading down 
to the sixth floor. The little creatures will find themselves with faces
 full of butts as chaotic lines start forming in front of the elevators.
 People shoving, yelling and quite possibly hungry so the little ones 
should probably watch their step---<br><br><br><u><b>Test your strength booth</b></u> <br>Exactly two seconds after the itsy bitsy <i>tink</i>
 rights out, the entirety of the lights lined along the pole lit up with
 a even brighter display of colors, the top popping up a grand sign with
 the word “WINNER WINNER” flashing in bright neon which is accompanied 
by bright flares, a entire spectacle for the first winner at this booth!<br><br>The
 clerk looks up at the display in awe as he has yet to see anyone hit 
the bell and trigger it. However, as Kinsey exploded in to cheer the 
clerk quickly closed his mouth and looked at them, a smirk spreading 
across his face.<br><br>“Alright! Alright! You showed me! I had my doubts but…well! Congratulations!”<br><br>He
 flips on his heels and heads towards the booth that is to the right of 
the grand pole, bending down behind it he flips a switch and the entire 
show slowly starts dimming down.<br><br>The clerk stands up from behind 
the booth, holding a pink box with a cute looking mustache glued at the 
front. He walks over to Kinsey and holds it out to them<br><br>“So! As promised! The exclusive box is at your disposal! Dip your hand in and let fate decide”<br><br>He playfully winks at them at the end.

that it wasn't trying to kill him or something.<br><br>He walked off, 
carrying the plushie in one hand. Maybe he'd go check out this circus. 
He could certainly afford a ticket, right? Say what you will about the

That was odd. The Grineer had him a bit on-edge (thanks to all of that 
Corpus training), and it was just weird seeing someone so young here.

                            _ _<br>---The elevator preforms it’s duty, 
bringing the duo up to the top floor of the extravagant entertainment 
cruiser, where the hangar resided. Once the door opened they will be 
presented in to a spacious and enormous room that stretches as far as 
they can see. All of the floors ones bellow the first one are chopped up
 in to segments, not this one! This one has no walls (apart from the 
outer ones) stretching in one whole segment with the dual purpose of 
docking area for ships and at the same time being a storage for them. 
Across the entire left wall there are docking and takeoff runways which 
lead like tubes out in to the vastness of space, the end of them 
enclosed in domes for the oncoming or departing ships. There are 
mechanical rail leading from each of the runways that carry any docking 
ship on to the storing area that stretches across the entire right 
segment of the hangar. Every landing craft has it’s own spot on the 
mechanical grid that shuffles about the ships when parking or departing,
 like a huge technological manifestation of the Rubik’s cube. Every 
resident has a card or a number that has been sent to their pads upon 
docking with the exact location of their ship within the grid, once that
 information has been put in to one of the consoles that are stationed 
up in front of the elevator as well as right next to the runways, the 
grid will shuffle the landing crafts till the desired ship has been 
presented in to the runway for a easy getaway. <br><br>No more walking 
about endlessly wondering where you parked, or having to stress over 
your neighbors poor parking skills. No no, Madam Bourgoar takes care of 
all needs so that you don’t have to fret over little things such as 
these.---

save money on this trip. He didn't want to intrude, though... Then 
again, Kinsey <i>was</i> offering to let Frez go with them. Decisions were difficult... Frez hesitated before answering as he pondered this. If he <i>was</i> on vacation, it might be worth it.<br><br>"Uh...
 sure, thanks." Frez answered Kinsey finally. He didn't sound entirely 
sure, but he agreed nonetheless. He stopped walking away from the booth,
 but kept an eye on the clerk out of the corner of his eye. Seeing as 
this guy really wanted the floof, Frez was a bit suspicious. Probably 
nothing, but... He knew that people sometimes obsessed over stuff like 
this.
