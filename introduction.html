          If you wish to get a taste of the typical quality of the stories here while still giving yourself the chance to read on if you like it, then read <a href="/logs/PhantomRising/main-story-01-1.html">A Tenno's Kind of Espionage</a>. If you want to back up a little to get more of the context of the events leading up to the start of that story, give <a href="/logs/PhantomRising/side-story-02.html">Concerning Conspirations</a> a quick read first.

        <p>
          Since the official year measurements are unclear in the game, our universe uses the climactic story of the Orokin Remnant as an inflection point to count years and months. [BR] counts time Before the Remnant, [DR] counts time During the Remnant (which lasts a total of about a year), and [AR] counts time After the Remnant. The format is month/day, so 3/2 is the 2nd day of the 3rd month.
