    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">-Lua Sanctuary, Hangar Bay, Vuko&rsquo;s Scimitar-</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lt;04/2, 19:28&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c15">A few hours have passed since the official briefing, and most of the remnant have
            gone to rest, in order to prepare for the fight ahead of them. Yet some decide to spend that time...
            differently. One of those others is Vuko.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c15 c6">His scimitar was bathing in the cold lights of the hangar, darkness leaking out
            from above the open ramp, awaiting someone.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Muro wandered back into the hangar, the heavy sound of his Hydroid&#39;s footsteps
            bouncing off the walls. He had just returned from a workout in the gym, followed by a quick shower. It
            seemed to him that most everyone else in the sanctuary had gone to prepare for the oncoming mission in their
            own way. However, Muro wasn&#39;t here for that kind of mission prep. That could wait. He quickly scanned
            the line of landing craft in the hangar, looking for a certain craft. His target, a Scimitar with colors
            reminiscent of a sunset on Earth, was docked a fair distance away. Seeing it amongst the sea of other
            landing crafts, ranging from bright to pitch black, he strode in that direction, passing his own aqua-toned
            Liset on the way. Upon arriving at the craft, he went to the doorway, noticing the ramp into the craft was
            open. Reaching out, he knocked on the metal doorframe, calling to the inside of the craft.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Vuko? You in here?&quot; </span><span class="c0">He wondered if he had taken
            too long getting here.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Hey, you didn&#39;t start without me did
            you?&quot;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c8 c0">A familiar voice pierces through the veil of darkness, welcoming Muro.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~As the Hydroid enters the landing
            craft everything is dimly lit, making it almost impossible the notice anything other than a calm tangerine
            light emitted from a hologram screen where normally the navigational display is located. Right in front of
            the light source there is a pilot&rsquo;s seat in which Vuko is sitting in, browsing something on the
            screen.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You know, I said half an hour, not half a day.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He comments on his friends arrival, not bothering to stand up or even turn around to the greet
            the guest. Vuko then swipes the screen to the right, making it fade away.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;-
            &ldquo;Ide, lights.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He exclaims seemingly into nowhere, and immediately as
            the words are spoken, the inside of the ship lightens up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">~The darkness broken has revealed the rest of the room, showing off the hue of blacks
            and greys contrasted by what used to be pearl whites, but with the passage of time have turned dull, fading
            either slightly yellow or grey. Topping the palette of colors are peach metallics, detailings and lights,
            breathing a spark of life into the otherwise stoic and modernistic design. The inside of the ship is vastly
            different than a standard Scimitar, instead of a nav console with a kneeling pad there is a pilot&rsquo;s
            chair with a complete set of controls ranging from thrust throttle to axis rotation. In place of the codex
            stand there is a straight wall magnetically holding up a set of weapons, next to which Vuko&rsquo;s Ivara is
            standing, locked into the adjacent wall. What usually is the market console is a rotating seat for a
            potential co-pilot mixed with espionage equipment. All these changes do not look like they were
            replacements, but were fit into the ship from the beginning. The aesthetic of the entire cockpit does not
            differ much from the usual minimalistic tenno style, yet the hand of an Orokin designer can be seen in some
            of the details.~</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muro sighs resignedly, his head drooping a bit in a show of remorse.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;I know, I know, and I&#39;m sorry about that.&quot; </span><span class="c0">He moves
            towards the co-pilot chair, resting one hand on its back without sitting.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;I meant to be here sooner, but I wound up running into Lekalis on my way here. We
            ended up talking for a bit, so I guess I just lost track of time.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">He
            laughed nervously, realizing this was a poor excuse. Looking around the ship, he couldn&#39;t help but
            remark on the level of customization.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You know, no matter how many times I&#39;ve been in here, I can never get over
            how much detail they put into your ship. Most of the special stuff I have in mine was added after it was
            finished, and it doesn&#39;t look nearly as flashy as yours.&quot;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what killing
            tens of thousands of people used to get you during the reign of the Empire.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He responds to the awe in a voice resembling that of a worn-out canvas, remorse partially faded
            with the passage of time resonating within it. At the same time the tone in which he said &lsquo;the
            Empire&rsquo; implying a certain level of respect for the now long-gone Orokin.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Plus, I did trash my previous craft beyond any repair.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c8 c0">Vuko adds as he is getting out of the pilots seat, an awkward smile on his face as he tries to
            loosen up the tension that he created with the previous sentence, without much success.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">After
            standing up completely, he notices that Muro is within his Hydroid, and eyes him.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Oh come on. It&rsquo;s just the two of us. Drop the facade.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c8 c0">He tells him in a slightly condescending voice, as he goes towards the back of the
            aforementioned wall of weaponry. From what looks like a hidden compartment he takes out a glass carafe of
            Ostron design filled with a clear, mahogany liquid. Alongside the bottle he takes out two short, cylindrical
            glasses with a thick bottom.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He scoffed a little at Vuko&#39;s response.</span><span class="c6">&quot;Heh, I
            almost forgot how they prioritized things like that back then. Not a whole lot of glory for those who were
            supposed to keep people from dying, I suppose.&quot; </span><span class="c0">He leaned back against the
            wall, reminiscing.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Right, I remember hearing about that whole ordeal back
            then. Was that one of the assignments you and Kuve had?&quot; </span><span class="c0">Truth be told, he had
            not had the chance to work with her terribly often, as their general roles were so different. &nbsp;He
            turned his head towards Vuko, not understanding for a moment.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Oh! right,
            right.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Moving his frame into a seated position on the floor, Muro
            transferred out, standing up to his full, rather diminutive height.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">~Muro, for once was not clad in his normal Zariman suit. Rather, he was clad in a
            loose, plaintive pair of &nbsp;blue pants and a light, silvery long-sleeved shirt that extended past his
            hips, worn open.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muro eyed the carafe with interest.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Nice, secret
            compartment.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Just then he recognized the liquid within.</span><span
            class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Wait, we had that in Cetus right? When did you get it?&quot;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">When Muro
            transferred out of his frame, Vuko handed him one of the glasses, and filled it to about a third of its
            capacity with the liquid.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Yeah, the Pluto job... My old liset got shot
            down during extraction because Kuve attracted too much attention, but I wouldn&rsquo;t ask her about that.
            She will just blame it all on me and get offended for questioning her skills.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c8 c0">He chuckles during the sentence as he reminisces about the times passed, while at the same
            time he pours himself the same amount of the drink.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Yes. Yes we did. I got this
            fine bottle of daku liquor sometime between when you were freaking out about the kubrow puppies and tried to
            adopt half of them, even though they were on sale and when you were arguing with the Corpus representative
            that his belief in profit does not, in fact, make sense.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">Vuko tries to
            contain himself from laughing while remembering what Muro had done when they were in Cetus.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing your memories of that trip aren&rsquo;t that fond?&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c8 c0">He teases his friend while barely containing himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">After calming
            down and putting the carafe on a nearby counter, he raises his glass a bit wanting to bump glasses in order
            to raise a toast.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;To a successful mission!&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He exclaims in a cheerful voice, before taking a sip of the drink.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c7">Muro graciously accepts the glass, chuckling at Vuko&#39;s story.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Sounds like her. &nbsp;Kinda hard not to draw attention with that Mirage she always
            uses though.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">Muro moved to a more comfortable, cross-legged position on
            the floor, spurning the chair behind him. He made an indignant face at Vuko&#39;s teasing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Alright, first off,&quot; </span><span class="c0">He began, pointing a single
            finger with his free hand towards the ceiling, before dramatically pointing at Vuko.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Those puppies were adorable, and I didn&#39;t have any more credits on me.&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">He leaned back slightly, gazing upwards.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Besides, you
            know how my Cephalon is. She doesn&#39;t like having animals on board.&quot; </span><span class="c0">He said
            wearily. &nbsp;He tilted his head back downwards, redirecting his gaze to Vuko.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Secondly, bars aren&#39;t usually the kinds of places I would end up back in the old
            days, so I didn&#39;t really know what to do. I was only talking with that corpus because I thought it would
            be fun. It&rsquo;s just...&quot;</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;Muro fidgeted with the glass in his hand,
            seemingly embarrassed.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;I get a little carried away sometimes, you know?
            It isn&#39;t my fault that their idea of profit is so short sighted.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Muro
            huffed, recalling the arrogant way the Corpus had spoken to him.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c17" id="h.2aqj9hg77j2a"><span class="c1"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muro&#39;s expression then softened a bit, while he reflected on the trip as a
            whole.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t say the trip was bad or anything. Just a little
            overwhelming in some ways.&quot; </span><span class="c0">He laughed a little at the irony. Here he was, a
            kid who was perfectly fine being shot at by dozens of heavily armed combatants simultaneously, and a loud
            social situation was putting him off his balance. Noting Vuko&#39;s offer of toast, he leaned forward,
            clinking his glass against Vuko&#39;s.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;To a successful mission.&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">He said, more quietly. He put the glass up to his lips, taking only the smallest sip
            before his face shriveled up in disgust.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Blech.&quot; </span><span
            class="c6 c7">He looked downward towards the dark liquid, his face contorting in revulsion.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot; I still don&#39;t get why you like this stuff so much.&quot; </span><span
            class="c6 c7">upon saying that, a thought that had been nagging Muro since the trip resurfaced with a
            vengeance. Adopting a more neutral, albeit curious expression, &nbsp;Muro looked up from his drink toward
            Vuko.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Hey, speaking of not understanding something, could you explain
            something to me? What exactly happened between you and that Loki we were with today?&quot; </span><span
            class="c0">His head tilted sideways , trying to remember his name.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;You
            know, umm.... Strider, I think? I know how you act when you&#39;re mad, and something&#39;s obviously
            bugging you about him, so what is it?&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Muro leaned farther forward intently,
            cradling the now largely forgotten drink in his hands, &nbsp;waiting eagerly to hear the tale.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He chuckles
            at Muro&rsquo;s remark of Kuve using the flashiest of warframes, despite being a stealth operative. He
            follows in his friends steps and sits down on the floor with one leg lying straight and the other bent in
            the knee, foot close to him.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I took you there, we
            longer have </span><span class="c6 c18">him</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">breathing
            down our necks, so you&rsquo;ve got to learn to live. Besides, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you reached the legal
            drinking age sometime over the past couple hundred years.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">He says with a
            cheeky smile on his face, as he takes a sip of the drink.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">When Muro
            speaks of the Loki, the smile is immediately wiped off of Vuko&rsquo;s face, replaced by a somewhat
            unpleasant grimace.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I have my suspicions about him. I&rsquo;m not a
            hundred percent sure he is who I think he is, but... if I am right...&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He
            says in a worried voice and once again drinks the liquor, this time taking a big gulp, emptying the
            glass.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s time I told you the story of me and the
            Loki...&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">He takes a deep breath, and begins the tale.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;I will spare you the
            unnecessary details that lead me to making such decisions, you just need to know that I was struggling with
            a lot of hard questions and where I stand on them. Well, I still am, but that&rsquo;s besides the point. It
            all started with a simple assignment of eliminating a rebel cell.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;The task proved much harder
            than anticipated, all thanks to a Loki, who stepped in as I was halfway done eliminating the targets. He is,
            or rather was, one of the few people who could take me head on.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muro paused for a moment, connecting the dots of the story. Vuko&#39;s worried tone
            was off-putting, to say the least. As far as Muro could remember, the only people that could stand a chance
            against Vuko on their own were Mata, and perhaps some of the other Veiled Tenno. Still, there were some
            things he was confused about.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;This was a job from the old days,
            wasn&#39;t it? Sure sounds like the kind of work they had you do.&quot; </span><span class="c0">His eyes
            widened, understanding what Vuko was implying.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Oh, so you think the Loki
            from back then and this Strider guy are the same person?&quot; </span><span class="c0">Muro shrugged, not
            understanding what was bothering him so much about this.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;If you
            aren&#39;t sure, why not just ask him? I spent most of that trip following him around and he seemed like a
            good guy. A little weird, sure, but that&#39;s kind of normal for us, isn&#39;t it? Besides, even if he is
            the same Tenno from back then, then that just means we have another powerhouse on our side!&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">He gestured grandly with one hand, excited at the prospect of having such a powerful
            ally. He stopped the gesture halfway through, returning to a calmer, more concerned stance. Vuko wasn&#39;t
            the type to get this concerned about anything, much less one person, so there was probably a good reason for
            it.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s... more to this, isn&#39;t there?&quot; </span><span
            class="c8 c0">He asked, quietly.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask him... if
            only it was that simple.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He chuckles sarcastically.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand once I finish the story. And yes it was... quite a long
            time ago. Back when those cells started to spiral out of control.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">Vuko
            takes a moments to rest and recall the rest of the tale.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;After the first encounter I
            kept bumping into him time and time again. We fought. A lot. Every time I had anything to do with the rebels
            he was there. Their guardian angel.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He takes the bottle and pours himself
            more liquor, this time a full glass.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;For over a year I hadn&rsquo;t
            successfully completed a single task concerning the rebellion. Always because of him. When I look back at it
            now, it makes more sense than it did then.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He takes a sip of the drink and
            takes a few seconds to rest.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;He was trying to teach me a lesson. A
            lesson about the empire, and how rotten it was. He kept showing me what they stand for, their morals, their
            goals, and most importantly their passion to make the system a better place.... And it worked. I started
            doubting. Questioning. But there were no answers.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Wow. I, I never knew.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Muro sat there, awed by
            Vuko&#39;s story. Thinking back, even when this must have been going on, Vuko never said anything about it.
            Still, something bothered him.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp; &quot;If this was going on, why didn&#39;t you
            tell me? I&#39;m sure the two of us could have handled this guy, whoever he was.&quot; </span><span
            class="c0">Muro himself was rarely called on for assignments of this sort, as he was more often used to hold
            defensive positions and act as a bodyguard/monitor for high-priority individuals, usually chosen by Ballas.
            As a result, he never had the occasion to deal with the rebel element in the Orokin empire, at least not in
            a direct combat situation. Muro&#39;s expression darkened when Vuko mentioned his doubts and questions, all
            too familiar concerns bubbling to the surface of his own mind. However, he said nothing, waiting for him to
            continue.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;I... didn&rsquo;t want help.
            I wasn&rsquo;t fooling myself with the idea that I could defeat him without any help, nevertheless, I kept
            coming up with excuses as to why I needed to handle this myself. All that, because deep down I knew he was
            right.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He admits to Muro, as well as to himself, as over the years he came
            to truly understand what was happening then.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Over the next few months
            he burrowed himself into my mind even deeper. Not literally of course, I mean his ideals.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c0">He frantically waved his free hand as if he actually wanted to blow away any weird
            theories about mind control or anything similar.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;We started talking.
            In secret of course. His words, reasoning, it all was just. I believed in everything he said, it was like I
            finally opened my eyes to all the horrific things that I was doing. It made me mad at the Empire. It made me
            want to...&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">Vuko takes a moment to finish the sentence, almost like it pains
            him to actually finish what he was saying.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;...want to join
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">As Vuko spun his story, Muro could almost feel a vice gripping his own heart. What
            Vuko was suggesting was treason, pure and simple. Knowing that, it wasn&#39;t at all surprising to Muro that
            he kept quiet about it. Ballas was known to them for many things, but kindness and understanding were not
            among them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say Vuko. That&#39;s... kind of a lot to take
            in.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">At the moment, Muro&#39;s own mind was spinning through his own memories; a
            garishly colored procession of cruelty and indulgence. How many atrocities had he seen the Orokin elite
            endorse, or carry out themselves? How many servants ordered to be brutally murdered for the most
            insignificant error? He knew well the corruption of the empire, but rebellion never even occurred to him as
            a possibility. After all, they still had Margulis, and even Muro could deduce what would happen to her if
            her &quot;children&quot; rebelled. What&#39;s more, Muro still had his de facto family in the Remnant. Then
            and now, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to put them at risk, even if it meant ignoring the suffering of
            millions more. Amidst this cascade of memories, certain past events began to resurface, illuminated by this
            new information. He turned his questioning back to Vuko, his tone conveying disbelief.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait, was this why you left the rest of us when we were recalled to Lua? Did
            Kuve know about all of this? Why would you tell her and not me?&quot;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to
            burden you. I was confused myself. Didn&rsquo;t know what the right choice was anymore.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c0">He tried explaining his actions, but his arguments were lackluster at best, almost like
            Vuko didn&rsquo;t believe in what he was saying.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;As to Kuve&hellip;
            well&hellip; she was in the thick of it from the very beginning. There really isn&rsquo;t anything we talk
            about. I hope you understand.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">As the Tenno finished trying to excuse
            himself, he pointed his head downwards, as if in shame, and began to twirl the liquid inside the glass by
            delicately shaking it in a circular motion.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Silence
            ensued, as Vuko let the information sink in, while he continued to play with the liquor. After a minute or
            two, with the intent of breaking the silence, he took a sip of the alcohol, and went on to talk about the
            past.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Going back to what you are here for. The story. Well&hellip; I
            went ahead with it. I was planning my defection. I tried to convince Kuve to go with me, but she refused
            time and time again. The idea of leaving the family scared me, but I saw no other choice&hellip;
            zaraza&hellip; it all felt like I was in a nightmare, no real control, no choice, I could only run forward.
            So I did.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">His voice started growing in desperation, as if he was reliving
            it all over again.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">- &rdquo;It was supposed to be our last meeting like this. Mine and Lekalis&rsquo;.
            We were polishing up on some details on how to make sure the Empire couldn&rsquo;t track my ship once I went
            dark. I have no idea how, I covered my tracks perfectly, made sure absolutely no one knew about this, did
            everything to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t followed, but Sigyn found out about it. There was an ambush. More
            than 20 Dax Soldiers. I thought I was done for. In all the scenarios that rushed through my head in none I
            came out of it in one piece. If I tried fighting back I would have been instantly gunned down. If I gave up
            Ballas would have made an example out of me, made my life worse than any hell I could imagine. I really
            though my life was over.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">His speech was picking up pace as he went along
            with it, Vuko getting visually nervous as he neared the conclusion.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;-
            &ldquo;Then what seemed like impossible happened. All of the soldiers went after Lekalis. Restrained him.
            Took him. But not even a single one approached me. I had no clue what was happening. Until she approached
            me. I will never forget what happened next. As the Dax were dragging him away, Sigyn came up to me, winked,
            and said: &lsquo;Good job on infiltrating the rebels. I&rsquo;m sure Ballas will be pleased to hear about
            the results.&rsquo; And then she left like nothing had ever happened. I was awestruck. I did not know what
            to do next. For the first time in my life I was truly lost.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">At this point, Muro didn&#39;t know what to feel. Looking back, he remembered
            nothing of these events, nor the cover up that Sigyn apparently orchestrated. Just how out of the loop was
            he? How could he be so blind to the turmoil that had engulfed someone he saw as his brother? As Vuko
            recounted his story, Muro considered the other actors here. How much did they really know about all this? He
            had long since considered Kuve&#39;s motives to be unknowable to him, but did Sigyn really put herself on
            the line for Vuko? Muro doubted that Ballas would have allowed such a thing, even under the guise of an
            undercover op. Muro&#39;s jaw was set. Where was he in all this? &nbsp;His eyes burned slightly as he choked
            out an apology.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Vuko, I... I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be there when you needed
            help.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Muro bowed his head towards the floor, unable to meet Vuko&#39;s
            gaze.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize. I
            could have told you about back then, and I didn&rsquo;t. You had enough problems yourself.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c0">He finishes the sentence with a loud &lsquo;sigh&rsquo;, lifting a stone off his
            chest.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you all this because you deserve to know.
            &nbsp;- </span><span class="c0">He takes the a sip of liquor, leaving the glass at a third full.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;And to clarify, this is not common knowledge. The only people that know about it
            are the involved parties, which is Sigyn and Lekalis plus Kuve. Not even Mata knows about this, and I would
            like it to stay that way.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">Vuko puts the glass on the floor next to him,
            stands up and goes over to the pilot seat and puts his hands on the back of said seat, and goes on to talk,
            with his back facing Muro.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Enough about my struggles. Those are mine,
            and for me to face alone. We need to focus about here and now.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He turns
            back around to look at his brother, now leaning against the seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">- &ldquo;This brings me to the second reason I&rsquo;m telling you this, my concern
            about the Loki. From what I told you it would seem like he should be an ally, but after his capture...
            something changed. I longer had any missions with rebels, and I was tasked with more espionage instead.
            Ballas had me follow around some Dax soldier, I can&rsquo;t really bother to remember his name but it was
            something about him committing treason... But that&rsquo;s besides the point. It bugged me that I was put on
            the sidelines, especially with all news about Lekalis being covered in layers of red tape, and security
            clearance so high I&rsquo;m pretty sure only executors could access it. So I started digging. What I found
            was... concerning. To say the least. I found out that there apparently was someone else who took my spot in
            destroying rebel outposts. My mind boggled with the idea who could be more fitting than me, so I decided to
            contact some rebel sources. From them I found out that apparently there was a crazed Loki out and about, who
            once was allied with the rebellion but now is eliminating them with deadly efficiency. That&rsquo;s when I
            put two and two together. I heard rumours of what can happen to rogue Tenno. The Empire would break them.
            Piece by piece. Both physically and mentally...&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He takes a deep breath and
            continues.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I suspect happened to him. I think they
            broke him. He might not even know who he is anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">-&ldquo;That is why I don&rsquo;t trust this Loki that joined us. If my concerns are
            accurate and that is him, we have no idea whose side he is on. And if he won&rsquo;t turn on us simply
            because some kind of trigger goes off.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">He finishes the sentence with a
            worried tone</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Muro lifted his head slightly, watching Vuko as he stood and changed position. It
            surprised him that Mata himself didn&#39;t know of this, as their apparent leader. He did remember that
            there was a point where he started seeing Vuko much more often. In fact, the job he described involving the
            Dax soldier was indeed very similar to what Muro himself was often tasked to do. While he was relieved to
            see Vuko around, he remembered even then that Vuko was all in all a poor fit for those kinds of assignments,
            which was what got him jobs out on the fringes of the system in the first place. Amidst this reminiscence,
            Muro&#39;s heart sank as Vuko explained his theory of what happened to this worthy opponent. They both knew
            all too well what would happen to rogue Tenno. As it stood they were too valuable an asset to the empire to
            simply be destroyed. No, it would be better to torment them, break the mere children that opposed them until
            they would start following orders. Muro clenched his fists in rage.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Damn them... So you&#39;re saying that Lekalis is a ticking time bomb? If he
            manages to snap back to what he used to be, there&#39;s no way of knowing what he&#39;ll do, right?&quot;
        </span><span class="c0 c8">Muro&#39;s laced his fingers together and brought them against his forehead, racking
            his brain to try and figure a way to solve this. From what he saw, the Loki he met was a good person, as far
            as he could tell. Maybe a little strange, but from everything Vuko had told him so far, it was
            justifiable.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;I... I don&#39;t want him hurt, if we can help it. You two seemed to have some
            kind of understanding back then, so maybe, if the time comes, you can try and talk sense into him.&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t much of an idea, but it was all Muro had.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;If we can make him understand that version of him understand that we aren&#39;t his
            enemies and we had nothing to do with what happened to him, maybe that will at least stop him from trying to
            kill us outright.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">His tone was skeptical, but still somewhat
            hopeful.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure
            talking won&rsquo;t help. We could try it however. For the sake of your peace of mind.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He takes a deep breath, as if to prepare Muro for the worse.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;-
            &ldquo;But I need you to be ready. Be ready to help me take him down when the time comes. I can&rsquo;t do
            it by myself.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">Vuko takes a few steps forward, placing himself in front of
            Muro, takes a knee, and place his hands on his shoulders.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Can I count
            on you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muro laughed, just a singular, coarse guffaw.</span><span
            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Always.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">He didn&#39;t relish the idea of turning his
            weapons on an ally, &nbsp;but if it came to it, Muro was more than ready to defend family. Muro would have
            continued, but suddenly a familiar voice filled the cabin, making use of the speaker within Muro&#39;s
            Hydroid.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Muro, I&#39;ve finished with the Orbiter purge. You can come back now, if
            you&#39;d like. However, If you don&#39;t mind, I have a few things I want you to...&quot; </span><span
            class="c0">At this moment, &nbsp;the voice pauses, seemingly realizing where their operator was, as well as
            their current company.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Ah, Vuko, darling! It&#39;s been eons! How have
            you been? &nbsp;How&#39;s your socially stunted Cephalon?&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Her voice was
            cheerful, talking as if they were all meeting over tea. Muro blushed slightly, embarrassed by his
            Cephalon&#39;s general lack of tact.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Aurelia! Read the room, will ya?&quot; </span><span class="c0">Muro said,
            visibly flustered</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;And I thought I told you not to talk through my
            Warframe like that! It creeps people out!&quot; </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;He turned back towards Vuko, a
            mixture of embarrassment and irritation on his face.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Well, if she&#39;s
            coming after me, I should probably get going. Just let me know when you&#39;re ready to talk to him.&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">In a brief moment, Muro transferred back into his frame and began to head for the exit.
            Before he reached it, however, he paused, turning towards Vuko once again.</span><span
            class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;To be honest, I think getting all this out in the open will be good for all of
            us.&quot;</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ide:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c0">Unexpectedly, a passive-aggressive voice starts ringing throughout the ship, in response to what
            came out of Muro&rsquo;s warframe.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;M FINE. AND WHAT DO YOU
            CARE ALL OF THE SUDDEN. HMPH.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">The cephalon says accusingly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Ide, what&rsquo;s gotten
            into you! First you don&rsquo;t want to talk to me at all, and now you&rsquo;re shouting at Aurelia?! She at
            least is being kind and supportive!&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He responds to his
            cephalon.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine Aurelia, thank you for asking.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ide:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OH! So it&rsquo;s all my fault
            now?! And how dare you compare that bitch to me?!&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">She shouts back to the
            Tenno.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;HOW DARE YOU JUST LEAVE FOR HALF A MILLENNIUM IN SOME DUSTY OLD
            HANGAR LIKE I&rsquo;M A DISPOSABLE OBJECT!!&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">The screaming of the cephalon
            making the entire scimitar tremble.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &ldquo;AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU RAN OFF
            WITH THAT PINK HAIRED BIMBO!!!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c12">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T YOU DARE TALK
            LIKE THAT ABOUT KUVE! NOT NOW. NOT EVER. OR I SWEAR TO THE VOID I WILL CRASH YOUR IDIOTIC CEPHALON BRAIN
            INTO THE SUN!&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He continues the screaming competition. Vuko turns on his
            feet towards Muro, steam fuming from his nostrils.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Khkhkm. Now would
            be the perfect time to go.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He says in the calmest way he can, which right
            now sounds kinda aggressive.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Through hijacking Muro&#39;s speakers for a moment, Aurelia managed a
            courteous-sounding response.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;A pleasure as always, Ide dear. Glad to see you haven&#39;t lost a step in all
            these years.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">From within his frame, Muro wasn&#39;t sure if Aurelia was being sincere or not.
            Being honest, he was never any good at telling when she was spewing decency or veiled derision. Regardless,
            he knew he had to stop her before she went too far. He was good at shrugging off her snide comments, but he
            had a feeling Ide wouldn&#39;t be as accommodating.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Aurelia, can
            you stop poking her please? I think you&#39;ve done enough.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">The only
            response he received was a satisfied &quot;hmph.&quot; It would have to do.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">&#39;There he goes again&#39;, she thought to herself, &#39;assuming the worst of
            me.&#39; &nbsp;At least Vuko still had some manners, a fact she greatly appreciated. that satisfaction began
            to melt away however, as the the shouting match between Vuko &nbsp;and his Cephalon heated up. Both Muro and
            Aurelia could only linger there, enraptured as the two of them screamed at each other with unexpected fury.
            As Vuko gave them the calmest sign she thought he could manage that they should leave, Aurelia whispered to
            Muro, her voice losing some of its own cool confidence.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;He may be right, Muro. We should probably leave. Now would be
            good.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Muro could only nod mutely to Aurelia&#39;s suggestion, giving Vuko a slight bow
            before walking quickly out of the ship. Whatever was going to happen next, he was sure he wanted nothing to
            do with it. As he gained more distance from the Scimitar, which, upon looking back, he swore he could see
            heat waves emanating from, his stride slowed, his feet leading him back to his own Liset. Thinking back for
            a moment, he remember what brought Aurelia to the party in the first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;So, uh, you said you had stuff you wanted me to get for home?&quot;
        </span><span class="c8 c0">He could almost feel the conversational whiplash Aurelia was experiencing with that
            question, but he needed to get the awkward burden of what they just left off his shoulders.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Still slightly-off balance by that awkward social situation, Muro&#39;s sudden
            question was rather jarring. Within a moment or two, she managed to compose herself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, actually. It&#39;s a just a few things. That Cetus place I&#39;ve read
            about seems like it has some interesting d&eacute;cor that could help the bearer parts of the Orbiter while
            I get the plants that died replaced. Speaking of that, there are few plant species that I don&#39;t
            currently have the seeds for that I simply must have for the planters near the Transference room.
            They&#39;re mostly on Earth, so they should be easy enough for you to find later on.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c9">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Muro nodded along to her list. Ever the perfectionist, not that he didn&#39;t
            appreciate the results. Aurelia paused for a moment, a rare occurrence for her once she had gotten into one
            of her diatribes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You know, essentially having to redo all the work I had done to make that
            Orbiter look presentable seems to be a small price to pay for getting to, in essence sleep through those
            centuries while you were out. What I&#39;m trying to say is... Thank you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10">Muro:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;Oh. Um, you&#39;re welcome, I guess. Well, might as well get started on those
            errands. Send me the coordinates for the first location, if you would.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Muro
            heard what sounded like Aurelia clearing her throat, before donning a more professional, yet happy
            tone.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aurelia:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course, Operator. The first set of coordinates have been uploaded to the
            Liset. Best of luck.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
