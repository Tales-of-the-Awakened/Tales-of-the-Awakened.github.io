      ><span class="c3 c14">Devros von Inie</span
      ><span class="c14"
        ><br />Lua has always been one of those places that is in a constant
        state of mystery. No matter how many times you drop down on the pale,
        barren surface, it still feels like the very first time. Remnants of a
        glorious empire litter it&#39;s surface like a forgotten memory, and yet
        feel so familiar that it almost sparks a sentiment of home. Back in its
        glory days it was once a powerhouse of activity and now only the
        occasional whisper of a breeze keeps the halls company. It&#39;s quite
        sorrowful to see what war does&hellip;then again, war is what drives the
        cogs.<br />He knew this palce long before the collapse or the freeze. He
        remembers the time his father was called for research and brought the
        family along for a trip. It was very lively back then, and very vibrant.
        Now you can almost feel the ghosts coiling around shattered pillars and
        crumbling rooms, their wails but a silent cry of what once was.<br /><br />Many
        say that curiosity kills you, and while most are right there are some
        that dare be driven by it. Where is the fun if you don&#39;t go knocking
        on hels door every once in a while? Devros is a guy of many quirks,
        while many pull towards the negative side there are some that make
        him&hellip;strange. Curiosity is one of those strange quirks, and while
        it brought him in to some deep toruble it also build up his judgment.<br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c12"
        >A Scimitar, painted in reflecting silver and dull red, lowers upon a
        destroyed landing pad on Lua. Upon opening, it&#39;s not a warframe that
        steps out, but a boy in a helmless Verida suit. The colors somewhat
        mimicking the kuva guardians palette with black sleeves, red accents and
        a light sand like primary color to blend it all together. The boy has
        spiked dark hair and greenish golden eyes that hide behind busted and
        old glasses. Stepping forward, he takes a deep breath, stretching out
        and popping his bulky physique from the discomfort of the travel.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c15 c8"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c15">
      <span class="c12"
        >A low whine comes from behind the boy which causes him to smirk and
        look over his shoulder to a bulky kubrow that is almost as tall as he
        is.<br /><br />&quot;Come now Garhul, don&#39;t ya worry, I&#39;ll be
        dandy.&quot; He says in a firm and husky voice, followed by a strange
        accent.<br /><br />The companion responds with a huff and trots to stand
        beside his master, rubbing his heavy and broad head against the boys
        side which almost knocked Devros off balance. Letting out a chuckle he
        rubs the kubrows head and looks ahead, to the destroyed outpost.<br /><br />&quot;If
        they wanted meh dead I&#39;d probably be already. Besides, bringing a
        frame is not very friendly. How&#39;d ye like it if some stranger came
        with a Opticor in yer home?&quot;<br /><br />The kubrow ruffles his fur
        and looks at Devros with dim yellow eyes and a
        are-you-fricking-kidding-me-right-now face. The boy chuckles at his
        companions expression and adds<br /><br />&quot;Better than a Lenz,
        eh?&quot;<br /><br />Devros smiles and starts walking ahead, to what he
        concluded - after days of code breaking - &nbsp;to be the source of the
        strange message and the epicenter of the disappearing tenno. He might be
        walking in to certain death without a frame or a amp by his side, but
        it&#39;s a risk he is willing to take if he is to show them that he
        comes in peace and not to pick a fight. Getting sniped from afar is not
        really the way he wants to die, it&#39;s in fact one dumbest ways to go.
        And there is Garval, who is more than capable of dealing with grineer
        and corpus stragglers if the threat arises. Driven by the desire to
        figure out what&#39;s happening in this place, he continues on ahead,
        hoping that he doesn&#39;t end up in a ditch somewhere as soon as he
        steps foot near the sanctuary.<br /><br />Garhul, follows close to
        Devros and keeps on high alert, tilting his ears to the slightest sound
        and keeping his nose open to any strange smells.</span

        bodies and weapons littering the floor, accompanied by blood stains in
        random splotches on the walls and floor. The walk is not a terribly long
        one, and ends in a room with four pillars and a broken Orokin console on
        the other side of the room at the edge of the platform~<br />(think lua
        challenge with the giant floating eye orb thing)</span

        >He wasn&rsquo;t scared of what might find him, in fact he felt
        excitement boiling up from the pit of his stomach at the promise of
        experiencing something else apart from war and blood. He carefully
        advances past the decaying corpses, eying their weapons with regal
        glances, counting the bodies and guns as if to make sure that everything
        is accounted for. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to have someone running around
        with one of those guns eh? Everything must have a pair. He shoots his
        companion a glance and smirks at his seriousness and alertness.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes
        yes, it seems that there is activity &lsquo;ere&rdquo; He seems to muse
        to himself<br /><br />Garhul wasn&#39;t as cool and collected as the boy
        and was very much on suspense once the bodies came. He sniffs the air
        and walks on light steps a few paces in front as if to make sure there
        are no traps or enemies to threaten Devros.<br /><br />After what seemed
        to be a very light stroll came the spacious room with the broken
        console.<br /><br />&ldquo;Too open. Back, back&rdquo;<br /><br />A
        voice whizzed past his mind but he pushed it back and shook his head to
        clear it. He scans the room through his optics and eyes his companion
        who is already near the console which usually means that it&rsquo;s
        safe.<br /><br />Smirking he follows suit and stops in front of the
        broken contraption, eying it. Lifting a hand he lightly brushes it along
        the console as if hoping that it would open some hidden passage or spark
        a challenge.</span

        spoke up. The boys ears perked up and he stood in place for a moment as
        a curious smirk graced his lips. Finally someone arrives. Straightening
        up, he gracefully twirls on his heels to face the doorway once more
        &ndash; a action &nbsp;that might make him look as if he&rsquo;s a lost
        tap dancer that is about to ask for the nearest toilet. Devros lifts a
        hand and puts it on Garval&rsquo;s raised hackles, while his golden eyes
        scan the darkness for clues of the speaker</span

        almost completely.</span

      ><span class="c0"
        >Satisfied with his companions reaction, he turns his attention back
        towards the darkness. With a curious grin on his face and a calm aura,
        he says with his husky voice - his accent seeming vanished and replaced
        by a more formal way of speaking</span

        ><br /><br />&ldquo;Well&hellip;we wear our warframes in needs of

        signs of movement that would indicate the speakers location. Garval
        seems to do the same, his ears rotating on his head like satellites and
        his nose flaring &ndash; searching for a scent to track down</span

        approaching this situation. Devros is a strong believer in the head
        first approach cause it goes around all of the silly things that come
        with being careful &ndash; at least things are more fun this way. The
        boy brandishes many scars that show off the many results of this
        approach, but even if one day he &nbsp;ends up without a arm or a leg
        cause of this he will probably keep walking in to every situation
        without a care about his wellbeing until he is but a puddle on a wall
        somewhere. &nbsp;Once again he changes his way of speaking, the
        formality flying away somewhere as if he never spoke it and in
        it&rsquo;s place comes a more gruff voice and a accent that sounds like
        it belongs to old Earth.</span

        Garval protests to the command with a grunt, but still obeys and stays
        in place, watching the shadows for more danger and especially a close

        Devros fears that Mataeru doesn&rsquo;t know of the predicament most of
        the Tenno were put in since the awakening. Sure, Lotus is shady and her
        ways are the ways of a warlord but there is no denying it that she was a
        rock for a lot of Tenno. Then again, Mataeru had wandered along for
        decades so he&#39;s had it worse</span

        >The book he picked up seemed to be a something of a history of the Dax
        soldiers. Devros always found their order interesting, part cause it was
        very loyalty driven and part cause of their elite skills in battle. Ever
        since he met Teshin he&rsquo;s been fascinated by them&hellip;but Teshin
        isn&rsquo;t a talkative fellow &ndash; and even when he does he insists
        on talking in very vague phrases or riddles. EH! Now that he has found
        this library he can read to his hearts content and fill his mind with
        stories.<br /><br />Devros twitched in surprise when Mataeru stepped
        closer cause he was so occupied by the book that he barely noticed the
        other step so close. Lifting his head, he looks at Mataeru and with a
        pleased smile, nods.</span

        looks at his companion that&rsquo;s found a temporary home in front of
        the fireplace, obviously enjoying the cozy warmth of the fire by laying
        down in to a huge ball of fur, almost obstructing the view of it
        entirely. Rolling his eyes, he brings them back at Mataeru and lifts the

        interesting. He then looks back at the bookshelf and greedily eyes the
