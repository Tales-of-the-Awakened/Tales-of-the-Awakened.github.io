        signal fluttered, faintly like the battering of an insect&rsquo;s wings
        against glass, against the one familiar presence it could reach. Despite
        its weakness, a thread of strength pulsed in the way it continued. A
        shred of lodestone amongst iron shavings, or a planetary polestar
        visible only in one&rsquo;s peripheral vision. It was wordless in its
        searching, a silent reaching that hummed </span

        >With a wandering curiosity, Lekalis&#39; Mantis burst into the thick
        cloud of debris orbiting Eris. The daybreak hue glimmering off battered
        holes and porous flesh alike as the Mantis drifted forward.<br />Scrap
        bounced off its reddish hull as it loomed forward, molding growths tried
        to cling to it but were brushed away with the odd but tactile bumps
        against larger sections of junk.<br /><br />Inside, Lekalis sat;
        piloting his vessel in the dark interior, his hands flitting about amber
        holographic controls. Occasionally, the vessel shook as the strangled
        heart of a generator further back in his Mantis propelled the vessel
        forward, entering the denser and corpse ridden atmosphere of Eris.<br /><br />Triangulating
        the source of this fluttering signal was difficult enough, let alone
        having to navigate the debris without aide... Now he had to pin-point
        it. He wished to reach out and simply pull along some string, some
        better sign... But this distant ripple was all he had.<br />He supposed,
        as he felt the sun warm the hull of his vessel, that it was like
        fishing... <br /><br />... That was good, at the least. Soothing, as he
        felt his fingers relax, the legs of his Mantis flexed and flowed through
        the debris as he followed this ripple on the lake of dead data that
        surrounded Eris.<br />He came as close as he could wager, before slowing
        where that pulse had emanated from. Some thousands upon thousands of
        meters &nbsp;down, something was buried.<br /><br />It was here that he
        let his vessel stabilize, finding a groove in the wreckage and sinew
        laden net of Infestation, here he cast his line.<br /><br />He shut his
        unseen eyes and reached out in kind to this distant but familiar
        echo.<br />Lekalis meditated, surrendering control of his vessel for a
        moment to try and pinpoint just where... Even what this buried signal
        lay.</span

        >&nbsp;thrumming along its taut string. The Infestation itself shied
        away from overgrowing what might be an opening into a deeper cave
        system, the reason clear from the wafting of super-chilled air drifting
        out from the broken seal. <br /><br />Blindly, the signal continued to
        broadcast, though the mental reflection of the pleasant sun-warmed hull
        had it leaning into the presence like a touch-starved kubrow. Wary, but
        wanting the connection all the same, the way a river slowly seeped in to
        fill a wound carved into its side.~</span

        spine as the warmth came through, the ship lilted and abruptly clanged
        against a shard of hull that&#39;d been blasted off by some forgotten
        conflict.<br /><br />It sent chunks of rubedo and junk and herbs
        clattering across the floor, The Strider with it, was knocked out of his
        meditative stance for a moment before he scrambled into the piloting
        dias and resumed control of the vessel. He shook his head and quickly
        locked into the tug of the void.<br /><br />For once, he didn&#39;t feel
        lost as he led his ship closer and closer to the surface of Eris.<br /><br />At
        last, he found an outcropping of flesh and steel close enough to the
        caves that he could plant his Landing Craft on. The legs turned and dug
        into the meat, curling inwards like a bug to perch on a stick.<br /><br />The
        Strider was eager, and he swiftly slid out of the Mantis, decked out in
        his gear; he flicked the broken prongs of his horn, as if for good luck.
        He sighed, the vents clicking open and shut, immediately misting into
        the frosty air. Though, also vaporizing instantly as the lack of
        Life-Support quickly began to tick down his shields.<br /><br />At a
        quick jog, he began to navigate deeper into the cave system, on foot.

        it was the closest he had to a trail...</span

        prying and picking of the Infestation outside. A console, blinking
        cheerfully in open-access green, sat beside the gleaming Orokin door as
        it stood, blithe sentinel to whatever lay within.<br /><br />The signal
        faltered as it lost friction on whatever it had found in Lekalis&#39;s
        presence, the first indication of mortality and fallibility in the
        signal&#39;s source; it resurged, returning to constancy, but the

        and planted a palm on it, hoping to initiate some means of

        seal had done its work, leaving the elevator and whatever it led to

        breathing did when it hit bitingly cold water, the hurt drowning in ice
        and chilled air. It was controlled, then, brought to heel by whatever

        behind him, his eyes scanning his sensors for any sign of other
        Warframes or the Lotus... Presuming he found none, he relaxed and looked
        on and moved towards the apparent freight elevator. <br /><br />He
        looked about for a means to initiate its descent as he made to stand at

        squarely in the center of the lift. A descent began, automatic and slow
        in its start though it picked up in speed until the brakes re-engaged,
        slowing the descent jerkily as the system&#39;s age betrayed itself.
        <br /><br />The door to the chamber itself, however, opened just as
        smoothly as the first door to the elevator itself. Dim lights flickered
        on, only slowly increasing their brightness in consideration for the
        slow acclimatization of the eyes. A scantily gilded Orokin cryo-stasis
        pod took center-stage, surrounded by an impressive assortment of
        surgical equipment sets and examination tables. Most of them were dulled
        only by the settling of dust, but a few had begun to rust under a few
        dried pools of Void-touched blood.<br /><br />In the shadow of the pod,
        the faintest of orange glows strengthened to the pulse of a heartbeat, a
        nebulous but no less powerful presence unfurling itself to support the
        signal source, the Tenno still imprisoned in the cryo-tube. An Infested
        facsimile of a kubrow stirred, the outline familiar but the details
        distinctly Infested as it stretched its legs and emitted a sound that
        sounded pleading and worried. A tentacle reached up from the beast&#39;s
        front leg and worried at the controls holding the cryopod sealed,
        ineffectual despite the ichor marring the control pad and the matching
        raw spots on the beast&#39;s tentacle.<br /><br />The signal-source
        paused, drawing back its long reach and curling up into the warmth of
        the odd not-Infested presence. But bone-aching cold still clung to its
        being, a sensation of frost-bite at the edge of its mind.~</span

        around to grip the Marelok holstered at his lower back for some measure
        of reassurance.<br /><br />There was a clear skittishness in the
        Strider&#39;s motions as he carefully stalked deeper, closer to the
