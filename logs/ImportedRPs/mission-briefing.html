            usual the Tenno seems to have responded first to Mataeru&rsquo;s call, almost like he was just waiting for
            the message. He walks into the conference room with confidence in his step, and a battle-ready look on his
            face. In addition to his usual Orokin warrior armor apparel there seems to be a beautiful and well taken
            care of Eisen sword on his right hip. The dark steel blade shimmering in the light as he passes on the
            different lights, looking like it just has been polished. The hilt gently reflecting the floor and walls in
            its almost rose gold hue, and the grip neatly covered in dark, navy blue leather.</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Without a word being said, Vuko sits on
            the right-most, front row chair, letting the blade hang from the side. There was no need for speech, as all
            could be read from his body language &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s do this boss. I&rsquo;m ready.&rsquo;</span><span
            class="c0"><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">After waiting a few seconds, and realizing that
            no one will come as fast as him, he leans back in his chair and begins tapping the pummel of the sword in
            anticipation. &lsquo;clang&lsquo; His metal glove hitting the metal &lsquo;cling&rsquo; in a rhythmic tone.

            minutes after the message had been sent out. She quietly entered the room, remaining near the door for a
            second, her yellow eyes darting about, taking in the surroundings. She was as expressionless as usual, her
            face a stone slab that gave no hints as to what was going on within her head.<br><br>She walked in further
            now, stretching her right hand, then forming a fist, then stretching it again, she sat down in the left-most
            chair of the middle row, rolling her shoulder as she did so. She took a deep breath, then released it. The
            movements of her left arm stopped as she moved her hands onto her lap and sat looking straight ahead.</span>

            while after Isa&rsquo;s entrance, the door to the room hisses once more to reveal another familiar face.
            There is Devros, the beefy messy haired, glasses wearing boy standing by the doors with the left side of his
            head wrapped up in bandages &ndash; ear and eye alike. Other than that, he appears it spit condition with
            his Verida suit polished and cleaned and ready for action. Standing next to him is his behemoth of a
            companion and he seems to be holding something edible in his left hand.<br><br>Devros will smile at anyone
            that looks towards him and walks in, his boots landing with heavy thumps on the floor as if a mountain was
            on the march. The boy lifts his left hand and takes a juicy bite off what looks like to be a pickled condor
            chick as if it were a apple, his teeth sinking hard in to the newborns belly with a loud squishy munch,
            tearing it open like a savage beast.<br><br>Mouth full, he plops down to the chair next to Vuko, Garhul
            occupying the space between the two Tenno. Devros glances towards the Ivara user, with his one currently
            working eye, and nods at him with a grin, the flesh still swirling inside his maw and slightly poking out
            from between his teeth.</span><span class="c0"><br><br>&ldquo;Gran&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br><br></span><span
            class="c2 c0">He manages to slur out inbetween chews before gulping down and taking another bite, this time
            tearing off the chicks left wing and lowering his sullied hand to dangle off the armrest as he munches.
            <br><br>Garhul sits with ease but hoists his head to look towards Vuko, glancing at the boy with a curious
            look in his dull golden eyes.</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">(edited)</span></p>

            the carrot on the end of a stick, Kapak barged into the room with a loud slam and screech as he forced the
            doors open right as they were closing behind Devros.<br>The twisted corpse of a Warframe slithered across
            the floor like a drunken serpent, almost seeming like he was made of liquid as he appeared to melt over and
            onto the nearest chair.<br>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sup Boss man. Vuko. Devros. Weird Lady.&rdquo; He nodded to the

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c8">Disruptis:</span><span class="c0"><br></span><span class="c2 c0">Following
            silently behind the Nidus&rsquo;s rampant outburst, a black and yellow Limbo slowly entered the chamber. The
            gammacor at his hip pulsed with an intense, orange light. All sorts of lines and small orokin runes rapidly
            spun in the air along the glow&rsquo;s surface, accompanied by a quiet, low-pitched humming. Upon noticing
            the chairs, Disruptis froze mid-step. After a second or two, He quickly scurried up to one and placed a hand
            on its back. The Tenno pushed down on it, applying gentle pressure, but found it immovable. Without a word,
            Disruptis paced back into the hallway, the door closing behind him.<br><br>A minute later, he re-entered the
            room carrying a light-weight chair. The chair featured a long headrest and tucked-in footrest. Still without
            a sound, the Limbo set down the chair to the left side of the seating arrangement at the very front. His
            hands slid to the side of his recliner and pressed a button, causing the foot-rest to swing outwards and
            allowing the Tenno to lay back in his seat. He promptly did so, picking up an unidentifiable drink which
            slid out of the arms of the chair.</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">(edited)</span></p>

            Disruptis returned, a brightly coloured blue and white Octavia entered. His steps followed a set rhythm in
            time to the music playing inside his ear. Approaching the back row of chairs, he took the center most chair
            and moved over to where Disruptis was reclining. He plopped it down beside his old friend and stood, leaning
            against the back of it.</span></p>

            smiles appreciatively for the Tenno&#39;s punctuality and moves to take his place in front of the holo
            table, crossing his arms and waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. Upon Isa&#39;s entrance he raises
            an eyebrow and grins</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;Studious as ever I see.&quot;<br><br></span><span
            class="c2 c0">He then turns to Devros and his eyes widen slightly in a complicated mixture of horror,

            class="c2 c0">Looking to Kapak he nods in return to the infested monstrosity&#39;s greeting.<br>As Disruptis
            enters, leaves and re-enters, Mata&#39;s look sours at the additional chair, and his sour look turns to one
            of sheer disgust at the nonchalant behavior</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;Disruptis... This is a mission
            briefing, not a movie and dinner lounge. I expect that chair to be raised to an upright position with the
            footrest locked away and the drink to be finished before the briefing starts. Otherwise, you will be
            required to leave and view a recording of the briefing.&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2 c0">Looking to
            Cev, he nods in greeting</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;I trust the music will be at a minimum turned down

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">He waits several more minutes for more Tenno to arrive and frowns in frustration
            as no one else appears before he dims the lights in the room and brings the holoprojector to full power,
            casting a bluish hue on the Tenno seated before him.</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;Good morning Tenno and
            thank you for time. As you all know, our immediate goal is to capture Earth and purge the Grineer and
            Infested from the planets surface. However, in order to do that, we will need some additional firepower, and
            a safe base of operations. Ideally, an Orokin Tower would serve that purpose best, but until now, there has
            been no way to take one over.&quot;<br></span><span class="c2 c0">The hologram zooms in on a Corpus compound

            connects to a tower that has not been completely overrun by the Corrupted and Neural sentries. On the other
            hand, he has managed to secure funding from several Corpus houses and and has received military support.
            While this is good and bad news for us, I have been unable to locate him or the ship he will be using to
            travel to the dig site.&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2 c0">he pauses for a moment as the hologram
            highlights several key locations in the installation</span><span class="c4 c0 c5"><br>&quot;This
            installation is maximum security and houses the data vaults we will need to access in order to find Drau.
            Vuko and I will be among the members of the Remnant assigned to an infiltration team to extract the data. If
            anyone else is capable of extracting data without be detected please let me know and I will also assign you
            to the group.&quot;<br></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The hologram then changes to a supply depot in a different location on
            Pluto</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;The second team will escort Isa to this supply depot and assist her
            in hijacking a Corpus shuttle. Cause as much of a distraction as you can to give her time to get aboard,
            hack the systems if need be, and get it out. Once she is clear, we will all rendezvous at an abandoned
            Corpus dig site south of the depot and pack our Warframes into several supply crates that Isa will smuggle
            aboard Drau&#39;s ship. Anyone who wishes to be a part of the assault team needs to let me know. Anyone else
            will simply be stationed at the dig site.&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2 c0">The hologram changes
            images once more to show a Corpus freighter</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;It is unknown if Drau will be
            travelling with a military escort or not. I suspect he will not so as not to draw attention to the Grineer,
            but we will not know until we are aboard. If there is a military escort, we will need to ultimately destroy
            or disable them as well.&quot;<br></span><span class="c2 c0">He pauses for a moment as he changes
            topics</span><span class="c4 c0 c5"><br><br>&quot;Once we are aboard Drau&#39;s ship, we will need to
            disable it. Our infiltration squad will handle that as a full blown assault on the reactor would give Drau
            the chance to escape. Once the reactor has been sabotaged, we then have two options. Our infiltration team
            can quietly make a move on Drau and capture him while the crew figures out what is going on, then meet up
            with the assault squadron to purge the crew. Alternatively, the assault squadron and infiltration teams can
            join forces and eliminate the crew, then go after Drau together. Let me know what your preferred path is. If
            there is a military escort, the Assault team will be redeployed into Archwings to destroy or disable the
            accompanying ships before they are able to reinforce the Corpus aboard Drau&#39;s vessel. Depending on the
            situation, it may be possible to get Isa on board one of the ships and commandeer it, but that will have to
            be a judgement call in the moment.&quot; </span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The hologram changes to that of an Orokin tower next</span><span
            class="c4 c0 c5"><br>&quot;When we reach the dig site, we will need to kill everyone. The Assault team will
            take care of that while the infiltration team secures a landing site for a single landing craft carrying
            supplies. Before we set off for Pluto, we will need to stock the landing craft with alternate Warframes,
            weapons, and additional supplies, as well as several of our shipboard Cephalons. In the event the tower
            Cephalon is unresponsive, we will need the assistance of our Cephalons to either erase, or reprogram the
            tower&#39;s. Make sure the items you store in the landing craft are appropriate for a long and drawn out
            seige. While there will not be as many corrupted as a regular tower, there will still be aheft number and we
            will need to deal with them. There is also no tell how long we will be stranded aboard the tower. The void
            gate will take some time to repair, and overriding the current cephalon will take hours, if not days&#39;
            worth of work.&quot;<br></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c8">Muro:</span><span class="c0"><br>~As Mata finished his briefing, the sound of
            heavy footsteps could be heard moving fast towards the command room. &nbsp;As the doors slid open, a rather
            large Hydroid sprinted into the room, not even trying to be subtle about his entrance.~<br><br></span><span
            class="c4 c2 c0">Muro weighed his options as he charged into the room, swearing at himself with every step.
            Under ordinary circumstances, he would never have been late for a meeting like this, but what started as a
            simple errand for his Cephalon turned into a brawl with a patrolling Grineer squad that took far longer than
            it had any right to. The way he saw it, he had two options now: either he could apologize profusely as he
            ran, possible disrupting the meeting more than he already has, or just stay silent and just take whatever
            punishment Mata would have lined up for him later. Deciding on the latter, he practically slid into the
            leftmost chair in the front row, bringing his Fragor out from its holster at the base of his spine so he
            could be seated. As he settled into his chair, he brought the hammer down &nbsp;head first as gently as he
            could, resting it between his legs. &nbsp;Muro looked up towards Mata, feeling his leader&#39;s icy gaze
            upon him. he searched for words to explain himself, but nothing satisfactory came up. &nbsp;All he could do
            was hang his head after a moment of what would have passed for eye contact between two Warframes. Whatever
            the mission was, he would have to find out for himself later.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c8">Disruptis:</span><span class="c0"><br></span><span class="c2 c0">Disruptis froze
            in place. He swirled the liquid around in its glass slowly, trying not sulk in the feeling of betrayal at
            Mataeru&rsquo;s reprimand. A reddish-brown smoldered within the contents of his drink, although calling it a
            &lsquo;drink&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t correct. It was an experimental solution he had whipped up in order to
            counteract the abnormal effects of a creature he owned. The effects currently riddled the Tenno&rsquo;s
            warframe, slowly breaking down its sword-steel casing into composite metallic powder. He had already tracked
            an unnoticeable thin layer of dust into the room.<br><br>According to what Kapak had told him, whom
            Disruptis had consulted much on the matter, a little bit of it was enough to begin a chain of reactions
            leading to the nullification of the mysterious properties. The knowledge little beyond the befuddled Limbo,
            but tests had proved its success. Additionally, in order to help spreading, it was best to remain lying at
            an angle closest to 180 degrees as possible. Disruptis didn&rsquo;t want to be late for the meeting, so he
            thought he&rsquo;d just apply it and still be able to listen and partake in conversation. He clenched his
            hands and lowered his head. Looks like that may have not been the best decision after all.<br><br>Mataeru
            had always been one to jump to conclusions. This time was no exception. A worry formed in the Tenno&rsquo;s
            head. The worry that sometime, someplace, he would do something the squad leader would gravely
            misunderstand, and pitch the two Naramon against each other. He shoved the thought to the back of his mind,
            then with precise dexterity, poured a line of the dark liquid over his torso.</span><span
            class="c4 c0 c5"><br><br>&ldquo;Sorry Mataeru, I just need to be leaning back so I can perform some urgent
            patch-up on my &lsquo;frame while you debrief us. I didn&rsquo;t want to miss this though.&rdquo;</span></p>

            wearing boy follows the projections with his one currently working eye, ever so often taking huge juicy
            chunks off the pickled condor chick, even the bones. He tries to chew as quietly as possible but the
            occasional crunch rings out which makes him pause his eating to glance at the people around him before
            continuing the feast. Breakfast is a important meal, and Devros isn&rsquo;t one to skip any kind of food so
            next best thing is bringing the munchies along to the meeting.<br><br>He listens intently and studies the
            images closely, squinting once in a while to get a better look of the projections. Damn, this is a full
            blown out operation right here. Devros has never been a part of such a organized unit, not to mention this
            whole thing is held together by invisible strings&hellip;there is a lot of ways this can go bad.<br><br>But,
            he smiles, finding it exciting.<br><br>Gulping down the last pieces of the chick, he lowers his hand to
            dangle off the side, to which Garhul reacts, and starts licking it clean from the oozes and blood that
            stained it.</span><span class="c0"><br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wi&#39; any assault &#39;eadin&#39; on

            compliment is met with three seconds of cold, unfeeling staring followed by an ever so slight nod. The
            comments about the others were met with a flash of annoyance in the Tenno&#39;s yellow eyes. She didn&#39;t
            care what the others did during this meeting, so long as they absorbed the information given. The Tenno
            appeared to relax somewhat, crossing her arms now and leaning back in her chair as Mataeru&#39;s lecture
            began. She tilted her head somewhat to the left as she listened to the portion on hijacking a shuttle. She
            quietly waited, listening until the end and waiting for other questions to be answered before asking her
            own.</span><span class="c4 c0 c5"><br><br>&quot;For this shuttle hijacking, will I be infiltrating the
            Corpus ranks, or simply joining the assault team using a Warframe? I feel it may be easier to infiltrate and
            get several crewmen to attempt to evacuate with me. Taking them by surprise with void powers on the shuttle
            should allow me to kill them easily, transferring into my Warframe if absolutely necessary. The shuttle will
            not need to be hacked and there will be little need to protect me.&quot;</span></p>

            with his own chair. Other than that he stays quiet, nodding along to Mataeru&rsquo;s presentation, as all is

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c8">Muro: </span><span class="c0"><br></span><span class="c2 c0">Muro weighed his
            options carefully. He knew a bit about the plan from their last big meeting, enough to know that either side
            could use a medic, should things go south. Additionally, he had no intention of being sidelined for this
            mission, so standby was out of the question. He took a quick look around, seeing who else was present.
            Seeing the present crowd, he answered Mata&#39;s question with one of his own.</span><span
            class="c0"><br><br>&quot;I guess it depends boss. Who&#39;s going where?&quot; </span><span class="c2 c0">He
            briefly looked over his shoulder at Kapak, who seemed to be eyeing something very closely indeed at the
            moment.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Since Kapak and I are the only ones here with any healing
            abilities to work with, I should probably go with whichever squad he isn&#39;t part of. That way, both teams
            have a way to keep themselves alive if something goes wrong.&quot; </span><span class="c4 c2 c0">Muro had a
            hunch which squad Kapak would join, given what he had seen of the monstrous Nidus so far, which likely meant
            he would be on the infiltration team. Not his first choice, but he&#39;d go where he was needed
