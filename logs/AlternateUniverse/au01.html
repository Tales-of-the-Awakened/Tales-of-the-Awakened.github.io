drooling on.~<br><br><u>Kapak:</u><br>‚ÄúOh my,‚Äù the Warframe growled 
through a surprisingly functional mouth, ‚Äúthis stuff smells too good. 
Don‚Äôt eat don‚Äôt eat don‚Äôt eat...‚Äù<br>The Warframe spoke to itself as it laid the tray onto a table in the center of the room.<br>‚ÄúAh.
 There we go. Now I just need some people to show up to prevent me from 
eating all of this deliciousness... I guess people should be arriving 
soon!‚Äù<br>Kapak looked at a clock mounted on the wall.<br>‚ÄúI hope Leks gets here soon with all that tea! Can‚Äôt have snacks without a drink, I tell you.‚Äù

                            /Lekalis/<br><br>Rampant possibilities ran 
ripe through the Strider's mind as he patiently waited at the bottom of 
the Elevator; it seemed these devices took forever to come down and go 
up, and were always too crowded... even when he was alone.<br>Just as 
the fibres of his patience were about to snap and he reasoned a vent 
looked breakable enough, a dull thrum announced the arrival of the 
Elevator back at the base of its channel. Lekalis didn't hesitate as his
 battered Loki Prime slipped into the tube and easily flicked a toe up 
to poke at the console, beginning the delivery of himself up to the 
predescribed locale for tea.<br><br>Tea, of which, was held heavily in 
his arms; laden with a familiar and simple iron dish whose corners were 
chipped and jagged, and its surface more than a bit warbled... But it 
was <i>familiar</i>. He knew its grooves and awkward slants, so that the
 variety of tea still steaming in equally iron cups, all stayed still 
but for the slightest of wobbles in movement that only served to stir 
and brew the substance further.<br>Unlike most of Lekalis' proceedings, 
this setup was a bit more extavagent; Ruk's Klaw, Lunar Pitchers, and 
all measures of ingredients were arrayed throughout in a wreath along 
the dish. Small red berries were laced throughout like so many little 
lights. The oils of the berries glistened in the lights that passed over
 the Strider and his array of tea as he ascended within the Elevator 
shaft.<br>[1/2]

                            [2/2]<br><br>For once, the ascent was short 
and joyous; Lekalis' heart was unburdened by any woes, rather, he was 
all afloat in all measures but the physical as his half-horn helm wilted
 to one side in surprised delight at the '<i>DING!</i>' of the Elevator's arrival.<br><br>The
 doors opened, and Lekalis stepped through with his tray full of tea, 
and spied the table just as the metal dias began to wobble precariously;
 there was a flicker of orange light as a Decoy apparated beside a 
Nidus, and another whirl of sunny twinkling as the Strider Switched with
 the Decoy to drop the tray rather gracefully but... loudly, beside 
Kapak. <br><br>Who, with much glee and perhaps some exasperation, Lekalis finally acknowledged with a spriteful pirhouette of a bow.<br>"Apologies : The rain delayed me."

 that stressed Leveret the most in preparation for this event. He wasn't
 used to potluck-style gatherings, and the canned fish and stolen 
rations his defector friends made do with at their dojo-turned-base 
seemed inappropriate.<br><br>He'd settled on bringing a variety of Cetus
 fish, salted and spiced and roasted on sticks to create an enticing 
aroma unmatched by anything he'd normally encounter.<br><br>The elevator ride was itself exciting, full of the smells of all the other foods already carried upwards inside it.<br>[1/2]

 hello!" he said loudly, excitedly spying a table full of goodies and 
some of his Tenno friends already waiting! Placing the fish-stacked 
black metal pan on the table, he first moved to Lekalis to give the 
battered Loki one of the standard Steel Meridian handshakes, which 
quickly ended with a powerful hug, another of which he bestowed upon 
Kapak soon after.<br><br>"Looks like not everyone is here yet," he commented, "hopefully folks will arrive soon!"

                            Rize <br>"Woah woah careful, just a little 
further." Rize told herself as she was bringing in a small tower of meat
 from earth, mars, and other places which were wobbling ever so slightly
 which made her nervous wanting to make the best first impression she 
could.  Waiting for the elevator to come down she wondered who she would
 be meeting.  <i>DING</i> "Finally, elevators always take forever. <i>SIGH</i>
 Oh well time to get up there before something bad happens." Rize said 
as she got into the elevator carefully then hit the top button with her 
foot which almost made her fall over with the tower of meat for this 
party.  And then the elevator reached the top floor far faster than it 
did coming down for some crazy reason.  Rize then exited the elevator 
only for her to start falling over.  "WoahwoahwoahwoahWOAH.  LOOK OUT!!"
 Rize shouted as she began to toss the containers with the food onto the
 table with skill you normally would expect of a tenno using a warframe 
rather than a red veil member.  "Woo, that was rather close. <i>heh</i> 
Nice to meet you all i'm Rize.  Forgive the introduction i really wanted
 to make a better one but i was starting to lose my grip on the meat i 
brought." Rize said slightly cheerful but mostly out of breath while 
falling back somewhat exhausted.

                            <u>Kapak:</u><br>"Ah, excellent!" Kapak 
cracked a smile across his cherry-like head as the faint aroma of the 
tea escaped from the vessel Leks had set upon the table. The thud had 
indeed startled him, but just a tad.<br>Kapak watched, leaning against 
the table as Leveret approached the group, giving the familiar Frost a 
grin and a solid nod. Once the Nidus received the embrace of Leveret, he
 couldn't help but stiffen up awkwardly.<br>"Uhhh... thanks Lev..." Kapak choked on his words, "good to see you too."<br>The
 Nidus' breathlessness was not a result of Leveret's tight squeeze, but 
rather his awkwardness when it came to physical acts of affection that 
were greater than a hearty handshake.<br>As Rize entered the room with 
his meat, Kapak couldn't help but drip nearly a whole bucket of saliva 
from his jaw onto his own feet.<br>"Ah, yes, Rize, very nice to eat- I mean, meat... er, meet you!"

 elevator ride wasn't as adventurous, but as the doors opened, her

                            <b>KAMOS &amp; ATELA</b><br>Well, just 
Kamos. At first glance. He exited the elevator himself a bit after 
Sudoko, because he had to, y'know, wait for it to come pick him up. Why 
was this elevator so slow, and why were people going in one at a time? 
Whatever. The Rhino surveyed the room as he walked/stomped in, taking 
notice of Lev and Leks almost immediately. And y'know, there were 
others, but those two in particular. He stepped aside from the elevator 
and stood there, sort of surveying the room for a moment. If anyone was 
paying very close attention to the table, they might maybe possibly see a
 salad that wasn't there moments ago. Made of all sorts of various Earth
 plants, it didn't look too bad. Still just a salad, though.<br><br>The 
reason for its sudden appearance would become clear, when someone else 
entered. Well, 'entered' wasn't the right word. Atela had, in fact, 
gotten here long before Kapak, through the power of vents and 
invisibility. She placed the salad whilst invisible, and moved back to 
the corner she had been waiting in this whole time, before uncloaking. 
And just like that, the duo was here. Kamos wandered over to where Atela
 stood a moment later, and the two nodded to each other and stood there 
in silence. Looks like people were arriving, finally.

 name‚Äôs Kapak,‚Äù the Nidus said, picking a piece of meat off the pile on 
the table and depositing it into his Warframe‚Äôs skeletal jaw.<br>Kapak 
took a moment to look around the room, taking advantage of his Nidus‚Äô 
absurd height. He scoured the heads of everyone to see who had shown up 
and who hadn‚Äôt yet.<br>Leveret, Lekalis, Ella, Kamos, Vuko, Atela and 
the two newcomers. Strangely, Disruptis still hadn‚Äôt shown up, but that 
was no surprise. That void-headed dope was always either fashionably 
late or stupidly late. Cev might‚Äôve been with him, or maybe he was out 
doing something somewhere else in the System. And of course, Isa... 
parties were definitely not the Corpus Tenno‚Äôs scene, but Kapak has 
figured she‚Äôd at least come to deliver some of her Nutrition Bricks.<br>Still no sign of Muro, who he figured would‚Äôve come with Vuko.<br>Kapak
 shrugged to himself and grabbed a handful of meat, throwing it into his
 maw and sealing the lump whole. The others Would come, eventually, 
perhaps. And who knows who other newcomers may appear?

begin to look around the area.. seeing many different Tenno. <br><br>‚ÄúMother scrap... that‚Äôs a lot of people. Bugger. What should I do?...

 in a slightly bemused tone, pointing a single gold gilded fingertip of 
his Ramses Inaros over at Jay'kins position from across the room.<br><br>Lupin
 had arrived shortly after the other Tenno and had walked out the 
ever-too-slow elevator just in time to catch a door slide open to let in
 the less coorditated Tenno. He then survey the room and spotted some 
well known guises, which confirmed the locale was indeed correct.<br><br>He
 stepped off the elevator to allow it retreat back down, clutching onto 
the wrapped box with his good arm, worrying the contents be disturbed in
 the slightest. His free arm found a comftable spot behind his back as 
he waited to be greeted and introduced into the party.

of all the conversation, the elevator had returned to the ground floor, 
allowing the next pair of attendees, a Tenno and a green MOA, to enter 
and begin their ascent. As the elevator sped upwards, the Tenno shifted 
his weight, his arms burdened with what looked like an explosion of 
plant life.<br><br><b>Muro:</b><br>"Are you sure they're going to like these?" He asked the MOA, his face obscured by the many blooms he was carrying.<br><br><b>Aurelia:</b><br>"Of
 course they'll love them, will you stop worrying?" The MOA responded 
incredulously.  "Anyone would think to bring food, but no one would 
think to bring something like this!" Though it wasn't visible through 
the Warframe's helmet, Muro rolled his eyes good-naturedly.<br><br><b>Muro:</b><br>"You
 can say that again." He murmured, before shifting his grip again.  The 
MOA snapped its optic sensors upwards towards the Tenno. <br><br><b>Aurelia:</b><br>"I
 heard that." She huffed.  "And please Muro, for void's sake be careful 
with those. If a single one of those arrangements are out of place I 
will hold you personally accountable." Muro almost couldn't hold back a 
chuckle at her threat.<br><br><b>Muro:</b><br>"Yeah, yeah." Just then 
the elevator jerked to a stop, signaling that they had arrived at their 
floor. As the doors opened, the the veritable cascade of floral scents 
that the elevator had been containing spilled into the main room.  Muro 
decided to take initiative and step out into the room, though he 
couldn't really see in front of him.  "Hey everybody! Sorry we're late."
 Aurelia entered behind Muro, flanking him on his left. (1/2)

red ribbon that had been tied around what passed as the MOA‚Äôs neck.  
Looking around for a brief moment, Aurelia spotted a fairly empty table.
 ‚ÄúMuro, there‚Äôs a table approximately four meters in front of you. Be a 
dear and <i>carefully</i> set those arrangements down there. Muro 
grunted affirmatively and slowly strode in the indicated direction, 
carefully testing his steps to ensure he didn‚Äôt trip over anything. 
While he was occupied, Aurelia noted a few familiar faces and strode 
towards them. <br>‚ÄúGood evening Vuko, and you as well Kapak. Glad to see we aren‚Äôt the only ones who are late.‚Äù<br>(2/2)

 a couple scientists pushing a cart of hazardous vials as he continued

 the Limbo caught a look at the wall around the corner, and did a double
 take. There, on the regular ferrite and alloy, was a glowing yellow 
crack. <br><br>The crack seemed to extend infinitely into the wall which
 constantly churned like an event horizon on an orange and red hue. It 
was by far the weirdest thing Disruptis had ever seen. He swiftly placed
 his baggage on the floor and ran a hand over extraterrestrial 
apparition, only to find it cleanly enter the hole. Curious.

the eerie halls once again. His focus was glued to the special synoid 
gammacor mounted onto his hand. It was feeding him information about the
 recently scanned abnormality he had left to security.<br><br><i>15,502,600,000 cubic meters? Muck, that‚Äôs the max limit on this thing. It‚Äôs probably even bigger!</i> <br><br>He
 mulled over these thoughts as he called an elevator. Today was an open 
house. That meant inviting a bunch of Tenno interested in the /RU 
corporation, and possibly people who were just interested in having a 
peaceful moment for once. First impressions were key.<br><br>Disruptis 
straightened the white tie hanging around his Limbo‚Äôs collar. He would 
have to worry about the whole rift-inside-the-wall thing later, now was 
time to enjoy the company.

each other. About what was unknown, as they were likely talking too 
quietly for anyone to hear, but they spoke. There was the occasional 
glance toward the salad from Atela, but that was about it.  Generally, 
it would seem the two were currently staying out of this party right

just as well have been a scoff,  at his own bug joke. "Pleased to make 
your acquaintance, Leveret. And worry not, there's a plethora of guises 
picking my interest; I simply prefer to take my time digesting the 
encounters." He said with a coy smile behind the 'mask', he wasn't one 
for comedy, but mixing social gatherings and wordplay were one of the 
few small treats left unfazed by the passage of time.<br><br>"I would be
 delighted to have you join me for a game of Komi afterwards, if that 
would interest you, Leveret." He added, as he turned back to the table 
to slide the box' lid completely off. "And please, use the spare sets 
freely." He offered at last, as he pulled one of four Komi boards 
crafted in full Orokin fashion; the grey marble inlaid with gold 
filigrees matched the black and white pieces, each with a meticulously 
engraved sun or moon on their surface, matching their respective colors.
 The board pulsed with faint cyan energy as the magnetic surface sprung 
to life, demanding it be played.<br><br>"The first move will be yours, Jay'lin." He pointed out while handing them the small compartment filled with the black pieces.

draws back in shock, then sidesteps with all the silent, lithe grace of 
her kind. Knowingly or not, she finds herself flitting across to the 
foodstuffs. Pausing there, she examines her surroundings a second time, 
one silver-gold hand raising to fiddle with an ornament of her helm's 
circlet, but stopping short, she resumes her hand to her side and shifts
 from one foot to the other.<br><br>At last, however, she lowers herself
 to both knees and rests her hands in her lap, the Warframe assuming a 
strange calm befitting of the regal, scarlet cloak that half-curls about
 her side. Noticeable now is a large greatsword slung between her 
shoulders, the edge keen and cutting a thin groove in the floor before 
its owner settles.*

eternity of stumbling blindly forward, Muro felt the thud of a table 
against his leg. Sighing in relief, he began to set the collection of 
flowers on the table. He still didn't understand why Aurelia had to go 
and prepare so many of these arrangements, but at the very least he was 
happy to be done carrying them. Hearing footsteps approaching him, Muro 
turned around to see Vuko striding towards him, arm outstretched. <br><br>"Vuko!"
 he said loudly, joyously walking towards him. Muro returned his 
handshake tightly before pulling him in for a brief bro hug. "Sorry 
we're so late, Aurelia wouldn't let us dock until she had finished her 
gifts." Pulling back a moment,  Muro looked over Vuko's shoulder towards
 the rest of the room, noting the unfamiliar faces mixed in with his 
friends. "Hey, who're the new people?"

 and flickered over the various Warframes.<br>It had been so long since 
he'd seen such rapturous splendor amidst those faces he might call

muttered some distant hello's and goodbye's until he found a seat, upon 
the floor neath the window Vuko had invaded through; The Strider's hands
 fidgeted over his sash and produced a familiar iron cannister that 
shook in his prosthetic hand, while his good hand procured a triad of 
iron cups which he set afloat beside his lazily sat form.<br>In some 
measure of recollection, he methodically saw to pouring out a hot, 
bubbling and clear liquid into each iron cup as his eye watched the

table and board, making his way over to the the outside-facing wall; he 
gave the mysterious figure an acknowledging nod before knelting a 
comfortable distance away, certain not to disturb them, proceeding then 
to take on a more comfortable meditative position. Wisps of deep purple 
energy briefly spewed from the warframe's back as the elegant frame of a
 young man emerged materialized.<br><br>The black-haired tenno took a 
moment to straighten out his long flowing suit and properly affix the 
shoulderpad. Taking one more moment to check his reflection on the 
nearby window, he found himself pleased with the highlight upon his 
svelte figure and sharp facial features; he held his hands behind his 
back, and returned to the party with a stern and heavy, yet graceful 
step. [ <a href="https://imgur.com/a/gXFStbA">https://imgur.com/a/gXFStbA</a> ]

 one overflowed, and each had a equalized rise of fluid; a soft sizzle 
brimmed and frothed at the lip of each hovering cup as the Strider's vox
 sparked up in its signature and staticky filter.<br>"Hello Leveret."<br>Lekalis
 agreeably accomodated the Frost's sittings with a bow of the brow. The 
red braid on his one good horn bobbed and danced in the motion.<br><br>"Would you like : tea, chatter... silence?" He inquired humbly as his eye finally broke its attentions to look at Leveret,<br>"It
 has been awhile : unfortunately, sadly... You look happier out of the 
rain." The Strider's hands moved as if posed about by some puppetteer, 
each finger twitching and wrist moving as if tugged along by a string. 
Graceful still, in a curious, mechanical way as he produced a lock of 
Ruk's Klaw roots and a root like ginger in his hands. He held them 
ready, as he waited for Leveret's answer.

stricken for a moment, as Leveret removed his self from the Warframe; 
Lekalis supposed it did seem like what most were making out to do... it 
made sense.<br>"You know... I never knew : Why, how... what. Tea I made." he admitted as he nodded once in kind to Leveret's declaration.<br><br>The
 Ruk's Klaw roots were already so fine, and the power behind the Loki 
Prime's digits so great, that the substance was ground to a powder with a
 snap of his fingers. The pale substance trickled out and covered the 
liquid, ceasing its frothing nature with a veil of bone-like powder. The
 next were shavings of the ginger root, which the Strider idly clove 
free with the nail of his good hand as he spoke on,<br>"I made tea for 
myself : alone, dark, silent... For the longest time. Between 
deployments, between bloodsheds." The Strider shrugged and the root has 
been finely sheared off into the cup, gone in his hands. Now, he dipped 
the slightly ashen hued little finger of his good hand into the brew; 
the finger was far from little, rather grotesquely long like a spine on a
 fish... but it slid through the powdery veil and began to stir.<br><br>"I
 used to be so... Good. With crowds : communes, forums, festivals..." 
The Strider hummed, sadly, and pulled out his little finger and examined
 the slightly viscous substance with some scrutiny.<br>"... But... those
 times are like... dreams. Now. Distant but waiting : on the horizon, 
behind the closed eye, the dead mind." The Strider's hand stiffened, and
 looked to Kinsey now with some bemusement, before shuddering like a cat
 spritz'd with water. <br>[1/2]

 Behind the synthesized drag of his vox, it was hard to tell whether it 
was a long melancholy or long desired exaltation as he let his Loki 
Prime's limbs rest out in its lap, as the familiar phantom white limbs 
of Lekalis' Operator flickered out amidst a mist. More flush, with rosy 
hues on the joints: knuckles, wrist, digits... The harsh jagged cuts of 
chitin and plugs for unknown fluids weren't gone, but galvanized in scar
 tissues.<br>The Strider's fair wrists were loosely bound in jade, each 
holding a strong red ribbon, the size of his lithe arms themselves, 
flowing back to his elbow where another jade band rested easily about 
the slim elbow.<br><br>His fingers moved with an almost hypnotizing 
flair, there were trinkets and baubles of bronze and jade and ruby 
again, set about his long willowy fingers whose porcelain nails clinked 
quietly upon the iron cup, cradling it within a cage of pale flesh and 
jade binds.<br>"I will forget : this tea, these faces... These... warm. 
Times." there was a soft fizz and crackle of radiation that microwaved 
the tea to warmth again.<br><br>The arms extended out, holding the 
teacup  in both hands, out to Kinsey. The limbs looked weak, but 
stronger than the skeletons they'd appeared in the past.<br>The hands still shook with some small strength that struggled to hold the cup aloft.<br>"So will you. Like tears : in rain. It frightens me."

materialized, they fought off both the feeling of being woefully

 as some began to shed their frames to witness their dreaming selves. 
For a long moment, there was a pause in the Banshee's actions, as if 
itself was to judge whether to shed its precious controller. Standing 
against a wall, a small, lithe form would shakily waltz from her frame, a
 hood drawn over her hidden face, clothe of orokin origin would sway in 
her stead, feathers swaying of regal breeds, the longest of her 
shoulder, and of one peeking out of her hood, of an earthly aurora.<br><br>She
 would approach the table of mouthwatering goods, her stomach growling

                            /Lekalis/<br><br>"Yes... You are : Here, 
present, aware. Around. Of sorts." The Strider nebulously agreed to the 
assurances of Leveret as the arms withdrew and delicately moved another 
of the iron cups to float before him. The nails, as refined as they were
 and as fragile as the limbs of the Strider appeared, looked impeccably 
proud and strong; a subtle pattern like scales had been engraved upon 
the surface using what looked like old dust, that caught the lights ever
 so slightly and shimmered with some distant Orokin radiance.<br><br>Suddenly, the Strider gently exclaimed with some surprise,<br>"Ah...
 I'd almost forgot!" His hands moved with haste, but still retained a 
characteristic grace to the way his arms flowed and peeled away at the 
sash bound about his Loki Prime's chest, and held a cup of small 
seedlings in his palm. Their shells were hard, but green, and looked 
almost like Old Earth Sunflower Seeds, though some might know their 
tougher exterior and greenish hue to be the adolescent seeds of Ruk's 
Klaw.<br>Even as Kinsey drank from the tea, Lekalis' hands moved and 
popped the shell of each seed to drop the sharp smelling seeds into the 
brew; most dissolved, though some still fell to the bottom of the cup to
 be had later.<br><br>The sudden blanket over the flavor was very 
apparent; the spice and kick of the ginger and Ruk's Klaw was reined 
back by those dissolved seeds, covering the otherwise spicy tang with 
something pleasantly sweet. Like honey and barley. It was a homely 
flavor, though the undertone of kick tasted almost like a pleasant twist
 on some Grineer Grokdrul brew.<br>[1/2]

                            [2/2]<br><br>The Strider's form was still, 
as the phantasmal limbs rose and flowed from one space to another like a
 blade of grass in a stream; though his arms never leant forward to 
leave the corpus of his Warframe.<br>"Much better. You're a good friend :
 humble, honest, here." He swiftly recalled the topic at hand as his 
mistsome arms fell back and phased into his Warframe, where there was 
hardly a stutter in the transfer of motion as power returned to the Loki
 Prime; he looked to Disruptis, then Ella in kind with a measured wave 
of his prosthetic hand, while his good hand idly rummaged about in his 
sash.<br><br>"How are you, then? I have never heard you worry about yourself."

"You make amazing tea, Leks. As always."<br><br>"Heh, well, I dunno about humble. But I take care of my friends, you know?"<br><br>Another
 sip of tea. "And yeah, I've been doing pretty good. Plenty of Steel

return to the table as to fully appreciate the party with his own 
senses, unfiltered by transference. His hands only broke free from each 
other's grasp to inspect the odd item on the table, to take in the 
texture and weight of the mouth-watering baked goods. Upon returning to 
the board, his eyes methodically scanned his opponent: an impeccable 
skin, devoid of void burn scar, a certain wild fiery defiance in their 
eyes, the well-maintained armor and neatly combed hair which spoke of 
dedication and attention to detail. <br><br>"I must say, I'm delighted 
to see you've chosen to join me in meeting eye to eye. The occasion to 
share time away from them and in the company of peers is often rare, and
 seldom pleasant." His voice was smoother in person than it had been 
through the somatic link, yet still carried a certain coarseness that 
betrayed the juvenile nature of their 'race'. Only once the contrived 
attempt at pleasantries had expired did his eyes break away from his 
opponent and return to the board.<br><br>"A relentless offensive indeed,
 how quaint." He mused with earnest amusement as the faintest of smiles 
curled the edge of his lips. "Forgive my bluntness, but are you one to 
find yourself unsure on the defensive?" He asked with curiosity as he 
placed his next piece to the top right of the center piece, threatening 
the first piece of the match. [ <a href="https://imgur.com/2zEPi9A.png">https://imgur.com/2zEPi9A.png</a> ]

 an unoccupied area of the room. He kept his head down, not wanting to

Light delicately bouncing off of the pale gold spikes, cloth moving in 
tandem with him, as if the Tenno was the wind given form. His hair was 
the color of the ocean during the fiercest of storms, shimmering between
 blue of the deepest of trenches and cyan of a warm shallow sea. And his
 eyes, if one was bold enough to look into them, were a dull amethyst, a
 stone once shining with radiance and vibrancy, but dulled by time and 
experience.<br><br>Vuko left the warframe next to the wall, and went to 
mingle with everyone with confidence in his step. But first, just as he 
said, he made his way back to the table he had set up before and poured

 yes, maybe... I do miss the Meridian, and Cressa..." He hummed quietly,
 the shifting in his sash swiftly devolved to simple idle fidgeting as 
he pulled out the iron cannister from before and set it out below the 
hovering cups, which he then tilted over so the fluids would return to 
the container.<br><br>"... Ghouls, though? Dangerous, voltaile, literally explosive." Lekalis huffed, pluffing his shoulders in a shrug,<br>"You
 are bold." He mused with a small chuckle as his movements became 
quicker and, while they had been inherently graceful before, an art 
returned to their locomotion. A direction, of sorts.<br><br>"Perhaps I 
shall come by sometime. If I remember." he poked lightly at his own 
worries as he pushed himself up and returned the iron cannister into his
 sash in a singular sweep. Cups, too, were slipped almost unnoticeably 
back into his sash.<br>"I am feeling... : Better. Thank you." The 
Half-Horn Loki bowed his broken crown with some swelling pride as he 
rose and slipped his arms lightly into where the sash crossed his 
breast.<br><br>Quietly, Lekalis motioned for Kinsey to follow him as he 
began to stalk his way across the walls of the party; his sunny eye 
switching between Kamos and Atela, and The Runner. As well as the 
enticing spurts of debauchery being carried out at the core of the room.
 There was a (dangerous) pondering yearning in his gaze, as he watched 
the drinks get downed.

shark to a school of fish.<br>"Did you know : I used to drink Grineer, 
Corpus... some Orokin, even, under the table?" He mused as his good hand
 curled up and pinched at the hem of his scarf about his neck. The 
Strider's staticky vox cleared its throat, sounded more like a speaker 
getting unplugged than anything, as if he were testing his throat.<br>"I
 remember I had to play : Stoic and sober for the Grineer. Tipsy and 
witless for the Corpus... The Orokin..." Lekalis' tone drew dire as his 
vox popped and he twisted the cylinders jutting out of his occular 
augment,<br>"... It was fun, playing the fool."<br><br>The Strider's path had him pass by Kamos and Atela with another small wave,<br>"Hello there..." He offered halfly invitingly as he continued on, watching them from his periphery to see if they might follow.

seemed to be explaining something to Kamos, which only became audible as
 Lekalis walked by. Kamos seemed to be nodding in response, noticable 
even before Lekalis was close. This conversation's probably been going 
for a while. Atela stopped talking, though, when she saw the Loki was 
here. She became silent, and merely kept an eye on Lekalis.<br><br>"Hey,
 Leks. Long time no see." Kamos responded to Lekalis, albeit almost 
uncharacteristically quietly. He would normally be speaking much, much 
louder than this. He raised his hand in a bit of a wave, again something
 unusually calm for him.

Warframe's were usually hard to read, given their statuesque forms, but 
there were tells in everything. Even still, Lekalis was making more 
assumptions off of what he wasn't seeing than anything else. Their 
steely silence wasn't too uncharacteristic from Lekalis' recollections,

looked over at Leveret for a moment, shrugging and turning back to focus
 on Lekalis. "I was expecting something a bit quieter, I suppose. Now 
everyone's drunk and yelling."<br><br>"I mean, I'm not against yelling 
and stuff, but I just dunno." Kamos followed up, after Atela was 
finished. He seemed less like his usual stoic, sort of vaguely angry 
self. He seemed a lot more calm. Lekalis and Leveret would probably both
 know he didn't act like this in combat situations. Maybe it was somehow
 related to Atela's presence. Regardless, Kamos and Atela both stayed 
where they were, surveying this party.

halfwise in reply to Leveret's bubblesome glee. It was inspiring but... 
The duo before him held his rapt intrigue as he let his helm wilt to one
 shoulder, the good horn's braid touching his good arm.<br>"... Perhaps 
we can gather we : gloomy, dramatic, fools. Together, find a suitably : 
gloomy, dramatic, foolish locale to mull about in?" The Strider's tenor 
 was unburdened by static, and now seemed stimulated by the appeal of 
yet more comrades in arms. <br><br>The Strider's good hand expertly 
flourished into and out of his sash to produce the two cups he'd emptied
 just before, flashing them out with such speed as to make it seem nigh 
like an illusion. Yet an after image of the iron seemed to linger, even 
after the invitation was proposed.<br>"I'd a mind to join the 
drinking... But I imagine Kapak might spoil the competition." Lekalis 
teased the Infested Warframe from over his shoulder, knowing he would 
most likely not hear. The slight curl to the Loki Prime's scarred helm 
caught the backliight glow of the room, and the grisly wounds of 
shrapnel that had gored the Strider's helm seemed to flicker like the 
needle teeth of a cat's smile, or an eel in a brackish pond.<br><br>"My 
brew isn't inherently : toxic, alcoholic... Kicksome. But with enough 
Ruk's Klaw, a drop of Grokdrul..?" Lekalis shrugged, his words turning 
from a staticky rain to a rolling river that poured over every word with
 grace and allure.<br>"... I'm going to see if I can't : rally, grab, 
entice... More fellows to be jolly with.  Shall I count you among them?"
 The Loki Prime shrugged indifferently and eased unto his backfoot as 
his sunny eye flickered and glanced about the party; eyeing other 
members he thought to steal out for some midnight trist.

quieter would be a nice change of pace. Atela shrugged again, getting to
 her feet in one fluid motion. Kamos was much less... graceful about 
this, just preferring to stand up like a normal person. He was never one
 for doing anything even slightly elegant. May as well get to the point,
 right? The two stood side-by-side now, seeming to be on board with 
this.<br><br>"Not sure if tea is a good idea, if it means leaving 
transference. Seems like a few other people are, though." Atela gestured
 around the room, as if to prove her point. No one here who's worked 
with either of the duo would have ever actually seen them as Operators, 
so this might be the first time either of them would willingly shown 
themselves.

 had been since he‚Äôd been able to spend any time with Lekalis. He could 
still hardly believe he had seen him again, after so long!<br><br>‚ÄúWell, you don‚Äôt have to, but Leks is <i>famous</i> among friends for his excellent tea. It‚Äôs worth a sip, if anything.‚Äù Leveret said encouragingly.

over her expression at the initial rejection, but it is short-lived and a
 wordless tug-of-war commences as she hesitantly tugs back with feeble 
strength but overwhelming determination. Taking a deep, shuddering 
breath, Elizabeth deliberately reverses her pull and presses the book up
 into the arms of Disruptis, the red-eyed girl muttering as untamed 
locks of hair drift to shadow half her countenance,</i> <br>"It's ... um ..." <br><i>And
 as though a dam burst, a wave of words wash forth; with every syllable,
 she appears less a girl and far more a dignified lady - nay, a duchess,
 aloof and speaking critically of another ruler.</i><br>"... It is 
literature of the highest caste, penned by authorship long forgotten to 
the ages past; 'tis of forbidden love, much oppressed by all families 
involved; the ending hath bitterness, pain, and death; truly, one might 
correctly scribe that these pages conceal an ageless drama of love, 
romance, and pain..."<br>*On and on she divulges, but one would be 
hard-pressed to call the review 'rambling.' Looking over the book, it is
 savaged by the careless touch of time; battered and worn, this copy 
seems to predate the Orokin Empire entirely. The title is faded and worn
 on the cover, but on the inside is clearly read; 'The Complete Twilight
 Saga, Volumes 1-9, by' here, the authors' names are smudged, but after a
 moment's focus can be discerned, 'Stephen Meyer (1-3), Bram Stoker II 
(4-6), and John Galt (7-9).'<br><br>Settling on her tiptoes, the Tenno 
falls silent as her words are concluded and contents herself to grasp 
the spine of the novel as though supporting its pages, permitting 
Disruptis his 'opening of it,' yet scrutinizing him to ensure nothing 
foul befalls her precious book.*

as his feet dragged him away from the table, hands dubitative to reach 
for each other, his body slowly lured by the ghost at the center of the

against his well-practiced restraint; visage contorted in the struggle 
to discover a fitting expression to match it's master's heart.

there side by side, waiting on everyone else. Kamos had a far more 
relaxed and calm body language than he would ever have normally. Atela, 
meanwhile, looked quite on-edge. Whereas Kamos returned Lekalis' pat 
with his own pat on the shoulder, Atela hesitated quite a bit before 
shaking Lek's hand. She really did give the impression that she didn't 
want to be here at this party. She did extend her own hand in a 
handshake eventually, after making sure Lekalis wasn't a threat at all.<br><br>"Look,
 all I'm saying is that we'll be far more vulnerable without the Frames.
 Chances of some sort of incident injuring or killing someone would be 
significantly higher as an Operator." Atela explained in response to 
Lekalis, in a voice that gave the same impression that she wasn't 
particularly interested in being here. Vaguely annoyed, really. Not at 
Lekalis, just in general. "And now that everyone is drunk, that's only 
going to get even more likely."

lightly,<br>"I agree completely. But..." Lekalis shrugged and patted 
Atela's hand one last time before letting his fingers slip free of her 
grip (his own had been markedly light, in case she so desired to depart 
preemptively from the handshake.)<br><br>The Strider glanced over his 
shoulder to the participants at the center, in their social deleriums, 
they seemed rather distracted... though, like flotsam to a tide, a new 
fellow seemed to be making his way over.<br>Quickly, Lekalis returned his attentions to Atela and his hanging sentence,<br>"...
 But, they seem... shall we say : inebriated, inaccurate." Lekalis 
shrugged again as his sunny eye flickered in some semblence of a wink as
 he reclined back to rest his weight upon one leg, and his arms rested 
easily about his sash yet again.<br><br>"Regardless, you don't have to :
 remove yourself, risk injury, or death. Just some teatime chat, if'n

to Lupin with a small beckoning wave to follow as the Strider continued 
his striding about the room; a familiar warming gaze settling on Ella, 
as Lekalis stared at her as a cat might eye a canary.

                            <b>Muro:</b><br>Muro was caught slightly 
off-guard with Disruptis' sudden appearance, but offered his hand for a 
high five all the same.  He couldn't help but laugh at how upset 
Disruptis was at the crack in the floor. For the life of him, Muro 
couldn't figure why Disruptis would seem so high strung at a time like 
this. Shrugging it off, he couldn't help but smile as Sonera answered 
his call and started bounding towards them. <br>"Well, I think I'll 
leave you two alone. Talk to you later!" Muro started wandering away 
from his Cephalon towards the middle of the room,  As tempting as it was
 to join Vuko and the drinking party that seemed to be kicking off at 
their makeshift bar, Muro didn't share his brother's fondness for 
alcohol. Rather, he strolled towards the growing tea party, which seemed
 the be the tamer of the two options. Drawing close to Lekalis, he tried
 to casually catch the Loki's attention.<br><br>"Hey Lekalis, mind if I join you?"<br><br><b>Aurelia:</b><br>Aurelia
 stood there, quietly grumbling to herself as her Operator went off to 
mingle with the other Tenno scattered throughout the room. She couldn't 
believe that he just... left her there! She didn't have long to dwell on
 those feelings, however, as it took Sonera mere seconds to make it to 
Aurelia's location. As always, the Wukong's boundless enthusiasm both 
impressed and befuddled her. 'Oh well.' She thought to herself, 'At 
least he's willing to help.' Drawing the MOA up to its full height, she 
addressed Sonera.<br><br>"Just Aurelia is fine, Sonera. In truth, I 
could use your help. See these flower arrangements?" She motioned to the
 table, still covered in a dozen or small, but vibrantly colorful 
arrangements of plantlife, held in crystalline vases. "I need some help 
decorating the room with them. Would you mind walking with me as I pick 
out some locations? I would do it myself, but as you can see, I lack the
 ability to carry anything."

relaxed at the acknowledging and welcoming gesture, the secretive calm 
returning to his eyes and lips. He returned with vast steps and a near 
mechanical grace. They leaned closer to Jay'lin, who had yet to make 
their next move.<br><br>"I am afraid you have no more winning moves; and
 while the prospect of a good Komi match with your company is indeed not
 beyond the realm of possibilities, my time, and perhaps yours too, 
would be better spent enjoying a cup of freshly brewed tea." The 
veredict was delivered with no trace of emotion for the opponent they 
considered defeated already, if not for amicable kinship. Without 
further ado, he turned away from Jay'lin once more, silently following 
after the phantom brewer.

 Apologies : I do not recognize you, remember you? Have we met?" Lekalis
 chuckled with some bashful bemusement as he stroked the sash that was 
drawn across his chest.<br><br>"Hmmm..." He noticed Lupin, too, and nodded to the other haunting Tenno that had decided to follow as well. <br>"... You, as well; I don't believe I know your name." Lekalis hummed and then chuckled, shaking his head,<br>"I apologize." He drew out the word with a sweet tune, the statick of his vox offering a hiss like rain to his tenor.

nervously. He could have sworn they had been introduced before, but 
maybe all this time had dulled his recollection of the past.<br><br>"Yeah,
 I'm Muro. I was in the Remnant, same as you. Don't think we ever really
 worked together back then, except at the very end..." Muro visibly 
shuddered. Of all the battles he had been in, that was one he wished he 
could forget.  Just then, a scene from his past flashed into his mind. 
"Wait, do you remember a Tenno named Dormin? I think you and him were 
having an argument a long time ago, and I kind of stumbled into it.  You
 ended up throwing a tea cup at me." Muro chuckled at the memory, 
seeming so far in his past it almost felt fake.  "Gotta say, I was glad 
to hear you survived that last fight with Vey Hek. Gonna need all the 
help I can get to pay that mucker back for what he did."   For a moment,
 Muro's voice dropped from its usual laid-back tone, his words tinged 
with an almost caustic anger. However, the moment left as quickly as it 
came, and Muro's posture visibly relaxed. <br><br>"Ah, but that'll come later. For now, I'd love to try some of that tea you're so famous for."

 spoke and Lekalis listened, that the glowing eye of the Strider waned. 
Like a star seconds before a supernova, the orange light honed in and 
bored into the Tenno with the intensity of a gamma ray burst.<br>"I remember : Dormin, an argument. The Remnant... a massacre." He muttered quietly, his joviality seemingly snuffed as he spoke,<br>"I did not survive : Fire, and blood... An ocean of rust and dead harvest. A Corpse, a Glint, an Eater..."<br><br>Lekalis shuddered and his fingers wriggled, the sunny eye seemed to refocus,<br>"...
 No, the Remnant died. So did those memories." He affirmed with a 
growing spriteness to his tone as his good hand rose and twisted the 
cylinders jutting out from his occular aide, his gills hissed out some 
excess heat and he stalked onwards, past Muro.<br>"I don't believe you 
have tried my tea : I hope you did not drink the tea I threw." He hummed
 with a small chuckle, the flicker of before all but forgotten as he 
produced some iron cups in the palm of his hand and let each begin to 
orbit his person as he strode on.

 toothy smirk creaking past his lips before quickly dissipating into a 
faint curve.<br><br>"In the olden times of war and empires, perchance, 
we have crossed paths." He picked up on the prior topic, re-introducing 
himself as he closed the gap with the group. "If it were, you must 
forgive me, for it escapes my memory too. And were it not the case, it 
would be a pleasure to make your acquaintance nonetheless." He offered a
 handshake, his palm turned slightly up to expose his arm. "You may call
 me Lupin, if it would please you. And should your memory fail you, you 
will find no lack of kinship every time you were to pose that question."
 He added in an attempt to put the battle-worn Loki at ease.<br><br>"Either
 of you, that is." He said, extending the prior introduction to Muro, 
though their offer of a hand shake would have to wait.

hollow stare. His orange pupils correlating towards the steel-wall with 
perhaps festive decoration. Something ticked in his head vigorously, 
this tapping in the walls. It pecked slowly with a metaphorical finger 
inside, the sound like a finger repeatedly poking a chalkboard. <br><br>||Wall||<br><br>‚ÄúIn

repeated. The wall beckoning Jay‚Äôlin over like a toy to a child. Nobody

sharp scream was heard, a lot of screams and the sounds of fire coming 
from the wall; yet only Jay‚Äôlin saw this. <br><br>||Jay‚Äôlin|| <br><br>He
 was staring with bewilderment; obscure thought twisting his brain waves
 before he mumbled towards himself. ‚ÄúNot again...‚Äù as he‚Äôd use his

chant something in his head, <br><br>‚ÄúOne, two... away, one, two... away...‚Äù  <br><br>He‚Äôd
 begin saying in a whisper like voice as the banging and screaming got 
louder, before it all halted. His eyes widening as the sounds came to an
 absolute halt, he stared at his Komi board and realized he had lost; 
his breathing faster then usual as he‚Äôd simply close the Komi board up 
and begin to just slump in his seat, relaxing. Trying to cooperate from 
his mind playing tricks.

sort of disregarded it. They didn't really say anything else, really 
just sticking with this group of people. A lot of people wanted some 
tea, apparently. Or maybe it was just the oppritunity to get away from 
the loud, drunk party everyone else here was having.

                            /Lekalis/<br><br>"Ah, perhaps we did!" He 
agreed to Lupin cheerily, The Strider's half-horn helm cocked back to 
glance at the Tenno's dusk berry hued eyes that did glimmer with only 
the barest of differences to a memory of somber, stable, and satisfiying
 times. It was enough to hold Lekalis' attentions for a time to bow his 
brow in kind to the introductions.<br><br>"Lupin, Lupin : noble, fierce,
 yet friendly. A good name..." He commented kindly as his good hand 
reached out to clasp Lupin's hand before pausing, the fingers twitched 
away and rested aside from the Operator's hand, while a familiar flicker
 and slumber settled over the Strider's form.<br>As before, a pale limb 
misted out from his Warframe; phantasmal in the staticky glow of its 
white skin. Albeit, it looked to be more... solid than before. The jade 
band about his wrist and elbow shone more apparently, and the red ribbon
 between them was markedly bold in its hue.<br><br>Lekalis' long fingers
 and slight extensions of limb were all the more apparent as his fingers
 curled delicately about Lupin's hand. Soft like silk, the digits had a 
density more like a porcelain doll than flesh and bone.<br>"... The 
pleasure is mine, Lupin." He spoke at last as the hand, as delicate as 
it seemed, managed to shake Lupin's hand with grace and fluidity that 
inspired some soothe in Lupin's own skin. It was almost euphoric; 
acupuncture, somatic therapy, or herbal remedies all seemed so... 
pointless in the wake of the undeniable Vazarin sooth that flowed out 
from the Strider's hand.<br>[1/2]

therein vanished as Lekalis hand slipped away like water, and found 
refuge back in the battered Loki Prime, which now powered up again.<br>The
 Strider's Sunny eye didn't leave Lupin's own as Lekalis' hands moved to
 produce several iron cups from his sash; 6 in total, 3 in each hand. He
 held them up to Leveret, which now took the Strider's attention to look
 at the comrade at his shoulder,<br>"That would be wise, Leveret; take 
these beneath the window... take Kamos and Atela over as well : 
comrades, Ceres... You three have much to catch up on, I think."<br><br>Just
 as long as the introduction seemed, The Strider's motions now had him 
moving on and towards Ella in no real haste as he kept his helm faced 
conversationally towards Lupin, should he follow still.

them as they scoured the surface of the scarred warframe, yet the

the conversation to regain his stoic focus, as he followed Lekalis

Leveret, he let the three teacups hover off from his Warframe in a trail
 for the Frost to pickup later, as Lekalis slipped two of the iron cups 
still remaining back into his sash. In the same stroke, his freed 
fingers plucked out a root and flower of Ruk's Klaw; both were set into 
the last cup and were crunched beneath his thumb. Ground to a paste and 
powder that still didn't stick to the Strider's thumb.<br><br>"I watched
 a Glint on the Red Sea. The way debris lingers : pecked by birds and 
scorched by sun upon the surface, fish beneath the waves, a return to 
sediment and soil." Lekalis waxed on poetically as he produced the iron 
canister yet again, in his prosthetic; the cap flicked off but was 
caught between to careful fingers before it fell. The tendons of the 
prosthetic limb moved with their own rigid grace, as they held the 
canister and poured it into the iron cup while Lekalis scarcely missed a
 beat in his stride towards Ella.<br>There was the barest sense of 
urgency noticeable in his longer steps, and in how he broke the simple 
speaking distance he'd retained with Lupin t'ill now.<br>"The tea is 
easy. The people are... difficult." He added over his shoulder as he 
approached Ella, teacup in his palm with his thumb stirring it in fair 
haste.<br><br>The Strider cast out a message as he neared Ella's flank,<br><div class="pre pre--multilineLek">[Tea?]<br></div><br>The
 brew had rapidly eskewed in colors white and green and now white again,
 with a subtle whorl of green to its nature. A familiar and sharp scent 
wafted away from the warming tea, a scent alike to dried mint leaves 
floating on milk.<br><br>Lekalis turned halfly to Lupin  and motioned for him to keep a distance.

seemed the music was no longer his concern. As Kapak turned to Disruptis
 a cyan mist enveloped the Tenno, his warframe suddenly replacing his 
body. Now as Ivara, he lifted the glass up to his visor and with a 
curious look eyed it. <br><br>Then, out of nowhere he rotated 270 
degrees and chucked the glass at insanely high speeds towards the Loki.

again at Kamos and Atela, motion caught his eye as a bottle flew through
 the air. Had he been closer, he would have tried to block the

watch as it whizzed by Lekalis' half-destroyed helm.<br><br>Leveret's 
jolly excitement bubbled with traces of anger as he fumbled the cups 
onto the closest surface - whether it be someone's hands or a table, he 
didn't care - and roughly set down his own bottle nearby.<br><br>"Who threw that?" He called to the party at large, moving to help Lekalis clean up the mess.

 over to Disruptis made him hesitate. Even without seeing him throw the

offering hand held against his chest, he closed the gap, eyes held on 
her recoiling visage, searching for signs of discomfort. Cautious 
fingertips reached out and were held just shy of contact.<br><br>"A 
fore-warning: I will use void energy to ensure no further harm befalls 
you." He added, taking a brief moment to let her adjust and respond, as 
the misty energy rolled over his skin, slothful dusk wisps reaching out 
to Ella from his outreached hands.<br><br>He tested her reaction with 
the gentle tap of the back of two fingers against  the scalp behind the 
prongs. A brief analitical pause anticipated his attempt to delicately 
guide the mechanical sensors with one hand, the other focused on 
locating and extracting the stranded saboteurs.<br><br>Eyes shone 
brightly as he continued to channel the void, sending the sommatic scars
 that framed his face into a writhing frenzy that appeared to remain 
undetected by their host.

 sending Dr. Frost to a quick demise. Even the walls warped and bent

was a crack.<br><br>Or rather: an orange gaping hole outlined in yellow that spanned the width of the entire ceiling.<br><br>Inside

                            <b>Muro:</b><br>The lack of explanation of 
Disruptis' part was aggravating, to say the least. As more and more 
people joined their conversation, all of whom seemed to know a lot more 
about what was going on than he did. In this instance, however, he 
didn't have time to sulk. The explosion that rocked the room sent Muro 
flying back towards the wall, the durability of his Hydroid frame the 
only reason the shock didn't knock him unconscious. Immediately his eyes
 were drawn to the fiery rift that had appeared in the ceiling. Muro 
hadn't the slightest clue what it was, but his instincts told him one 
thing: RUN. <br><br>"Aurelia!" he practically screamed into his comm 
link. " Get the Liset to my location, now! Cut a hole into the station 
if you have to!"  Her response was immediate.<br><br><b>Aurelia:</b><br>"Already
 on its way, darling!" Truly, it was in times of crisis where Muro and 
Aurelia worked best together. No sass, no time for jokes, just solid 
teamwork. In truth, the shock of the fissure opening up had completely 
fried the MOA proxy she had been using. Like her Operator, she had no 
idea what caused it, but one thing was clear: it was time to leave. 
Within moments the Liset was docked on the side of the station, a myriad
 of tools working at cutting through the thick outer walls of the 
station. "Muro, its going to take me a moment to make an opening. Look 
for a hole along the eastern wall of the room!"

                            <b>Muro:</b><br>"Got it!" he barked back, 
trying to brace himself against the pull of the fiery void that loomed 
above him.  Muro looked around the room at the various faces he knew in 
the room, his family amongst them. He couldn't lose them. Not again. 
Summoning up all the strength he could, he let out a yell that he could 
only hope would be heard above the roar of the rift. <br><b>"VUKO! KAPAK! LEKS! EVERYONE! GET TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE ROOM! NOW!"</b>
 The panicked yell shook Muro to his core, though he wasn't sure it even
 reached the others.  All he could do now was pull himself towards the 
designated wall, hoping that Aurelia could breach the wall before the 
entire station came down on them.

 just watching this party, when all of this stuff happened. One second, 
it was just a loud party. The next second, though... The two knew what 
to do. They had spent countless hours preparing for almost every 
eventuality. This was no different. I mean, there was still a moment of 
panic as both were knocked off balance, but Atela managed to keep Kamos 
on his feet when he nearly tripped. Now holding onto the wall as things 
got worse and worse, Kamos glanced at the window and nodded to Atela.<br><br>"EVERYONE
 SHOULD HOLD ONTO SOMETHING!" Kamos shouted, before... kicking the 
window into a bunch of tiny shards and exposing them to space. 
Immediately, the decompression launched the two of them out of the 
station. Just like Sedna, yep. Well, part of that mission. The both of 
them held onto each other, as Atela focused on making contact with their
 liset and getting their Archwings over here. At most, they had a few 
minutes before the life support on their frames failed, and they would 
be forced out of transference. Nope, they weren't losing their frames 
like this.
