    <em>A still half-asleep Vuko was slowly making his way out of the hangar, visually having a problem walking, and navigating in general. For some odd reason he was wearing nothing but boxers, and his hair was let loose in a weird array, as if he had to fight off a flock of condorcs. Just as he made his way to the intersection, the wild noises started causing him to lower his head and start massaging his temples, while he mumbled under his nose.</em> - &quot;zaraza... those damn monkeys can&#39;t even behave in the morning...&quot; - <em>And just as he finished, the Nidus burst out of the lab, screaming atop his lungs. The startled Vuko jumped up in surprise, and in a fit of revenge, screamed back towards the closed lab doors.</em> - &quot;MIND YOUR TONE, KAPAK! SOME OF US ARE TRYING TO SUFFER IN PEACE HERE!&quot; - <em>He responded, knowing that he probably won&#39;t hear him.</em> - &quot;Infested buffoon...&quot; - <em>He added under his nose, while still trying to massage the headache away.</em>
     <em>Somehow the stumbling Tenno made his way into the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water, and after staring at it for half a minute decided to drink straight from the bottle he poured it out of, quickly downing almost two liters of water. After rummaging through the kitchen a bit more he managed to find a plate of brownies, which he took without a second thought and headed back to the lounge, while stuffing his face full of the chocolate goodness. With a loud &#39;thump&#39; he jumped onto the couch, causing the Kuria to bounce off into the middle of the floor, but Vuko didn&#39;t see that, as he was too consumed with the plate of sweets.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">~The noise inside the barracks freezes instantly as the furious Nidus and the fatiqued boy yell. The culprits inside stagnating, like children getting yelled at by their parents. Even after a moment, whoever is inside dared not move or make any other noise. Then, hurried shuffling is heard, followed my muffled speaking, and then some bangs, some slaps and scampering steps.

The door of the barracks hisses to open and a Feyarch Oberon peeks out to the hallway, holding a stretched out Verida suit, with the legs on it slobbered and gnawed on, in his right hand.~

Devros von Inie
The boy looks back inside the barracks, where a furous kubrow is glaring at him

“Oi said i’ll be back in two &#39;ours tops! Besides, yer can’t folly me dare, yer nu waaat &#39;appened de last time. An&#39; stayin&#39; &#39;ere &#39;ill be more craic for yer.”

The kubrow, still glaring, sits on his rump by Devros’ bed which is really trashed. Speaking of, if anyone dares look inside the barracks they will come across a battlefield. The bed sheets are scattered, the pillow stuffing is in the air, clothes on the floor, and the wall above Devros’ bed have hoof markings.

The Oberon smiles and nods at Garhul, stepping out in to the hallway to let the door to the barracks close. He tip toes around to the bio lab but halts just before the door sensors activate and open. “Let him cool off? Yeah!”

He looks down to the suit in his hand and sighs. When Garhul tugs on something he TUGS. His suit looks like it could fit Kapak now. Throwing the jumpsuit over his right shoulder he looks down the hall leading to the living room and notices the battered Tenno just walking back from the kitchen. With hurried clanks of his hoofed feet, the Oberon walks over to the couch and plops down with his elbows on the back rest of the couch just next to Vuko.

“&#39;eya! So um…enjoy de sweets, and um…are ya good?”

He eyes the other Tenno’s current state, completely missing the Kuria on the floor</span>

The flowery warframe eyes the plate of cookies and smiles, straightening up and with a buzz of golden energy the messy haired boy steps out. The tall, beefy looking Tenno which is only dressed in a very wide and loose shirt that hangs like a old bag on his body and a pair of equally pants (which overall might make him look like one of those shroom loving airheads), snags one of the cookies and leaps over the back end of the couch in one fluid motion to sit next to Vuko, leaving his Oberon to stand still behind him. He chomps down on it and starts chewing. His greenish golden eyes widen as he twirls his head to look back at Vuko through his busted glasses.

“Oooooh. Dis is gran&#39;.Kili? i’ll &#39;av ter &#39;unt dat lass down fer de recipe”

The dark haired boy smirks as he looks over his shoulder to the Verida suit that is slaunched over his Oberon’s shoulder. With a shrug, he looks back at the almost fully naked colleague and says in his raspy voice

“Aye yeah. oi &#39;av sum business ter take care av an&#39; he can’t go dare so he got the bleedin&#39; full shillin&#39; an&#39; wanted ter stop me. He did dis to me suit an&#39; tried ter hide somethin&#39; oi nade….which I…”

He trails off as he spots the Kuria on the floor from the corner of his eye.

“AHA!”

He exclaims and hops off the couch to snatch the shiny thing examining it for marks, but then pauses, freezing as he turns to look at Vuko with a confused look

“Wait, &#39;owl on, &#39;angover? it’s 12 in de afternoon!”</span>

The boy let out a low chuckle 

“Pedlek? Dat goon can chucker somethin&#39; other than nap? Oi &#39;aven’t seen &#39;imself git oyt av &#39;is chair in forever”

He smirked, obviously joking. Devros turned around with the Kuria in one hand and the half eaten cookie in the other. In one smooth motion, he slumps down back on the couch next to Vuko, sinking deep in the cushions and making himself comfortable. He smirks at the other Tenno and will throw the Kuria over to him. If caught, Vuko will notice – if he came in to contact with one of these before – that this one feels a bit off. The weight, color and shape are all the same but it’s like something is missing from the complete package, a certain tone.

Devros throws the rest of the cookie in his gluttonous maw and wipes his lips with the back of his hand before he spoke again

“Dat, me ticket in de Cobalt Needle Syndicate aucshun house. Tart Garhul wud &#39;av &#39;id it in de flower scratcher by de &#39;angar…phew! An&#39; no bite marks, double phew” (Tart – thought)

Devros leans on the backrest of the couch with his left elbow, resting his chin in his opened palm to observe Vuko’s reaction with a amused expression. It’s like watching a puppy explore a new toy, sniffing around it, cautious but interested, seeing if it&#39;s edible. Cute. He runs a palm through his wild, puffy hair and says in his raspy voice

“Yeah, it’s somethin&#39; loike a shiny Orokin ornament, but it’s not rayle. It’s a pure gran&#39; lookalike tho”

He smirked. It was the perfect knock-off, apart from the fact that it didn’t have the ability to produce melodic tones as of yet, but Devors has a way of going around that

“Aye! A place wha odd an&#39; valuable things pop up. Oi &#39;av been dare a couple av times an&#39; oi can’t even describe de feelin&#39;. it pulls yer in ya know?!”

His muddy golden eyes lit up with excitement as he speaks, trying to physically show what he is saying by pulling imaginary reigns towards himself. Vuko can clearly see the passion in Devros’ expression, as if he’s speaking from the soul…maybe a bit too vigorously.

“Oi mean so&#39;tiz kind av shady but that’s waaat makes it entertainin&#39;.”

He paused for a moment, looking over the other Tenno

Devros snags the ornament straight from the air and looks up at Vuko with a shrug

“De profit is not in me gain nigh. Oi jist want ter git in!”

He smirks and throws the Kuria in the air, towards the still Oberon. Swiftly transferring to it, he snatches the Kuria off the air with his metallic hand before it had time to start falling. Devros, now in his Oberon Prime, nods towards Vuko

“Yer can meet me by de &#39;angar den, I’ll pay our resident butcher – oi mean &#39;ealer a visit…err ter clap if &#39;e’s still not the full shillin&#39; aboyt de &#39;ustle dat went on in de barracks.

The Oberon smirks and shakes his head as the boy returns for the cookie. He watches Vuko hop along and then just heads out himself, heading towards the bio lab. With tiny clanks of his hoofed feet, he makes his way to the door and with a loud “whoosh” sound of the sliding door, indicates his arrival.

The Oberon pokes his head inside to try and spot the infested fellow.

“Oy! Pak pak! Naw &#39;ard feelings aye? Aboyt de um..noise an&#39; such”

He steps inside the lab, letting the door shut behind him</span>

Kapak is sitting in the corner of the room with his legs folded, his face regarding a... decapitated Grineer head. A twisting cyclone of pipes and tubes snaked into the underside of the head.
“Ah? Of course no hard feelings! Of course not! I’ve just been working on this for the last 8 hours straight and needed to be able to hear. Listen!”
As Kapak went silent, Devros could hear...
...well, nothing.
“Wonderful, isn’t it?” Kapak grinned. “I never thought that it would be possible!” He poked the head on the cheek playfully as if it were a child.</span>

Devros eyes the severed head not with a “WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU” gaze but with a intrigued and curious look. Is he doing the headless kubrow experiment? The boy read articles of the procedure, of how to keep a severed head living long enough for it to be transferred on to a new body. But…that’s old science!

He walks towards the infested fellow and the grineer head, perking his ears as the other said to listen. But…nothing happens. Huh?

He leans closer and still nothing.

“Is de silence waaat i’m supposed ter &#39;ear or…am oi losin&#39; me &#39;earin&#39; again.”

He chuckled thinking of all of the times his Lenz blew up under him causing his ears to ring for weeks. Good thing injuries don’t stick that long on the void tainted</span>

The severed head&#39;s eyes darted towards Devros&#39; own face before opening its mouth and screaming.
&quot;TENNO SKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
The head yelled so hard that it tipped over backwards, unplugging several of the tubes from the underside and causing the head to become lifeless again.

<u>Kapak:</u>
The Nidus stood there confused. &quot;What the Void....? It&#39;s never done that before. Did I somehow restore its consciousness somehow....?&quot;
He coughed awkwardly before standing the head back up and sticking the tubing back in. &quot;I was experimenting with using small infested tumors to carry information,&quot; he explained, turning the head around to reveal a small, mushroom like pip sticking out behind its ear, &quot;it vibrates in a certain pattern and basically whispers information. Not entirely practical right now, but just a fun little project.&quot;</span>

OH SHHHHH. The Oberon instinctively reeled back as the head yelled right at him. Talk about jump scares! He froze with one hand held in front of him as a shield and one dropping down to his hip for the Sonicor. Geeeze!  He blinked once, then twice and let out a cackle, his frame relaxing and slightly shaking from the laughter.

“Ey! Almost made me jump oyt av me suit.”

He stepped closer to the head again and looked at the tubing. Devros is a man of biology so this kind of thing interests him greatly. Information relayed through flesh and tumors? Now isn’t that a amusing thought. You can turn hoards in to messengers, chargers in to carriers, and those flying fart spilling cunts in to megaphones or some sort. He tilts his head to the side, as he watched the Nidus put the tubing back in place, his greedy eyes slurping up everything about the project.

“Gotta say, that’s sum messed up informashun port yer got dare. but…wouldn’t others nade &#39;elmith to-

He paused mid sentence as if he’s listening to someone speaking. 

“Ahhhh! so&#39;tiz time already?!”

He lifts his left palm, facing it upwards and from it he projects a solar clock which indicates that it’s soon to be 12:30.

“Feck, oi &#39;ill be late.”

He disperses the projection and lifts his head to look at the Nidus

“Unless dat tin&#39; really needs yisser attenshun, we can continue dis on de way aye? Oi &#39;av a date wi&#39; Amalthea on Jupiter, a aucshun gaff ter attend, can’t miss it!”

He boomed with excitement, waiting to see what the Nidus says</span>

“An auction, you say?” The light twinkled off of the red crown of his head, emulating a sparkle in his eye. “Sounds... interesting!”
He whirled about, rummaging through a nearby cabinet until he pulled out a handful of fake moustaches.
“Count me in! I wouldn’t mind rummaging through old dusty artifacts without having to dive balls-deep into a Derelict!”
Kapak picked up the now talking head and placed in the corner of the bio lab, hopefully in a place where it’s babbling wouldn’t disturb anyone.
“Oi, Mephalus! Gorrus, you too! Watch the bio lab, make sure that experiment 434-D gets its nutrient supply refilled!” Kapak pointed to the corner of the bio lab where Devros would’ve been able to see two of Kapak’s engineers playing an improvised game of Komi using bullet casings as the stones. They nodded absentmindedly in response to the Nidus.
“Right! Let us go, then!”</span>

“All the time! Sometimes!”
He waved his hand at the Oberon and turned back towards his workstation and began to wipe down the surface with a cloth he procured from another drawer.
“I’ll just finish sanitizing the lab and I’ll meet with you at the place- it’s probably for the best, since I don’t want Boss man breathing down my arse anymore than he already is. Don’t worry though, I’ll be right behind you! Just transmit the location to me and I’ll see you there!”</span>

“Pure, clap yer dare”

He rounds around the corner but then remembers something and quickly pokes his head through the bio lab to say

“Maybe try an&#39; fend a trench coat? Jist a suggesshun!”

But, the others vigorous and eager questions had him pause mid step to his way to his run down and dull Scmitar landing craft. If warframes had brows then the Oberon’s would definetlly furrow as he lifts his expressionless face towards Vuko

“&#39;ooooauld up dare mucker”

He starts walking towards the other, his right hand raised as a mock stop indicator to the other

“Either yer got de wrong idea or yer are really itchin&#39; for sum craic, aye? Dis is a friendly gatherin&#39; fer trinket enthusiasts. We ain’t stealin&#39; but participatin&#39;. &#39;owever…”

He stops in front of the mannered boy and leans forward a bit so that his face is on level with the others

…disorder isn’t dat uncommon.”

He playfully smirks and straightens up.  Well...that was a bit of a lie but there is something that is supposed to be at that auction that Devros is not leaving without and if that means causing a scene and/or stealing it then so be it. Twirling on his hoofs he heads back towards his landing craft, speaking over his shoulder on the way

“Yer can join me on me orbiter or folly wi&#39; yisser own, make it snappy! We be behind schedule!”</span>

The Oberon pauses for a split second as the talk of his beloved companion came up

“A-ah, Garhul &#39;ill not be comin&#39;, last time oi did, it caused a bit av a ruckus wi&#39; de auctioneers..”

He shrugged as he stepped inside his landing craft and stepping to the side for Vuko to enter in to the cramped space

“Oy wus oi ter nu dat &#39;is pelt is dat valuable?”

He chuckled under his breath and as soon as Vuko (and the mysterious lurker) strap on he will flick the switch and lift off, projecting the hunk of metal towards his Orbiter that is hanging on the outskirts of Lua</span>

Amalthea on Jupiter is no a popular place, it’s just a Corpus Gas City built for harvesting the resourses in the atmosphere of this powerful planet. You’d think that mostly those that are mad or those whose greed knows no bound find themselves here, to work in this harsh environment. Either though punishment or vision, you are here – but! Not today!

Today is a very special day for those that call Amalthea their home/work place, it is a time when the Cobalt Needle Syndicate opens their floating auction house to all…well to all that know of the event. They are not very known by the general public nor do they want to be, but they did build a reputation for themselves among small circles as the best scavengers on this side of the galaxy. Is there a unopened vault somewhere? You can bet your skooma – I mean credits that they have cracked it by now. Is that a Tenno Orbiter floating out here? Zoinks! They have it in their hangar. A unknown Orokin artifact existing somewhere? Yup, it’s in their inventory. Risk their crazy lives to get a data mass that contains the thoughts of a Oroking researcher from a infested ship? Oh look, it’s in their hands. They work for their own gain, answering to none and caring about none too for all they care are recovering and selling anything that looks old or mysterious enough. Time is credits and these fellas are selling theirs for steep prices.</span>

Once every eight years the Cobalt Needle open their floating auction house to those that know of it, each time parking it by various stations to refill the heavy ship before it jettisons off for years of scavenging.  The floating auction house itself is just a retrofitted Corpus war ship to contain +40 levels of storage units and hangar bays that get filled up with a very varying degree of items. And of course, the multiple auction rooms that are lined across the top floor where they sell most of their findings to the highest bidder and everyone knows – or at least, those that are in such circles – that the Cobalt Needle Syndicate never disappoints, they offer some of the most intriguing and unique items, most that you get to see only once in your lifetime in their auction houses before some rich bastard takes it. 

There are no invitations going out to call for participants for it is not some common open house where just anyone can waltz in and bid, oh no! Currency circles around this by the millions and not many are willing nor have that kind of amount on them. The Cobalt Needle is a syndicate that cares not for small fries, it’s either you bet big or go home. But, as all interesting things, words spreads fast about it and each docking more and more people gather to witness the exotic it holds onboard. Invitations are not needed anymore when you attract them just by existing – now that is a business goal.</span>

And, being chosen as the refueling station for such a event is something akin to a honor among the Corpus that know of it, cause it attracts a lot of wealthy Condors up to your doorsteps where you can charge them anything you like for the parking fee and other trinkets or even sell them the nasty rations that they eat on a daily basis. It’s like New Year…if it cost billions.

As Devros’ Orbiter approaches Jupiter, Vuko can see from the window inside the messy haired boys private quarters (where the tour of the ship brought them) a massive ship, almost the size of the Gas City itself, floating alongside it with three tubes connecting Amalthea to the floating auction house. In appearance it looks vaguely like any other brigade but the paint alongside it is pitch black with a name alongside the left side in off-white that reads “Harlegand” Two copies of the same glyph resting on both sides of the ship that descript a yellow Kuaka that is being pierced through the head by a cobalt colored needle. There is no mistaking it, the floating auction house has arrived already and Vuko can see that things on Amalthea are very different from what he’s used to seeing.</span>

The entire Gas City is overflowing with ships, some Corpus, some Grineer, even other Tenno Orbiters are resting around the busy docking areas. Even through Jupiters clouds, Vuko can see a lot of bussle and hussle going on at the surface of the City, as if the entire station just transformed from a resourse outpost to a entertainment and shopping center. Vendors out and about selling their poor trinkets, food being distributed through flimsy cups, parking officers keeping a eye on the docking ships and well dressed people walking through it all towards one of the entry tubes. It is clearly one heck of a event. Of course, seeing as how there are many races mingling about the security is tighter than ever and there are drones watching everything from above, keeping a eye on public peace.</span>

Devros von Inie
“Glorious, is it not?!”

Devros squeals out, now out of his Oberon and dressed in his standard Varida suit, the excitement evident in his voice and gleaming golden/emerald eyes. This will be his second trip to the Harlegand ,and just as the first time, he finds himself unable to contain the bubbling itch. There is no erasing the wonders he has seen onboard that ship eight years ago and he’s sure that the same thing awaits him this time as well. He glances at Vuko from the corner of his eyes to see the others expression but coaxes him otherwise

“Com, com! we &#39;ill be landin&#39; soon!”

He turns to make his way out of his jungle like quarters. There are vines coiling alongside the walls, the floor – that was once usually metal – is now riddled with grass and flowers. The fish tanks beaming with activity and there are many caged Kuaka on the shelves of the room. Then again, that’s how most of his ship looks like so his quarters is nothing special…there is just less grass everywhere than in here and he’s still unsure as to how his traveling companion managed such a feat but he avoids asking such questions – just let her do what she wants as long as she keeps breeding those delicious animals!

The excited Tenno exits his room and heads across his flora infested ship to the Navigator. He meets his traveling companion – the always present Titania specter – tending to a patch of Moonlight Jadeleaf near the relic refinement segment. He gives her a simple nod and stomps towards the large window to see everything in far greater width.</span>

He glances towards Vuko and smirks

“It waz…from waaat oi &#39;eard de aucshun gaff started from de back alleys av Venus. A couple av desperate Solaris jist itchin&#39; for sum queck earnin&#39; ter pay bak deir debt as fast as possable an&#39; well…word got oyt, it expanded, they bought dis ship &#39;ere they are nigh, pullin&#39; in sum av de richest masses in de sytum.”

He returns his gaze towards the window as the Orbiter flies around the station, maneuvering around the other flying ships. He leans over the navigator and punches in a couple of commands to keep the orbiter steady since he has no Cephalon at the moment to automatically do it.

“Oh…they &#39;av almost al&#39; av their &#39;aul in a digital list, easy ter fend things dere…if yer nu waaat yer are lookin&#39; for…if not den somethin&#39; might fend yer!”

He playfully winks at the other before looking back at his sensors.

“Betta leave it at de outskirts,  we &#39;ill drop down via craft.”

Devros twirls on his heels and heads down towards his landing craft. Along the way, as he passes his foundry system, he pulls out from it the Kuaka arfiact that Vuko has seen before and boards his vessel, he will wait for Vuko before departing towards the gas city.

“Ah and…if anyone asks…ye work fer me. &#39;opin&#39; not a problem aye?”

He will offer another playful wink, but this one more silly as his whole face twists down to pull that one eyelid making him look sort of comical</span>

His head reels back in disbelief as the other didn’t know of the Solari. Has he been going out?! Or Mata keeping a tighter leash? Then again, this system is vast and people live out their lives on one planet let alone know what’s going on 4 moons away. The glasses wearing Tenno closes the entrance of the landing craft as soon as Vuko stepped in. While punching in some of the commands, he speaks over his shoulder to Vuko

“Paddy, after dis oi’m takin&#39; yer dare ter clap fer yerself, nu av a class boozer dare dat is alwus lively.”

He pauses and turns to look towards Vuko, eying the other from the tips of his hair to the soles of his boots, as if looking for something with that intense golden gaze of his. Then, with a smile, he turns his head back towards the navigation and continues his button pressing as he speaks in his dense accent.

“Oi’m sure yer &#39;ill loike it.”

He smirks and braces as the Scimitar craft whirrs and ejects from the Orbiter, wiggling towards the Gas City. The smooth ride doesn’t take too long for it to reach the landing area of the floating outpost, maybe 2 min at best.

A light shake tumbles across the landing craft as it hits the ground and the doors twirl open to reveal the overcrowded hangar that was once the naked roof of the outpost, but now fitted to house ships of all sizes and designs. It’s a very crowded assortment despite it being out in the open. The walkways on the other hand are as barren as a desert since everyone have already scurried inside the auction house. Not a soul in sigh apart from the workers that are shuffling about checking who paid what parking fee and checking the elevators that are lined up against the left corner. The travel miles these elevators have traveled now...

Devros steps out of his craft, smiling like a little kid, and turns to Vuko with his eyes bright of excitement</span>

He twirls around on his heels with the grace of a tango dancer, to look towards the walkways. Narrowing his eyes, he frowns and mutters under his breath

“Oi swear, if &#39;e’s still back at de base oi won’t let ‘im ayt me cookin&#39; nomore.”

*Devros pursed his lips as the vocal Cephalon spoke through his pad. ”Never git used ter dat voice.” He chuckled under his breath as he called the elevator. It didn’t take it that long to come up and with a ding it announces it’s arrival. The messy haired boy speaks to the Cephalon as he gets on

“Trollied already &#39;uh? Well…tell &#39;imself ter wait fer us in de catalogue room…. if yer man passed by de chicken&#39;s greg” (check point)

As soon as Vuko (and the mysterious invisible presence) get on, he will press the lowest button on it to start the descend. Unless the Cephalon has anything to say to him, he will shut off the data pad and pocket it in one of the leg pockets he made in his suit. If it’s one thing that Devros hates about the current state of the Tenno wardrobe is that they all LACK POCKETS!

“Let’s &#39;ope yer man didn’t trash anythin&#39; aye?”

---A couple of seconds later and the elevator slows down, jerking at the stop and with a hiss the door opens. Devros and Vuko will be presented in to a long, very lit corridor, and at the end of it is a terminal upon which two Corpus guars sat at, dressed in black jumpsuits with purple linings.---

Devros von Inie
“Oi assume yer did as oi towl an&#39; lef anythin&#39; deadly on board?”

He eyes the other from the corner of his vision as he started walking towards the check point.</span>

He narrows his twinkling eyes at his friend&#39;s choice of tone when he spoke. His gaze traveling across his form as if looking for anything concealed in his robes, but seeing no unusual bulges anywhere he shrugs his shoulders and walks on.

“Damn! Never pegged you as a lazy fella. Draft already started“

 Spoke the bright purple one in a slurry rough tone as if he’s speaking through rubble. He drops his hands to grab on to both sides of his hip, his posture relaxed and calm. You can almost feel the smirk resting behind his helmet.

Devros von Inie
The glasses wearing Tenno puffed air through his nose, a smirk of matching sass spreading across his face

“Even after al&#39; dees years, ye still on chicken&#39;s greg point duty? Waaat? Didn’t collect enoof points fer a upgrade?“

The black jumpsuit wearing Corpus let out a grumble that can be both interpreted as a very grumpy laugh or another more deeper scoff…my money is on the later. He uncoils his right hand from their previous lock across his chest and waves it in the air in a dismissive manner.

“Anyways, you know the drill and…”

He trailed off as he lifts his helmet, his cyan visor falling on Vuko

“Who’s this?”

Devros von Inie
With that dumb smile of his, he lifts his palm up and will roughly slap it on the others shoulder

“Dis is me new scrounger. Gran&#39; wan too, managed ter fend dis fer me”

He lifts his palm from Vuko to dig through his makeshift pockets and pull out the Kuria, throwing it towards the guard.

Corpus guard 1
He snatches the ornament from the air in one smooth motion and brings it closer towards his visor

“Oooooh! This is a treat indeed! Haven’t seen that many of em, and with a low pitch too”

He twirls it around his hand for a moment before handing it over to his partner.

“Run that through”

He orders and the other quickly scurries towards the terminal to put it through the scanner that determines if it’s a fake or not.

“This is a much better pawn than that garbage from last time, what was it? A Paris prime bow?”

The lighter purpled guard spoke through a grin as he unclenched his pocked scanner and stepped to the side, motioning for Vuko to step up towards him with a coaxing gesture of his hand.

“Hope he told you about the policy here eh? Don’t worry, light check up cause we can’t have every rabble rouser bringing in weapons in there, not after the dock at Lua.”(edited)</span>

<strong>Corpus guard 1</strong>
He turned on the scanner and started to run it up and down the boys body, looking for any outlines that might point to possible hidden weapons. The jagged construction of his armor did raise a eyebrow but the scanner didn’t pick up on any real danger…even thought he’s sure that the Tenno can poke a eye out with those shoulders.

Satisfied with the scan, the turns it off and straightens up, taking two steps backwards from Vuko

“Alright, you’re clean…but careful with those pointy things eh?”

<strong>Devros</strong>
The messy haired fellow smirked and slapped the shoulder of the Corpus guard in a playful manner

“Don’ worry! &#39;e’s gran&#39;! as scon as I”

<strong>Corpus guard 1</strong>
He scoffed and shook his shoulder

“I’ll humor you, just cause I know you’re not stupid enough to bring in weapons”

<strong>Devros</strong>
He chuckled under his breath

“Awwww oi knew yer &#39;ad &#39;eart.”

<strong>Corpus guard 2</strong>
Before the other had a chance to throw a backlash to that, the guard scanning the Kuria lifts his head up towards his superior

“It checks out, worthy for the next flight”

He simply states

<strong>Corpus guard 1</strong>
The other one nodded his heavy helmed head and turned his cyan visor towards the two Tenno

“Go on then, you know where the Catalogue room is so run before the good stuff is snagged”

<strong>Devros</strong>
He smiled and nodded his head, walking past the check point and motioning to Vuko to follow

“Tell Efus oi said &#39;owaya!”

He hollered over his shoulder as he briskly walked towards the door at the end of the hall

“Now…the rayle craic begins!”

He stated with a excited tone as he glanced towards the other boy</span>

The bushy haired tenno smirked as his comrades remark, believing himself that this truly will be a exciting outing. Honestly…nothing can top this feeling.

The boy lead the way down the hall, entering through it and leading Vuko towards the Y shaped corridor. He takes a left at the parting and approaches a grand door that has intricate patterns of iron flowers on it. It shimmers in a dim sapphire color, snakes of gold coiling around the rims and meeting at the middle, both hissing at each other. 

As Devros approached it triggered the sensors and the snakes parted the doors to reveal the Directory.</span>

The Directory of the Cobalt Needle Syndicate is a delicate thing, they have crates upon crates of rare and exotic goods, so if anyone hacks the list they can find out the location of such items onboard the Harlegand. To counter this they have built a room special just for that with it’s own central computer, managed by a unique Cephalon that is detached from the Weave. 

As the doors parted the duo will be presented in to a wide and very well lit circular room. The entirety of it’s walls are covered by screens, all projecting images and words in the Corpus language. They flicker with a bombardment of information that if Vuko is curious enough to read will range from item descriptions to pictures and at what time the item is going to be auctioned at. The information doesn’t linger too long on any of the screens as the words and pictures slowly travel to the bottom before it is replaced by another set of items and images from the top.

If you aim to make a full circle around the room then every 10 paces you will be greeted by smaller computer terminals with it’s screens waiting for input. They are mainly there for if anyone sees anything interesting from the main screens to look it up…or if they have a specific item to search for though key words.</span>

The digital animal consumes the entire tip of the pillar as if it absorbed it but at the same time appearing like a large painting accompanying the room with the slightest of twitches of it’s head indicating that is indeed “living” 

The digital animal simply looks at the arrivals as the doors open with it&#39;s dark orbed eyes but otherwise says nothing, continuing to silently sit on top of the branch, pressing it’s wings closer against it’s sides and only turning it’s head to gaze at the data dripping screens.</span>

The brutish looking boy smiles, his eyes hungrily scanning the screens, he nudges Vuko with a gentle jab of his elbow and motions with his chin to the right, where a table was set up containing a number of data pads

“Grab yerself wan av dohs an&#39; start &#39;eadin&#39; raun de room, scan de screens maybe yer fend somethin&#39; yer loike aye?” 

Devros walks over and takes one himself, it’s of simple design for mass production so it’s not very sturdy, but Vuko will find a search engine on it…all that is missing are key words that he might spot from the screens around the room or just stuff he might think the Syndicate might have in it’s vaults. Ask Cephalon Heimdall of how much the phrase “Primed pleasure rod” is searched…you’d be surprised of the result.

“Nigh wha is dat infesto?”

Devros hums as he turns around on his heels and looks about the room, trying to spot a tall Nidus…not a difficult task…right?</span>

“Dare yer man is, de mucker”

He huffed through his smile and started walking towards the fleshy colored blob.

“Oi! yer mangy fecker! yer ditched us aye? So rude!”

He hollered as he approached the Nidus with that wide friendly smile of his, aiming to land a playful punch to the others shoulder…or err…near it at least.</span>

    The bright, vivid colours blinded him at first. Then, as his eyes slowly adjusted, his pupils shrinking, they became beautiful. Ecstatic even. He could not look away. The colours overtaking each other like waves fighting on the surface of the ocean were just hypnotising.

    Devros tugging him by the sleeve had the effect of literally yanking Vuko out of a different reality, causing him to look around confused, like he had just woken up from a dream.</span>

The other Corpus was younger, and looked almost unrecognizable to literally every other Corpus- thanks to genetic preferences- but was distinguishable by his facial tattoos- most of them were curse words written in Corpus block letters.
Both of them wore some casual-formal Corpus wear, and were holding drinks not unlike the one in Kapak&#39;s hand, although the monstrous Nidus had a larger glass than the others.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;...and then I told her that it got really hard!!&quot; Kapak burst into laughter alongside the Corpus all of them giggling and trying to suppress their laughter by taking sips of their different beverages.
&quot;Oh, man, I never thought I&#39;d run into you guys here. Actually I didn&#39;t even know this was a thing! How long have you been coming to this thing, Halcyon?&quot;

<u>Halcyon:</u>
The old Corpus responded.
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not a common occurance, but I&#39;ve been coming to this little event here for years and years, whenever it opens. Or maybe it just feels like years and years. These old bones certainly feel that way.&quot;
Halcyon shifted his drink from his right hand into the other, slowing winding his arm and rolling his neck.

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;The arthritis acting up again, huh?&quot; Kapak inquired, sipping from his drink, &quot;It figures- synovectomies don&#39;t really offer a permanent solution, and I can&#39;t ever fully eliminate autoimmune disorders without... y&#39;know... innnnnnn....vesting people.&quot;
Kapak caught his words as some other wealthy looking Corpus strolled by, giving Kapak a dirty look.
&quot;TAKE A PICTURE! IT&#39;LL LAST LONGER!&quot; Kapak spat at them, stroking his moustache while he glared at the passers without even using any eyes of his own.

&quot;Oh, well I&#39;m with a new crew now, and one of the guys just mentioned it and it seemed interesting... in fact, there he is now! Hey, Devros!&quot;
Kapak waved his hands at Devros and Vuko, who was trailing behind him.
&quot;I didn&#39;t ditch y&#39;all, I just ran into these two muckers on the landing zone and hit the bar real quick. Anddddd from there we ended up here.&quot;
Kapak shrugged before wrapping an arm around each Corpus, knocking Cyrus in the head with his drink.
&quot;Cyrus, Halcyon, this is Devros and Vuko. Vuko and Devros, Cyrus and Halcyon.&quot;</span>

    After being almost literally dragged across the room towards Kapak and his friends, he stood still, watching their faces with an uncanny fascination as if they were all one big Jackson Pollock painting. His eyes jumping from the weird Nidus to one corpus, then to the other, only to jump back to the fleshy mutant.

    He continued to stare at the trio until he heard Kapak say his name, to which he responded with a small, startled jump. After the Nidus was done introducing everyone, Vuko extended his hand towards his torso, despite Kapak’s hands being wrapped around the corpus brothers.

    - “Hello, and I’m Vuko.” - He said while looking right into the mutated head, clearly not recognizing that it’s his friend behind the mustache. - “Do we know each other?”</span>

“Oy oy, Oi never tart dat stuff worked!

“It’s me you dunce,” Kapak hissed, momentarily lifting his hands away from the Corpus brothers and detaching the moustache from his face.
“I figured you’ve seen my disguises enough to recognize me with this one! ...although, this IS a new ‘stache. I guess I haven’t really used it before.”
The Corpus duo remained quiet but smiled and bowed their heads to Devros. Kapak continued.
“As a matter of fact I HAVE found something interesting. It isn’t quite a rare ancient artifact, but it is most interesting- Infested debris from some Corpus research base. It’s some kind of structural support, or maybe even a tool, covered in a low-aggression strain. The most intriguing aspect is that the Technocyte have appeared to form some kind of cocoon or chrysalis or pupa- like cyst on the end of it. If I can get my hands on it, I might be able to weaponize it!&quot;
Kapak crossed his arms.
&quot;And the best thing is- no one wants it! I placed a bid on it for only 5,000 credits, and no one&#39;s beaten me. Makes sense though- not many people would like to buy an Infested and, ah, likely illegal biohazard.&quot;</span>

    “Say whaaaaaaaa...” - He said, leaving his mouth wide open in awe, not believing that the freakishly tall, mustached Nidus was actually Kapak. While he was doing that, everyone could also notice that his pupils were unnaturally dilated.

    “ONWARD TO THE WIERD INFESTY-THING-MAGIG THEN!” - He shouted, letting the entire room know where he’s going, and started heading towards the nearest exit door, while pretending that he’s riding a horse by doing weird steps that resulted in his shoes clicking in the rhythm of a horse’s gait while his hands were holding imaginary reins.</span>

He shook his head at Kapak’s words 

“Yer weponise anythin&#39; yer touch &#39;uh?”

The shout from Vuko made the bushy haired man flinch and he quickly turned his head towards the air-horse-riding mofo that yelled out so close to his ear, ready to clap his ass. However, as his head turned he caught a glimpse in the corner of his eye, a shadow…no…not a shadow…a person? However, before he could fully focus his gaze towards the person it went away…within his next blink. Devros narrows his brows but eventually shrugs his shoulders…a trick of the light perhaps!

Turning fully towards Vuko, he reaches out and grabs the hopping cheer by the collar, attempting to fix him in place

“Whoat dare rider! Yer not evn’ gonna gie de directory a glance?”

This is weird indeed…but…he hasn’t known Vuko for that long to know what’s normal and what’s weird with him. Devros throws Kapak a glance as if saying <em>is this normal?</em>

---The large rainbow-bleeding owl turned his head to gaze at the one starting this commotion,, his feathers ruffling as he&#39;s obviously not pleased by the sudden outburst in the Directory---</span>

    He turns around on his imaginary horse, and does the same gallop routine, but this time with no shouting and with a hunched back, like he’s trying to gallop while sneaking. 

    Vuko comes uncomfortably close to Kapak’s face, and mirroring him with the whispering he says - “What? Me? Neeeeever. You know too good a boy for such wild and nasty things.” - he mocks the idea in a voice that makes it clear the opposite is true. - “And I don’t know what you are talking about. I just grabbed some chocolate deliciousness from the kitchen...” - He finishes up the sentence with a weird, and much exaggerated wink.

    Before the Nidus had time to respond, Vuko looked past him, and with a “Ooooh! Shiny!” maneuvered around him to the nearest directory terminal.</span>

Feeling more at ease, his hand drops from his face and he straightens up, his playful sandy orbs twirling towards Vuko as he hopped towards one of the consoles. He looks up at Kapak and points towards the runaway vagabond

The bushy haired man let out a chuckle at the brothers antics, despite still feeling a splinter of unease about the brownie situation. It won’t happen right? Yeah yeah! Even if Garhul isn’t here, he’s confidant it will stay as it is.

He lifts his glassed eyes towards the two brothers and waves his hand in the air in a dismissive manner

“Not nade for that…”

He paused his waving as a through just hit him. The expression on the boy changes from friendly to excited.

“Actually…you two might actually &#39;elp me oyt!”

He boasted, almost sending a echo around the screen-lit room. Hopping on his heels, he sprungs around and darts towards the nearest terminal which was a couple of paces away, up against the large wall sized screens. He turns around towards the two brothers, coaxing them to come towards him.</span>

He types in a few commands on the available list that is bleeding on all of the screens, and out a image of a Cephalon pops up as one of the listed items. The Cephalon is depicted as a purple feather with one single white strand poking up from the base. The two Corpus can read on the screen, if they wished so, that the Cephalon is named Q’ara as well as a short description of the item that went:

Devros looks towards the duo, pointing towards the screen with a nudge of his chin

“Can yer fellas &#39;elp oyt an&#39; put down a offer for dat? Chucker not, Oi’ll pay it oyt wi&#39; me credits oi just…

He paused looking to the side, as if searching for someone, before returning his gaze back at the brothers

“…don’t want me name ter be up there…personal reasons yer nu.”

He chuckled, nervously, hoping the duo would understand. 

---The screen in front of Vuko lit up with a flash as a window popped up saying “Do you wish to set a offer?” for the item he was viewing---</span>

Back where Devros was, the Corpus brothers leaned over to look at the Cephalon&#39;s page.
&quot;Oh, my! An older model of Cephalon, quite high class indeed. Well, me and my brother DO have quite deep pockets, so...&quot;

Hearing Kapak scream not to do it, there was only one possible outcome. With a big, dumb smile painted across his face Vuko was about to press the button just mere milliseconds before the Nidus yanked his hand away, ending in him hitting a random part of the screen. 

As he was being quite literally dragged away from the terminal, he decided halfway through that the best way to go about things is to go limp. 

And so he did. Just as his body hit the ground with a <em>thump</em> and laid down on the ground, Vuko attempted to escape his friends clutches by rolling on the ground sideways, somehow thinking that it’ll make him unnoticeable.</span>

The boy smiled and nodded at the two brothers

“Tanks lads, oi owe yer wan!”

He chuckled and looked over his shoulder to see the situation with Kapak and Vuko…which wasn’t a great one to boot. He tilts his head and looks back at the Corpus

“Alright let’s uh…get one with some sight seeing huh?”

He pushes himself off the console and started briskly walking towards Kapak, to try and give a hand <u><strong>”You cannot help”</strong></u> A voice ringed through his head and he froze mid step, his eyes narrowing. It’s been a long time since he’s heard <em>his</em> voice…this is not good… Garhul is not here to fix it! He felt panic rising from deep within him, cold sweat dripping down his forehead. <u><strong>”You cannot help”</strong></u> He heard it repeating again  and he clenched his teeth, his hands coiling in to fists <em>”Go away</em>” He growled from under his breath. Whatever he ate, whatever Vuko gave him…was spoiled!

He started walking, stomping towards Kapak and Vuko, stopping just a few paces from them and from the limp boy.

“Can we move on?”

He huffed from under his nose, his voice sounding more irritated than from his usual cheerful self, the smell of unease oozing from him. His golden eyes dropping to gaze at Vuko</span>

Kapak followed after Vuko&#39;s rolling torso at walking pace, his massive stride allowing him to keep pace with the Tenno.
&quot;Move aside people! Move please, thank you!&quot;
Kapak yelled and waved his arms to move bystanders out of the path of the &#39;furiously&#39; rolling Tenno.

<u>Cyrus:</u>
&quot;Is he usually like that?&quot; Cyrus turned to Devros as the group casually followed Vuko.

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;We can move on as soon as Vuko&#39;s back under control- yagh!&quot;
Kapak extended his palm, and like a dart, out shot a slimy tendril with a needle-like tip. It penetrated Vuko&#39;s side and was enough to stop him from rolling. A quick injection of morphine from the tendril would also ensure a painless prick, although it was likely Vuko was already high enough to not even feel it.
Kapak stood Vuko up forcefully and gripped him by the shoulders.
&quot;Now, I&#39;m gonna soak up all that junk that&#39;s flowing through your veins and you&#39;re gonna stand by me while I do. Then we&#39;re going to continue on our nice little trip with no problems, y&#39;hear me?&quot;</span>

Once on his feet, the Tenno was looking right at the Nidus’ head as he was explaining something that was clearly going over his head.  He was just nodding along, pretending to know exactly what he means. “Yes daddy.” He finished up once his friend stopped speaking, a daft smile on his face.</span>

The flat faced boy turned to look at one of the Corpus, providing a simple shrug of his shoulders as a opening answer to his question

“If he is den i’d invite &#39;imself more frequently ter me grub parties.”

A shadow of a smirk can be seen spreading across his lips, but the joke itself didn’t feel as hearty as it should have been, his mind fighting on two fronts.

Noticing that the Nidus got it under control, he quickly cast a glance at the perched digital owl sitting atop the middle of the room – only to be greeted by two unblinking obsidian gems staring at him. <em>”YIKES</em>” He invardly jumps at their intensity and quickly turns around

“Gran&#39; so let’s uhhh….scurry along fast. We can catch wan av de aucshuns.”

He starts briskly walking towards the only door in the room, which they entered through. &quot;<u><strong>You cannot run</strong></u> &quot;He hears it again but choses to ignore it, getting through this shit and going back to Garhul is priority one right now!</span>

Kapak wrapped his fleshy claw over Vuko&#39;s shoulder, guiding the Tenno towards the door that Devros was headed for. Hopefully he would be a little more grounded now that Kapak had started filtering his blood.
&quot;After you, Devros! Everything should be much better now that we have this guy under control. Um, sorry Mr. Owl!&quot; Kapak waved apologetically at the cephalon&#39;s holographic form before hurrying to catch up with Devros.

The boy leads the group out of the Directory and back at the corridor which they used before. This time, however he takes a left turn, down the intricate designed hallway that looked to be fit more for a royal castle than a auction ship.
