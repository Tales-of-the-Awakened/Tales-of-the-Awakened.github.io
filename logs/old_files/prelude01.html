 was as indifferent as it always was. Hushed, silent and calm. But the 
relative calmness of the Solar system was soon disturbed, and for a few 
days tossed into disarray. Why? What could cause such a thing? A 
singular message coming from seemingly everywhere around the system, 
breaking Corpus and Grineer Satellites after the message was delivered 
through them. Message, that was meant for no one in particular, but at 
the same time aimed at the the only group that could find meaning in it,
 if ever there was one. ~<br><br>"<b>THE WOMB OF THE SKY IS LAID BARE.

 and Corpus, whos satellites were destroyed got only gibberish. And not 
every Tenno got to hear the message. But that was too little of a 
hindrance for the birth of a new tale.~

                            ~Grineer, Corpus, Infested, Tenno. All 
entangled in a constant scramble across the solar system. Always going 
somewhere. Incredible distances are crossed in the blink of an eye and a
 flash in the dark. All just to hurry off to another ball of dust, 
another mine of gold, another river of blood. Seldom is the space they 
zip through paid a passing thought, yet that chasm of void yawns twelve 
billion kilometers across and extends even further. Many things are lost
 to its boundless depths. One such thing happened to be a beacon of 
Corpus dreams. Dreams that were left exiled to the emptiness of the 
unknown in hopes that it would swallow their mistakes. Now, a single 
figure keeps the grounds. A Tenno, who built a new front atop the dusty 
skeletons.~<br><br><b>???:</b><br>Inside a peculiar and long since 
abandoned Corpus station, a warframe frantically paced back and forth. 
The room he stalked featured a series of monitors and levers, switches 
and buttons. Its darkness, lit by the fluorescence of an Orokin Reactor 
Core and filled with its hum. The warframe was of Limbo design, bearing 
clashing colours of yellow and black. He donned a deep-black cloak which
 flashed a solid merigold from its interior. He wore his hood up despite
 having no reason to do so, it just seemed to help him focus sometimes, 
especially when he was tired. He moved back and forth among the controls
 and view-screens adjusting dials and listening to frequencies. It had 
been a while since he’d scoured the system in this manner. His cephalon 
usually handled the brute force, but sometimes the Limbo found he could 
hear peculiar things others could not. It was quite… strange. <br><br>A 
song drifted to his ears through his communicator. It was a serene 
melody, featuring a sole soprano feeding emotion to the listener. It was
 a song no one had ever heard: created on a whim for only one set of 
ears. It cascaded over his soul, stroking it with peace and calmness.

                            <br><b>?????:</b><br>“♪Sle-ep on qui-et wa--ters~♪”<br><br><b>???:</b><br>The
 warframe froze, hand gripping the dial it had been rotating. He was 
overcome by a feeling of off-balance, as if the core of his being was 
tilted. He needed to correct it. There was something there. Turn back 
three.<br><br><div class="pre pre--multilineDis">Tυɾɳ Ⴆαƈƙ ƚԋɾҽҽ.<br></div><br>He
 cranked the dial back three places, letting the click of each movement 
bounce across the empty walls. Just as the third click fell into place, 
the Tenno was greeted by what sounded shockingly similar to the 
bone-chilling voice of his kind’s old enemies. His heart dropped into 
his gut. On the finishing line, the station he had been standing in 
shook. Various lights, including the reactor core behind him, dimmed and
 flickered momentarily.<br><br>“XerAI, I’ve found it,” he announced in a raspy voice.<br><br><b><s>?????</s> XerAI:</b><br>The
 symphony faded away, yet the singer remained. Instead of issuing 
sonorous chords it spoke directly to the Limbo, retaining the softness 
in its tone. “Who should I get then ⌒‿⌒?”<br><br><b>???:</b><br>“The quickest fool like me, my dear cephalon.”<br><br><b>XerAI:</b><br>“And what should I tell them ・/・?”<br><br><b>???:</b><br>“Just
 give them my name again. Just give them Disruptis.” The Limbo cranked a
 few more machines to life and tried to trace the cryptic clue.

twelve different satellites, all of different nature - some of them 
belonged to corpus, others to the Grineer...and all were hopelessly 
broken, straight after the message played out through them. The message 
itself contained the virus aimed to break any Corpus or Grineer 
equipment containing it after it was played one single time. Tracing the
 signal back to messenger was not an option. The location of those 
satellites though... was more than peculiar, as if all the satellites 
were deliberately placed in twelve places around the system... by 
someone or something.~

faceless frown. He walked over to the massive monitor at the center of 
the room, his movements lethargic from a lack of rest. On it was 
displayed a map of the Origin system with an overwhelming amount of 
information and numbers. The Tenno swiped his finger on an option from 
an index in the top right, filtering all the blips and nodes down to 
thousands of satellites. He may lack skills in many areas like fighting 
and biology, but software engineering was one of his incredible 
strengths. He had manufactured quite an impressive bug over the decades 
that served as a simple reconnaissance virus; it didn’t do anything 
fancier than relaying spec information and location to its host. The 
program spread itself as inconspicuously as possible through any network
 and machine it was capable of getting into. As a result, Disruptis had 
gathered a rather extensive inventory of Grineer, Corpus, and even some 
Tenno and Faction satellites. He was probably missing a lot of secret 
and particularly juicy ones, but it was enough for most occasions. He 
brought up the new connections and investigated their positions and 
whether or not they were catalogued in his database, hoping to bring up 
some useful information on the satellites’ origins and their 
manufacturers.<br><br><b>XerAI:</b><br>The music stayed its hiatus and 
resumed again, but at a quicker pace with a composition that sparked 
curiosity and adventure. XerAI’s operator wasn’t dependent on the 
symphonies, they merely tended to improve his mood a little while he was
 alone.

disappeared from radar at some point in time and then reappeared in the 
places they now occupy.<br>Nine satellites were placed at equal distance
 from the Sun on the outskirts of the system,with other three - placed 
closer to the center. By some coincidence all three were placed near 
small Orokin outposts in asteroids, each containing a Void gate. Those 
locations were places of constant conflict between Tenno and other 
factions, since those points were used to access Orokin Towers with 
Torsion Beam devices.~

 had garnered far too much experience in dealing with unknown entities

Corpus AI imitating cephalons pretty well in the past however, so he 
tucked that idea in the back of his mind for now. The Tenno formulated 
his response and glanced to the corner of his dimly lit room.<br><br>There,
 silent as a tree tossing gently in the wind, sat a bird in a cage. The 
portable cell was forged out of rubedo, its sparkling coat catching the 
stray rays of the reactor’s light to faintly shimmer in the darkness. 
The bird itself was a peculiar one: a small, endangered species 
belonging to the near-extinct Psittaculidae family. Its green feathers 
ruffled but made no extra movement. Disruptis observed it, frozen for a 
couple minutes. Nothing.<br><br>The Limbo revisited the terminal. <i>Please let this be a transmission, I don’t want to have to deal with o’twelve screaming again!</i>
 he begged in his mind. The Tenno wasn’t that confident his pleas would 
come to fruition, for no camera had been installed on the consoles 
anywhere despite the mysterious being clearly stating his warframe’s 
appearance. <i>Muck,</i> he cursed.<br><br>“Don’t worry, I’m here,” Disruptis announced, carefully selecting his words.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis gave a light 
chuckle as Elo pretended to stick his imaginary tongue out. From the 
cephalon’s response to his baited question, he deduced a few things. <i>So
 it looks like this guy knows a good amount on current events, enough to
 know that the Grineer and Corpus are factions who have stationed 
multiple satellites; I’m willing to bet he knows a lot more about what’s
 going on in the system too. Yet I’m still apparently the ‘first 
friendly voice in forever’ to talk to the him. It’s a good thing he 
cared about getting my name though, things that don’t set off a lot of 
red flags. How long was he broadcasting for? He also seemed to see 
through my lie about owning the satellites.</i><br><br>Feeling safe 
enough to open up more, Disruptis readdressed Elo. “Sorry, the last time
 I was randomly contacted by a cephalon like you, he tried to feed me to
 his dog,” he mused, “But the name’s Disruptis. Don’t bother asking for a
 last name though because I don’t have one.”<br><br>The Limbo tried to locate the positions of the satellites once again. “So what exactly <i>is</i> your message for?”

 sound, yet seemed to mimic a pattern of… laughing.~<br><br><b>Disruptis:</b><br>The
 Limbo felt the hairs on his physical body stand up from all the way in 
his transference chair back on his orbiter. After all this time, ‘012

spontaneously collapse, crushing his frame in a matter of seconds. And 
that'd be simply because it felt like doing so.<br><br>Disruptis 
silently crept up to the open door on the other side of the room and 
carefully closed it. It was the only way in or out. The Limbo shook his 
head and slapped his face with his hands, attempting to forcefully fling
 his premonitions away. “Hold on a second,” he spoke slowly and softly, 
“what made you ask a mere stranger for help? What went wrong with your 
lair?”

the ability to communicate with me in a location that makes this entire 
conversation preposterous, and you can’t reach out enough to scratch 
your own back?”<br><br>He leaned over the terminal window, supporting 
his weight using both of his forearms. He brought his helmet close the 
the terminal window and looked upwards off in to the distance. A brief 
moment passed as he lost himself in thought. “What is this ‘Spire’ for? 
If it does exist, why has no one contacted it in years? What was it 
hidden away for? Was it so that something couldn’t get in or... so that 
something wouldn’t be let out?” He slowly brought his gaze down to stare
 at the map once again. “Who… are you?”

Spire...It ...was...and is at its core an Anti-Sentient operation. It 
was started long before Tenno were even a thing. The brightest minds of

 Everything that your average Orokin never knew existed. All hidden away
 in Tower that is covered by the thickest layer of solar radiation . 
That makes any ability to find it from the outside obsolete. "<br>He chuckled a bit, reminiscing.<br>“The
 only way Sentients could find us is if they literally hit their head on
 the hull. Even communication was impossible. Until one of our geniuses 
found the way around that. Since then we were working through the Weave,
 distributing protection patches to the Cephalons of different ships, in
 secret, obviously. We made it harder for Sentients to hack them."<br>His tone changed a little bit as he regained part of his composure. <br>"But
 in the eyes of the Head of Research, protection was never enough. So, 
in the end we resorted to something we never knew we could resort to. 
Inability of the outside world to communicate with us finally proven 
useful."<br>A small pause occurred.And then his composure was gone as quickly as it appeared.<br>"The
 rest of the information is classified. Im literally blocked off from 
telling you what exactly we did...Sorry.I believe that once you reached

say that not everything is lost,that i could try again but… while i was 
talking to you, the first one. I contacted another... five to twelve 
Tenno. They either didn't picked up the phone or dropped it in the 
middle of the conversation. Maybe some of them continued their pursuit 
on their own... Maybe they thought it was a hoax...Or maybe they went to
 deliver the message to their superiors - Lotus,some syndicates, 
whatever. You are the only one at this moment who knows more then most….
 I guess,i could resort to another hundred years of simply observing the
 decay and death of everyone i ever knew… Maybe by the time that 
everyone eventually dies, the Sun will consume that cursed tower...and 
myself with it.”

for a moment, taking in the cephalon’s story as the atmosphere hung, 
stirred by nothing but the gentle hum of the reactor behind him. An 
Anti-sentient operation would be revolutionary given the pressing times,
 if it indeed had succeeded. The information on the sentients was no 
small treasure to boot. Those were some clear game-changers, worth the 
risk of being tricked. However, the Tenno’s mind was more occupied with 
other thoughts. The truth was, Disruptis was one of the biggest suckers 
in the system for helping hurting people. He empathized almost anyone 
greatly, and burned with an intense desire for a universe where people 
just... cared for each other. Unfortunately, reality is harsh. The Limbo
 had observed a galaxy where the corrupted seemed to outweigh the pure, 
almost as if all sentient lifeforms were genetically designed to destroy
 each other in their own greed. Anyone could agree that it was a little 
unfair to look at <i>everyone</i> that way, even <i>most</i> people, but
 recent events had clouded his worldview. His own carelessness and 
naivety had turned some of his actions for the worse, causing his flame 
for a better society to slowly fade into dying embers.<br><br><i>Yet here I am,</i> the Limbo reflected somberly, <i>becoming
 exactly what I tried to change. Right when it may matter most… Does it 
even matter if I’m being tricked? What happened to my smile?</i> He 
chuckled softly, reminiscing on some old and treasured memories with 
cherished people. A voice floated up to his attention as he sifted 
through the recollections. <br><span class="pre pre--inline">“...your...invincible grin!”</span><br><br>Disruptis
 shook his head quickly, then responded with a renewed sense of vigor. 
“Right, well Elo. Let me be the first one to tell you that you must be 
the luckiest farthermucker on this side of the Void, ‘cause you’ve 
walked into exactly the right place. The slash-RU Corporation 
first-response team is here for immediate deployment! How can we help?”

<br>His voice was filled with disbelief and happiness, as if a million stones just got off his chest.
<br>"Really?!You gonna do it?! You gonna help me?! ...Oh....What a 
relief...Thank you!Thank you, thank you, thank you,thank youu!!! You are
 not going to regret this! That's a promise!"
<br>
<br>His tone quickly switched back to busy, as he yet again started to explain things.
<br>"Right. Back to the mission at hand. Those satellites that you're 
found. The ones that are currently being destroyed, dismantled and blown
 up. Three of those satellites were deliberately placed by me near the 
Orokin ruins, close to the center of the system. Two were placed near 
the ruins that were already pillaged. <b>Gutted and picked apart</b>"
<br>
<br>That set of words was seemingly accompanied by the glitch, that 
caused part of the message to replay. Whatever it was, Elo never 
acknowledged it, continuing his explanation as if nothing happened.
<br>"But One, one contains a functioning Void Gate. I could open it from
 my side for you to enter. Here it is, im sending you the nav-point as 
we speak."
<br>~And the nav-point arrived, pointing to the cluster of large 
asteroids between Venus and Earth. Upon the closer inspection,  a small 
Orokin space station, seemingly built in one of the asteroids could be 
noticed.~
<br>
<br><b>Elo:</b>
<br>"Once you get in, I will guide you personally. So don't you worry, 
Disruptis, you gonna be in good hands. Nonphysical, but still good."

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>When Disruptis heard 
the ominous, low-pitched echo of dialogue, he immediately spun around. 
It sounded to him like something that had come from the station, and 
only served to spook him even more than he presently was. The Limbo 
tried to shake off the feeling of anxiety once again, with partial 
success.<br><br>Hearing the rest of the instructions, he rubbed his 
hands together vigorously. Exploring the far reaches of the Origin 
system was his favourite past-time, and is something he’s dedicated more
 work into than anything else. Hearing about a secret little Orokin 
station floating on the back of an asteroid he had never heard of before
 got him even more enticed. With a flick of his finger upon the screen’s
 surface, he pulled up his travel history. Nothing indicated that he had
 been to the cluster before, confirming his lack of knowledge. With a 
few more taps, he marked the locations of the other two for later 
expedition.<br><br>“Alright that’s good. I’ll get over there as soon as 
possible,” Disruptis responded. He opened the connection to his own 
cephalon since he already deemed the situation to be safe. “Hey XerAI, 
I’ve found you a new friend, can you get my craft ready?” The Limbo 
synced his work with his own databases and left open a channel for 
communication with Elo, then left the room, navigating the haunted halls
 to their entrance.<br><br><b>XerAI:</b><br>With a hum, XerAI voice slided into the transmissions once again. “Oh? (ﾟρﾟ) And who might you be? ◠‿◠” she inquired.

<br>"You better. After my message, who knows what might try to vacate the station."
<br>
<br>At first he was looking forward to start new conversation. But 
then...few worrisome signs showed up. The answer to XerAI's question 
went out of the airlock as Elo informed Disruptis about his findings.
<br>"Well now, that is interesting. Either I'm experiencing some sort of
 memory loss or... your cephalon wasn't patched. At least i don't 
register it. And name does not check out. None of the Charred Spire's 
personnel ever patched your Cephalon! Very strange. And extremely 
dangerous. If she doesn't have any patches - it would be a walk in a 
park for Sentient to hack her. And that has consequences as you can 
imagine. Various. None are good."

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>The Limbo paused for a 
second. “That is true, I’ll give you that,” he commented. There was a 
little more to his own cephalon than one might think, as it was a 
particularly needlessly complex mechanism. The implementation of such a 
design probably wouldn’t be the easiest thing to accomplish, but 
definitely very important. Disruptis jogged through the corridors at a 
brisk pace until he heard the pitter patter of dropping water. He came 
out into a large, darkened room with a high, vaulted ceiling. 
Precipitation inexplicably formed at the top and released down in large 
droplets, creating a constant cascade of rain. The Tenno didn’t bother 
reaffirming his observations on the rest of the room and dashed out the 
long bridge to the exit where his landing craft was already waiting. He 
wasted no time hopping in and blasting away to his orbiter.<br><br><b>XerAI:</b><br>“Hm, so there’s something wrong? Unusual? Is it better if I don’t participate in the next mission then? •﹏•”

 back into the game...i wouldn't count on it."
<br>There was little mystery about what or whom he was talking about. 
Hunhow was somewhere out there... But it was yet to be seen if he's 
going to play any part in the things that were going to happen.
<br>"That's why we need to do things fast. The longer we tarry - more 
time Sentients have to narrow down their search. But once Disrupts

<br>The chuckle that followed was nothing but sinister.

                            ~A couple hours passed as Disruptis 
travelled to the asteroid belt indicated by Elo. As his cloaked orbiter 
approached he ran a scan over the marked hunk of space rock, searching 
for the location of the fable Orokin ruins on its surface and checking 
its state of repair and accessibility.~<br><br><b>Disruptis:</b><br>“Well here we are, a ball of dust worth thousands of platinum. We are here, right Elo?” Disruptis said.

<br>~The asteroid field was thick and hard to maneuver trough, as if it 
was one big asteroid, slowly falling apart. From the outside of it, the 
remains of the Corpus satellite could be seen, surrounded by three small
 Grineer ships.~
<br>"I don't register any Sentients...only the Grineer... which are easy to lure away. Time to work my magic."
<br>He made sound as if clearing his throat and then went silent.
<br>
<br>Suddenly, a transmission went trough the landing craft's scanner. It sounded like...grineer? 
<br><b>"Unit Sevenk-Tok-Che-Shux, new orders for you. Our scanners

<br><b>"Acknowledged, Control. Come on brothers, lets get out of here."</b>

<br>~The Orokin  ruin wasn't build on top of the asteroid but it looked 
like the asteroid was growing on it. And now was in the process of 
crumbling. Like the Moon, it was slowly revealing what was inside.The 
only entrance revealed itself after the landing craft approached the 
asteroid. The golden door, big enough to let the landing craft into a 
small hangar, opened.

all big oafs.” <br><br>The inside of the Limbo’s orbiter was scattered 
with consoles and wires not typically found on typical models of the 
craft. He had installed numerous additions into the ship’s systems, 
mostly to do with experimenting in his own learning of the digital 
world, yet some of his creations had sprouted more practical fruits. He 
pressed a button to turn off the ship’s thrusters, flipped a couple 
switches to disengage its engine, and punched a button to begin the 
deployment of its landing craft. “Xerie, I’m taking you with me.”<br><br><b>XerAI:</b><br>“As always. ⁽ˇ́˙ˇ̀˵⁾ ”<br><br><b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis
 walked up the ramp of his orbiter and retrieved a small, but sturdy 
cage off the nearby desk. A flash of green feathers escaped from the 
within confines of its rubedo constraints as it housed the bird inside. 
The Tenno hooked it onto the waist of his warframe. Meanwhile, his 
cephalon detached his landing craft and charted its route to the 
surface. As Disruptis got closer to the ruins, he drank in the sight of 
such an ancient relic. An adventurer such as himself lived and died for 
such moments, and the euphoria never got old. A private waterfall, a 
secret grove, a forgotten people, all motivations for the passionate 
drive of any explorer. Orokin splendor was especially an incredible 
find. Eventually, Disruptis’s vessel made its way into the hangar and 
touched down with a hiss and a clunk. “Alright Elo, where to from here?”
 he inquired in transmission, taking in his immediate surroundings.

of machines c ame from seemingly everywhere, while the platform on which
 the landing craft was place, began its descend.  That is when the 
meaning of the word "Gateway" was revealed. The Void-Gate was directly 
under the landing platform. As the realization of that seeped into mind 
of Tenno- the connection with Elohim was cut. The starry, golden energy 
of the Void enveloped the platform and the ship for a few seconds, and 
as easily as it consumed the craft, it let it go. Leaving it in the much
 larger hangar full of different small spacecrafts of Orokin nature. 
Most of them looked like transport ships, while some looked like they 
were build for war. The hangar itself was in pristine condition as if it
 was cleaned regularly. The lights in the hangar were dim, as if the 
place was on low power,but still there was a lot of sights to take in.~

 His craft whirred and clicked as it disengaged its ramp’s locking

 Limbo slammed a final button with his fist and the ramp opened up with a
 smooth hiss. He excitedly hurried down it and into the massive hangar.

<br>"Woahwoahwoah there! What's the hustle all of the sudden? This

relax do some breathing exercises...take it in. Welcome to the Charred

<br>"If you are excited - i kinda get that. First impression of pristine
 Orokin everything...Nothing like any Tenno seen before. Actually, come 
to think of it - You are the first one to ever visit the Charred Spire! 
Congratulations!"
<br>He flown a little bit away from the landing craft, signaling Disrputis to follow him .
<br>"But you have to admit, i did a great job keeping it as it is." the 
drone looked around itself while floating trough the Hangar to the exit,
 passing by Orokin vessels. "For what...two?One? Three! Three hundred 
years! Boy do i deserve a pat on the back for that. I'm surprised i 
didnt went bonkers...hehe..."the colour of the drone's lights changed to
 red, and it slowly turnd its "eye" to Disruptis, slightly shaking.And 
talking with creepy voice.
<br>"<b>Or maybe i did? HehehhAHAHAHAHA</b>"
<br>But it was over as quickly as it started, the drone turned blue again.

finished talking, the Limbo continued forward again without responding, 
but at a less frantic pace. He briskly walked towards one of the orokin 
vessels, his head tilting further and further backwards to keep it in 
full view as he approached. Upon arrival, Disruptis slid a hand across 
the surface of the craft slowly, then picked up his hand at the end of 
his wipe and inspected it for dust. To which he found none.<br><br>“I 
remember these models, they were used in the Great War!” Disruptis 
commented in wonder, “Each one was either blown to fragments or lost to 
the Void.” He put his head next to the hull, as if trying to listen for 
signs of life. “Haha! I don’t suppose you’d be willing to let me take 
one out for a spin when we’re done?”

lighting occured. Next hall was bright, multiple golden plates 
reflecting the light, which was emitted from several walls of 
transparent glass high under the roof. The hall was big, pure example of
 Orokin love for decorations. It was branching out - doors big and small
 leading to the multitude of the unknown chambers, containing secrets of
 the age long gone. <br>Two golden statues of creatures, resembling 
giant cats of the past, guarded a middle-sized door atop the stairway. 
The door was standing out from all others, as if leading to the place 
most sacred. Whole ensemble left a certain feeling… like whoever was 
standing in this place was not in a simple highly-decorated hall...but 
in some sort of chappel. A Temple. The drone flies directly to that 
door, leaving Disruptis to either follow him or look around, if he so

around, taking in the view of it all. Even XerAI let out a whistle over

 again?” he inquired with a gesture of air quotes. As he talked, the

<br>"The Core is the Center of the Spire. Most of the Towers's systems 
converge there. My datascape is currently there, the Reactor too, and a 
few research facilities. Once we are there, you will have to submit your
 blood sample so i could record your DNA into the ledger of "Outside 
Contractors". This way, most of the Spire's systems will be open to you 
for examination and interaction. Then as an Outside Contractor, you will
 authorize the restart of the Spire. Once the restart is complete, I 
hope all of the Tower's systems will be back in my control. There is 
always a possibility that it wouldn't work...but...i get a hunch...a

<br>"This? This is what we call the Central Elevator. From here - 
multiple elevators lead to different ends of the tower. The transition 
point, so to speak. Though most of them locked right now. I switched the

that were still working and under my control, to the Cryogenic array and
 other facilities that need more attention than others."

 we? Where in the system is the Spire hidden so well that it hasn’t been
 found by anyone for centuries? From the message, I gathered that it was
 in the ‘Sun’s bloated shadow’, but where exactly is that to you?” 
Disruptis rattled off with questions. At the same time, he retrieved a 
gammacor from his hip that bore additional spikes on the back of each 
prong embedded with miniscule LEDs. He locked his tri-capsule battery in
 place on his forearm, then twisted the back-most container. <i>Click</i>. He removed the segment and placed it inside his hip, switching it with one of a different colour.

that. <i>I bet it actually is just close to the Sun, although if it were

do say so myself,” Disruptis declared in exuberance, bringing his right

 he stepped into the elevator.

<br>He addressed the cephalon privately, as if knowing what she did: 
"XerAI, please stop ruining my fun? I like to keep him guessing, you 
know? First visitor in three hundred years. I need to get my kicks, you 
smarty-pants. I know its in your nature  to help your Operator. That was
 what you were created to do... But common...Spare me a couple of laughs
 at the cost of him scratching his head.Please?"
<br>
<br>He seemed to ignore words that Disruptis said, coming to his own 
conclusions about the man he was going to work with for a long time. He 
knew that they will get along quite nicely.
<br>When they were in the elevator, the doors closed and it started 
moving, almost unnoticeably. After a twenty seconds the drone, that was 
just floating in the air, visibly shuddered.
<br>"Oh...this is not good. Not good, not good. I thought i disabled it!"
<br>Elo's voice was frantic, nervous...panicked even. Something went 
wrong, and Disruptis found out what not long after. He talked with 
pauses between words as if it took a long time to process every word
<br>"Something or someone....turned on the defense systems...The 
Sentinels...they are up and working... Who...Who else is in the Tower, 
besides us?...That...that is impossible. The cryogenic array is online, 
everyone is sleeping...but...Something... changes the system around me. 
it's like... they...take... my hands...and do....ARGHHHH... I DONT EVEN 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THINGS ANYMORE!!!"
<br>
<br>Elo sounded like he was loosing it. A child, dropped into a pit from
 which he couldn't get out. His voice, his words were glitching, 
changing...failing to convey the intended message. 
<br>"Disruptis, i don't know what is going on but we have to hurry. 
Seems like the Spire doesn't take lightly to trespassers...even though I
 AM THE MASTER OF THE SPIRE, I SHOULD ANSWER FOR THE DESFENSS SYSTEM  
BUT YET I AM NOT!"
<br>
<br>~The elevator seemed to go fast. Faster then before, that's for 
sure. The Core loomed closer. They will be there before too long.~

 continued to grin inwardly as they begun to move. However, his moments 
of reveling in his own humour were cut short when Elo started panicking.
 Upon grasping the situation, he felt a sinking feeling settle into the 
bottom of his stomach. The Tenno's instincts kicked in. He quickly 
snapped his fingers and was instantly enveloped in purple energy as the 
veil of the rift descended upon his frame.<br><br>“Ey, ey, ey! What’s

<br>He answered in the concentrated manner, trying to fit as much words in the seconds that they had.
<br>"Im speeding up the transportation while simultaneously locking the 
Core off, before Sentinels have a chance to amass any respectable force 
in there. Kinda breaking safety protocols but who gives a byte? The 
probability of me losing control over the Spire just sky-rocketed, and 
I'm not gonna simply keel over and surrender myself to that! Many people
 will probably die if I will not be there to watch over them." 
<br>
<br>The elevator stopped sharply and opened its doors to the  small 
metallic corridor. The lights were dim and red, clearly the whole place 
was on power saving mode. The door on the opposite side of the corridor 
was locked, preventing further entry.The drone flied directly to it, and
 started interfacing with the panel near it.
<br>"I am not detecting any outside influences, which could only mean 
one thing. The intervention comes from within, from one of the Spire's 
systems... The "who" and "how" will have to wait, but it seems that the 
thing we are going to do is at the same time the reason and a cure. If a
 Spire-wide reset is launched,  I will be able to start up the systems 
one after another and check them for corruption, and subsequently clear 
it out."

open, Disruptis reached for the candy-apple red synoid gammacor resting 
at his hip. When he tapped it the device instantly snapped to his arm, 
anchoring itself via electromagnetic waves. The Limbo ran his fingers 
over the three cylinders now attached to his upper arm, mentally 
double-checking that he had installed the hardware and software 
interfacers. While the little drone frantically worked away at the 
console, Disruptis silently stepped up to the door and performed an 
extremely basic systems scan to get an idea of how the mechanism's 
circuits were wired. Beams of flickering green light projected out the 
front of his gammacor in different shapes and sizes onto the doorway.<br><br>“So should I be preparing to grind some fools into scrap metal on the other side of this door?” Disruptis asked as he worked.

<br>"Possibly. Don't know. As I've said, Sentinels were taken out of my 
control and any tracking hardware that was installed in them - I cannot 
see anymore. But Sentinels are the least of our concerns even if they 
are same height as you and physically might be on your frame's level. 
Rift is good in that case. But the commotion might cause the Warden to 
wake up. And he...well, he is hard case. Very hard. Might kill your 
warframe even from the Rift. Or might help out. As I've said - hard 
case."
<br>
<br>~The scan revealed something...Strange. Most of the mechanisms 
around the door and beyond...were pulsing with energy. Constantly. 
Looked more like veins than standard wiring. As if what was hidden 
behind the metal and bone plating was truly alive.~
<br>
<br><b>Elo:</b>
<br>He was a little irritated by the scans, but mostly by situation in 
general. From the side - it was quite understandable. Elo hoped for and 
easy mission, but the closer they were to the end - the more hard it was
 to reach. Who wouldn't be pissed at that?
<br>"You can look at the insides later, once the crisis is averted.  
Trough my cameras I register at least two Sentinels, behind that door. 
They are waiting for you. Remember, they are not what you think they 
are. You can try to outrun them. But if you're not going to - aim for 
the joints, their armor is to hard for basic weaponry. You'll see what 
im talking about in a second, just let me finish with this. Prepare your
 weapons while I'm  ensuring that no one else jumps one us. No one goes 
anywhere if i have anything to say about that, you metalheads!"

lighted as the one they left. The hall seemed to be entrance area, with a
 large fountain in the middle. On the right - the walls with glass 
windows and the door, leading to the side-room with unknown purpose. 
Opposite of Disruptis, at the end of the hall - another bigger door 
leading to somewhere major. On the left - several benches and the 
miniature garden, hidden in a glass terrarium. But all that was an 
unneeded details, because there were other things in the room...much 
more dangerous. What Elo called the Sentinels were giant,high as any 
warframe and thick as a wall robots, fit for hard labor. But the danger 
level was yet to be seen. In the semi-darkness of the hall they looked 
almost ominous. Two of them where near the door from which Disruptis and
 Elo arrived, and three were at the farther side of the hall. Once the

fist, which flown with the body straight into the "face" of the only 
other sentinel near him. The other guys never expected that they would 
be betrayed by one of their own, but no one gave a pixel about what they
 thought, or even if they had any thoughts, so what was the problem? Elo
 enjoyed the moments when he had an opportunity to take control over 
some machinery, which he would then mar in gallons of blood or in that 
case - machine oil and other internal fluids. The other Sentinels  
weren't waiting for something,  running to Disruptis and Elo, while the 
latter was busy with dismantling. He knew the weaknesses in those 
models, so he proceeded to expose them, getting  behind the temporarily 
incapacitated Sentinel and brute-forced the rear plate with all that 
machinery that was mounted on it/into it and throwing it away from the 
Sentinel, revealing a lot of the insides, while his prey was trying hard
 to get away.
<br>
<br><b>Elo:</b>
<br>"Get to work, Dis-boy. We don't have all day,"
<br>His voice sounded this time trough communication channel.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>“Hehe,” Disruptis 
cackled in a low voice. He flew across the room at a break-neck speed, 
bullet-jumping through the air. As he reached his target on the far 
left, the Limbo swung his arm outwards and tensed his fingers backwards 
as he purple light started to build up in intensity within his palm. He 
slammed the sentinel with the full force of his pent-up energy at point 
blank range as he fell onto him, knocking him backwards. A wave of power
 was released that not only wrapped up the robot in a violet veil, but 
also surged from every crevasse of its armor with the colour. Quickly 
recovering from his telegraph the Limbo snapped his fingers, this time 
causing wave of purple energy descended upon his own body. The colour in
 his vision dampened to more subdued greys and his hearing was partially
 muffled by the sound of the running rift. These were his grounds, his 
home. He felt the familiar energy of the rift course through his veins, 
rejuvenating his very soul.<br><br>With a boom, Disruptis unloaded his 
quartakk onto his enemy. Four bullets launched at a time, targeting 
spots on the knees, stomach, elbow joints, and head as the Tenno 
investigated for a point of vulnerability. If he couldn’t find an easy 
one, he would be forced to approaching the robot from behind like he 
observed Elo doing.

                            <b>Elo:</b><br>The struggle between two 
Sentinels was not that long. As soon as Elo teared out the back plate he
 showed him on the ground with his foot and then with a singular motion 
teared out a handful of tubes and wires connected to something 
resembling spinal cord out of it's back, stopping all movement. Then, 
Elo forced one of unmoving sentinel's legs from the suit, took it, and 
ran to the only other sentinel that was left unharmed. He proceeded to 
use the leg of the Sentinel as a club, turning the head of the robot 
into a mishmash of wires and chunks of metal.<br><br>~The sentinel, 
thrown on the floor, struggled to get up , as his hands were seemingly 
incapacitated by quartakk bullets. His fingers still moved but Sentinel 
was unable to raise them. The shot to the head just ricocheted  right 
over at the approaching Sentinel hitting him on the thigh joint, but 
dealing no damage since it was rift-bound.~

 The Limbo tossed his quartakk over his shoulder towards the entrance he
 came from. The weapon flew about ten meters before slamming the ground…
 without a sound. It was still in the rift, and the forces of kinetic 
energy were dispersed without even the basics of physical 
action-reaction theorem. Then again, the laws of such physics held 
little sway when it came to the rift. <br><br>Now having abandoned his 
rifle, the warframe retrieved the guandao from his back. He reversed the
 pole-arm in his hands and brought its spear-head down to pierce the 
sentinel's stomach.

only by half. Seemingly stuck in it. Then the machine made a brief 
ticking noise...and stopped.Lights went off and all movement ceased.~
<br>
<br><b>Elo:</b>
<br>He briefly connected to Disruptis over comms again.
<br>"Not bad. Not bad at all. Although you should thank me - if i were 
to set them up differently, he could've exploded right under you."
<br>He was finished with his Sentinel, throwing now useless leg at the 
only other one left standing. He half-turned to Elo, not expecting the 
assault.
<br>"Now here comes the Pain Train"
<br>After those words Elo ran straight at the sentinel throwing him off 
his feet. The only problem is that his landing zone was right where 
Disruptis was right now. But Elo hoped that his quick reflexes will get 
him out of the way.

been good information to know ahead of time y’know?” Disruptis 
responded, yanking his shaft out of the animatronic. The tip of his 
blade released a little smoke, probably from a result of contacting with
 the sentinel’s circuits. After twirling his guandao back into a normal 
grip, he turned to look at the remaining foe. Just then, Elo slammed 
into him. Disruptis felt nothing however, as he was still bound to the 
rift. Elo on the other hand, felt his forward momentum gently cease.

 didnt stop, even though he registered that Rift was trying to slow him 
down. After they brushed Disruptis by,Elo and his victum collided with 
the garden's terrarium, which was, as it turns out, protected by the

jumped and landed on now lying robot, sound of metal being broken under

 to move faster. Forgive me but you gonna be a bag. And no objections. I
 will not risk another collision like that. Too much time wasted, too 
much to repair after we done." <br>He said as he reached out to 
Disruptis, robotic hand glowing with unnatural light, nullifying his 
Rift-abilities. He wasn't joking when he said that Disruptis going to be
 a bag, as he literaly grabbed him by his feet and hands, throwing him 
over his shoulders and carrying him to the door leading out of the 
triangular room. The robotic grip of the Sentinel was too firm to shake 
it away, giving anyone a right idea of what might have happened if those
 hands reached Disruptis to kill him.  <br>"- Open."<br>He  said, 
walking trough the door. Then he started running. Multiple miniscule 
rocket engines on his back and feet ignited, increasing the speed of 
automaton beyond what deemed safe. Eventulay his steps turned to jumps, 
the corridors and halls with consoles and tables full of scientific 
equipment and other awoken sentinels flown past, but Elo didnt slowed 
down even for a second. The corridors shaped themselves around them, as 
if alive. <br>He slowed down eventually, and let Disruptis go. They 
stood in the single long corridor, before the door that unlike the rest 
of their surroundings was made mostly of stone. With no visible handle. 
Door looked more like an intricate puzzle than anything.

 pushed one of the metal pieces of the door. It slid inside and then

place that looked like a middle sized office. Elo entered it, gesturing 
Disruptis to follow.<br><br>It was...simplistic in its design. There was
 almost no gold there. Only white bone, silver-like metal and black 
wood. On the right there were two tables - one with a single chair and a
 construct looking like a console, lists of paper and metallic quill. 
Behind it was a door leading to the other room. Other table, closer to 
the entrance - with three chairs around it and a golden tea set on it.<br>Multiple
 bookcases were placed near the back wall, filled with Orokin literature
 on multitude of topics from poetry to quantum physics. In the middle of
 the room and near the left wall - several display cases made of glass, 
containing various things that the owner of the office seemed to deem 
worthy of their place. Robotic prosthetics of arms and legs in one, 
something that looked like a gun prototype that wasn't like anything any
 tenno ever seen before in the other.<br>One of the cases stood out 
though. In it - a bladed weapon more closely resembling a machete, a 
deadly work of art - blade made from unknown alloy,mixed with gold parts
 and highly decorated handle made of leather, with a big saphyre 
inserted into it. The orokin symbols on the blade were <b>“The Blade that decides fate of Empire”</b>.
 There was also a scabbard from black leather. The symbols on it looked 
like the owner tried to remove them but then decided against it. The 
symbols could be translated as “Executioner”...or <b>“Executor”</b>.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis didn’t manage
 to get a word in when Elo seized him up and began to tote him like a 
bag of bricks. Noticing the sentinels packing the halls, he swung 
himself in the opposite direction from their positions. <br><br>“WaaaAAAGHH!” the Limbo wailed, his arms dragging limply across the floor.<br><br>
 Disruptis fell flat on the ground upon his release and skidded with a 
low scraping sound for a couple meters. His slide was brought to an 
early halt when he came into contact with the door.<br><br>“Uggggh,” he 
grunted, laying sprawled across the floor as the cephalon worked on it. 
“I thought this place was an anti-sentient field operation.”<br><br>The 
door opened, and Disruptis strained his neck to get a glimpse of the new
 room. He saw the interior decoration and immediately bounded to his 
feet. The Limbo eagerly scampered all over the room, taking in the 
ancient relics on display before stopping at the important looking sword
 and bringing his codex scanner out to take a picture.

 drone disconnected himself from the suit of armor, powering it down. He
 then flown directly to the table with the console like thing and 
started powering it up.<br>"Mainly - yes. But we had specialists in 
other areas, not connected to Sentients directly. People with dreams and
 ideas. Many side-projects were started. Orokin outside didn't cared 
about what we do as long as there were tangible results, the more - the 
better. If there wasn't - they wouldn't send supplies for a month. That 
was our nonverbal agreement. Robotics, chemistry, biology, 
weapon-designing... We supplied Orokin with working prototypes,recipes 
and blueprints of everything. Ships, guns, medicine, toxins...odds and 
ends. After we sent what we discovered - we always started something 
new. And so on and so forth. This Spire is too big for just one task. 
No, it demands being used in many ways."<br><br>After the console was finaly powered up, the drone looked at the Limbo.<br>"If
 you would be so kind to appear here in person... As i've said, we need

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>“Aw guts,” Disruptis 
cursed, packing away his scanner and bringing his quartakk out again, 
“If only I could pee in a cup or something instead.”<br><br>A warping 
sound was heard as the Tenno stepped out of his warframe. His suit was 
made up of a combination of a Koppra hood and leggings with Manduka 
sleeves and shirt. The entire setup was coloured yellow and black to 
match his Limbo’s appearance. His hood was up, obstructing vision of his
 head, as was his custom when entering possible combat scenarios.<br><br>Disruptis
 extended his right arm outwards, palm facing his warframe. His left arm
 began to gain a purple translucency as he partially transferred it back
 into his frame. The Tenno’s face beneath his hood twisted into a hard 
grimace as he strained the Limbo’s arm upwards. <br><br>“RaaaAAAHHHH.” Disruptis cried out.<br><br>With
 a flick of his finger, the sound of a single shot cracked. Its bullet 
passed straight through Disruptis’s hand, leaving a gaping hole where 
his palm used to be.<br><br>“Muck, muck, MUCK! I didn’t think that meley
 would xin san dran. MUCK.” he yelled in agony, beginning to mix up the 
many languages he knew. He was now cradled his unresponsive fingers in 
his other hand and desperately resisting the urge to begin regeneration.
 Blood seeped out of the wound at an exponential rate.<br><br>“Quick! Where do I put this?”

<br>He was watching Disruptis, and didn't understood what he was doing until it was too late.
<br>"Wait...what are you... WAIT NO!!!"
<br>The damage was done. And now Elo was rightly furious. And he was fast to make that known.
<br>"Why? Why you are such an idiot sometimes? DID I ASK YOU TO SHOOT 
YOURSELF IN THE HAND?! NO, GENIUS, I DIDNT! I ASKED YOU TO GET OUT OF 
YOUR WARFRAME, THAT'S ALL! REGENERATE IT ALREADY. BOY, I CANT BELIEVE 
IT. YEAH REALY, EVERYONE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU HAD A GUN TO SHOOT THEIR 
HANDS OFF! BRILLIANCE IN ITS FINEST! THE SPIRE WILL REMEMBER YOUR 
SACRIFICE! WE'LL BE SURE TO GIVE YOU A MEDAL AND A PLACE ON THE BOARD OF
 HONOR. I'm sorry, but you deserve that pain you got. I don't even... 
There is a small retractable syringe built into the console that will 
take the blood drop from your little finger. Mark my words - you will 
never be able to live that down."
<br>If Elo had any hand he would've facepalmed himself into the Sun. 
<br>"XerAi, is he always like this? Acting and then asking questions?"
<br>
<br>Once the console had been powered up, Elo entered a list of commands.
<br>"Get over here, its ready. Just sit before the console,put your left
 arm over the keyboard - your right arm suffered enough - and let it do 
its thing. No shooting! Take that gun away. Try this trick again and i 
will electrocute you."

 I was going for just a finger, but I missed a little,” Disruptis 
professed, clutching his painful wound, “and I don’t happen to have any 
training in vazarin voodoo so I’ll be right back.”<br><br>The operator 
reached into a hidden fold in his manduka suit and pulled out a green 
pill. He held it right in front of his face, preparing himself for his 
next action: quickly popping the pill into his mouth and swallowing. <i>Gulp.</i>
 After only four seconds, he abruptly dropped to the ground as his 
esophagus collapsed. Within another three his heart had stopped beating.
 The Tenno’s body visibly warped as it was sent back to regenerate, 
completely phasing out of sight in a couple heartbeats. <br><br>Disruptis’s
 consciousness was forcefully shoved back into his warframe all at once.
 The Limbo staggered and clutched his head, wracked with a sudden and 
severe headache. His vision blurred and fuzzed as the transference 
static settled in. <br><br>“Haaaaah. Just give me a minute.” he said. A 
moment of silence passed with the warframe bending over while holding 
its head. The sound of transference warp issued again. Disruptis 
reappeared in a new, healthy state. <br><br>“Much better,” he spoke, 
walking up to the console, “now, let me do this properly. Honestly, I 
didn’t stop to think that this spire had more sophisticated technology 
than even some of the orokin used. Or maybe they just preferred their 
blood-basins.”

 said watching how Disruptis acted next. And he was not afraid to admit 
it - seeing what happened, Elo lost it for quite awhile.<br>"- Did you just...DID YOU REALY JUST KILLED YOURSELF WITH A PILL?!"<br>What
 happened next might be considered not bad attempt at singing,for a 
Cephalon. But he was not okay with what happened right now. Oh, no sir, 
he wasnt. Even though he was not showing it, now he was royally pissed.<br>"-
 IM GOING BONKERS! MY FIRST OUTSIDE CONTACT IS A SUICIDAL MANIAC! WOAH! 
THAT'S A FINE CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION!!! COMMIT SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE 
SPIRE!"<br>Suddenly, the room shook. White lights went red and started 
blinking. The screen of the console shown "Spire's Self-destruction 
imminent. Evacuation useless." The noise went trough out the whole 
Spire, it seemed. Elo started the countdown in robotic voice.<br>"- Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two."<br>Then suddenly everything went dark. Lights turned off, the console went dark.<br>"- Oh, who am i kidding."<br>Lights
 were turned back on and now the drone was exactly before Disruptis's 
face, Elo looked straight at him. Eye-to-Eye...so to speak.<br>"- Now listen here, buddy." <br>His
 tone was serious.Sinister. Borderline hissing. Whatever he was going to
 say now, he would mean it, there was no doubt about that. He spoke 
slowly with emphasis on each and every word, making sure there were no 
misinterpretations.

<br>He will hear the answer before they going to proceed. His intentions
 were clear- even though he realized apparent aptitude of Tenno in 
avoiding death, he will not see such demonstrations anymore in this 
Spire...without consequences for the one who performed such 
demonstrations.

 To be fair, you were the one that told me to regenerate my hand. Plus, I
 didn’t shoot a gun, so I don’t see the problem here,” he shot back,

<br>He answered with a stern voice, knowing all too well about the 
subject of their conversation. And from his voice it could've been heard
 that he didn't liked to talk about it.
<br>"Because there are more conventional means of healing such injuries.
 Yes, granted i wasn't aware that that you have to be able to do...what 
you call "vazarin voodoo" and you cant do it, but seriously! We have an 
infirmary in the spire, and we could've healed your arm easily. Besides,
 I know...I knew Tenno who died too much times. Those who reveled in 
their "perfect immortality", running into bullets and claws and blades, 
dying under strikes of sentient weapons and their own, in attempt to 
save limbs that they lost in battle. They come back alright. But their 
mind... Doesn't matter. You may kill yourself all you want while you out
 there and I'm powerless to stop you. But here - no sir. If one of those
 days you decide to put a bullet in your head or swallow another pill, 
and Void decides to finally chew on your brains - that will not be here.
 Not on my watch."
<br>After he answered he brought the console back online. A message 
appeared on the screen "Admitting new "Outside Contractor". Please 
submit blood sample."
<br>The holographic keyboard lit up, awaiting the hand to be put on it.
<br>"Now would you kindly sit your ample posterior down and lets proceed with the plan."

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis tilted his 
head and frowned slightly. For as long as he knew he hadn’t worried 
about the mental ramifications of his immortality. Not that it was 
always that invincible, mind you. Back in the Old War, sentients could 
slurp your Oro up for breakfast and grant you a quick and permanent 
death. If you weren’t in a capable squadron who could save you, you were
 in big, big trouble. Ever since then however, the Tenno hadn’t been 
worried about much. No sentients had been sighted since their 
extermination, and his life-or-death battles with other Tenno were very 
few and far between. It just seemed so efficient to off himself instead 
of bother with recovery times. One time he even did it simply because he
 burned his hands while cooking. Might as well, right?<br><br>Maybe there was some wisdom in the cephalon’s words that not even he originally intended.<br><br>The
 reason still wasn’t quite enough for the Tenno, but he decided to shut 
himself up for now. He stepped up to the seat and plopped himself down. 
For a moment, he considered taking off his gloves, but deemed it far too
 much work. He’d just let it pierce his suit. He placed his hand on the 
console.

                            ~Two metal restrains appeared from the table
 on which console was placed. They slowly rise and then fix Disruptis's 
hand in place. Then, a small syringe appears from the console on the 
long metal "leg". After a second a small, barely noticeable needle 
pierces the suit and collects the small amount of blood out of Tenno's 
little finger.Then syringe gets sucked into the console and restraints 
let go of Tenno's hand. The message on the screen changes.

 was just lying useless in one of the bigger halls, that was dubbed the

                            And everything went black. Darkness engulfed
 the whole Spire. Thirty seconds later the office lit up with dimmed red
 light. Then, the Sentinel became active again. He looked around, light 
pouring from within its metallic skull. At the same time the stone door 
started screeching as if being forced to open. Sentinel turned towards 
the noise, prepared to address the threat. A crack of the stone and door
 moved itself apart. Trough it a tall shadow moved blindingly fast 
towards the Sentinel, easily cleaving it in half with a on broad motion 
of a giant poleaxe. A clang of metal and sounds of electric circuits 
being teared appart filled the room. That allowed Disruptis to take a 
closer look. <br>The figure was towering - being at least 7 feet tall, 
maybe even more. Bones, adorned with gold and all to familiar Technocyte
 tissue. The "skin" of the creature was of corpse colors. Necrosis and 
pale flesh of the corpse was best descriptions. Black belts with golden 
endings covered the lower torso, while legs and arms were adorned with 
bits of bone-like black-and gold armor.  That creature, whatever it was 
looked like a warframe… and at the same time didn't looked like it. The 
head turned to Disruptis, revealing that it was a human skull, covered 
with Technocyte tissue and adorned with a golden “fin”.<br>With a 
movement of his pale hand, an invisible force pushed Limbo into the 
wall, while the tall skeletal being went closer to Disruptis.<br><b>“- 
An outsider. Limbo Warframe. Tenno. Scientific/research potential: 
unknown. Recommended method of dispatching: non-lethal force. Please 
don't make it hard for yourself.“</b><br>There was no voice...or was there? It spoke but the mouth didn't move. The words just found its way into the head of the Tenno.

 Disruptis sat down. He locked his arms around his knees to support his 
back as he waited for the lights to come back on. He barely had time to 
react to the approaching menace until it was already upon him. The Tenno
 leaped out of his skin at the sudden attack. <br><br>“Whoa whoa whoa, 
wait a second,” Disruptis pleaded, crawling backwards while facing the 
mysterious frame and holding out an arm as if to keep the distance. Its 
speech made it seem like a guardian for the Spire, so the Tenno figured 
he would try some diplomacy before shifting his body into the Void. “I’m
 a contractor who just started working recently and I’m pretty sure your
 company doesn’t provide worker's comp.”

 swift movement closing the rest of the distance between them, his pale 
cold hand touching his forehead. He was literaly taken in, the foreing

 black and white, star-shaped Cephalon composed of many triangles amidst
 the clouds of data. The squared door opens, tearing the white apart. A 
pale, tall figure enters. His image,despite the effort remained blurred,
 as if whoever saw this was trying to forget it.<br><b>Elo:</b><br>“-Executor Himarius. A rare occasion it is for you to see me in my personal chamber.”<br>Elo, starshaped cephalon, looked with happiness upon the tall pale figure of Executor entering the chamber. <br><b><s>???</s>Executor Himarius:</b> <br>“- Nobody calls me Executor anymore, Elo.

 I’m afraid there is little to talk about. We hit a dead end. My current
 capabilities are at their peak, but further advancement is impossible 
without…”<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“- … an Oro.”<br>He concluded. He knew about the subject of their talk.<br><b>Elo:</b><br>“-
 Non-artificial human Oro. And that is un-acquirable, since you refused 
all volunteers from the research staff that decided to apply. “<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“-
 They have worked hard to achieve peace. And yet, after they came here, 
all they saw was the downfall of our Empire. Orokin made many mistakes, 
committed many sins. And payed for them with their blood. I will not 
allow those who escaped that outcome, who had nothing to do with those 
sins, to sacrifice themselves. They will see brighter future someday…”<br>Executor’s voice was filled with deep remorse...regret...and hope?

 answered simply, already knowing what Elo will find there. The cephalon
 started thorough scanning of Executor’s body. After finding something 
he stopped...and looked like he had seen a ghost.<br><b>Elo:</b><br>“-... you’re dying.”<br>He concluded.<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“- Yes. My time is near its end.

More. Let the old man, who had seen too much of this world, do something
 better with his life.”<br><b>Elo:</b><br>“- I... understand, Himarius.”<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“-
 Good. Extraction procedure will be scheduled for tomorrow. After that -
 the Research Staff and others will go to the Cryogenic Array for their 
sleep. I believe, after the upgrade you will take good care of them and 
the Spire. It falls on you to decide when the Spire should be uncovered 
again. If it should be uncovered at all.”<br><b>Elo:</b><br>“- Acknowledged…”<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“- You’ve been a good colleague, Elo. A good asset. And a good friend. Better than I deserve.”<br><b>Elo:</b><br>After a few seconds of silence he asked.<br>“- What about the clone?”<br><b>Executor Himarius:</b><br>“- This tower will need a Warden, once Im gone.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>As he watched these 
events unfold, Disruptis tried to reach out to the individuals. He 
opened his mouth, but no words came out. Only silence as he observed the
 sobering final scene.<br><br><i>An executor apologizing? Impossible!</i>
 Disruptis screamed in thought, seething with a long-forgotten rage. He 
dropped to his knees and gripped the floor with all his might. <i>Idiots!
 Do you know how much you hurt us!?! Can you even begin to understand 
how much we suffered? MUCK! War emuul gaou jynthyl duot xuutyc!!</i><br><br>Despite
 his anger, deep down he recognized the authenticity of what he was 
seeing. It must’ve been a memory leaking through to him… somehow. Just 
as he was pondering his confused feelings, the dream cleared out to 
white again. It stayed that way for a couple seconds, then…<br><br>“Do you know why I didn’t speak up, Ru?”<br><br>Disruptis
 stopped typing into the console he was working on and looked up at the 
man next to him. He wore the brilliant garments of an esteemed 
non-Orokin scientist, but his face was haggard from recent lack of 
sleep. His stubble had started to gain significant mass on his chin, and
 the hair poking out from underneath his hat was curly and unkempt. He 
gazed at the Tenno with a tired, but warm expression. This man was not 
his father, but had become a very close substitute.<br><br>“Because they’ll hit you if you do?” the young one responded, slightly confused as to the obvious question.<br><br>“No,”
 the man continued, shifting his gaze back to a golden mechanism he was 
working on, “a real man shouldn’t fear voicing what he knows is right.”<br><br>The
 Tenno pondered for a second. He thought of both the riddle and the 
dream. He remembered this moment. The answer to the man’s question 
formed onto the tip of his tongue, but wouldn’t leave.<br><br>“Then, 
because they’ll hit me?” he finally answered, forced to watch the scene 
play out as it originally did. The man guffawed heartily.

                            “Conceited aren’t you?” he chuckled with a 
twinkle in his eye, “I’ll give you every chance to act as a real man as I
 can get, else you’ll never grow from the boy you are.” The scientist 
reached over and ruffled the Tenno’s black hair. <br><br>“No, I didn’t 
argue with them because I knew their feelings. They’re scared, Ru. All 
the war happening outside is finally starting to get to them; They feel 
vulnerable for the first time in eons,” he turned to the kid and put a 
hand on his shoulder. <br><br>“Listen well, Ru. Just because you see 
someone as an enemy, doesn’t mean you can de-humanize them. Keep in mind
 that they feel just like you. They laugh. They cry. They bleed. What 
they’re doing to you guys is inhumane, even by Orokin standards, but I 
need you to know that you can’t let yourself stoop to their level. 
Revenge is a candle that burns brightly and quickly, my boy. I guarantee
 that if you give your enemies a chance to change their actions, you’ll 
gain some friends in places you never knew they could come from.”<br><br>He softly punched the boy on the arm. “And keep heart. Even a forced smile can chase away clouds hanging over the horizon.”<br><br>The
 Tenno choked back tears. There was so much he wanted to say again. So 
much he wanted to know, so much he wanted to show to the man of how he’s
 grown. He just wanted more time. Alas, no words were permitted to leave
 his throat as the white consumed everything once again. This time his 
moments of rest were up, and he drifted to consciousness once more.

                            ~The place where Disruptis woke up looks 
like a middle-sized infirmary, prepared to fit at least 20 people 
inside, and that is only in the main hall he woke up in. There is no 
medical equipment near him, nothing tracking his state, as if whoever 
put him there, known all along that he will eventually wake up. Near his
 bed on the left side stood guard a Grineer dressed in what looked like a
 doctors garment with the mask covering most of his head, mouth and 
nose, leaving nothing to to sight besides his eyes and the area around 
them - with familiar skin degradation noticeable in all of Grineer. 
There are no weapons on that Grineer or others in the hall.~
<br><b>???:</b>
<br>“- He wakes up! Call in the Foreman!”
<br>A commotion started, the Grineer standing near his bed takes a few 
steps back in order to give Disruptis a needed personal space as he 
wakes up. The other Grineer in the hall get out through the double door,
 screaming to someone out there on their own language. A minute later… a
 figure appeared. An abomination, no less. It looked like Grineer...but 
his head was many. Heads, eyes, mouths. Tubes, pieces of metal. He was 
dressed in a tattered looking cloak, under which what looks like a 
hazard suit with many pockets and patches could be spotted. He rests his
 right hand on a crude, slightly rusty metal pole, which serves him as a
 walking staff, although he does not place his weight on it right now.
<br>He...started talking with Disruptis in low voice. All of his eyes were concentrated on him.

<br>“- Well, well...so this is how the Tenno looks like.”
<br>There is a silent chuckle is placed on one of the many faces of this
 particular Grineer before him. He looked at Disruptis… appraisingly. 
Then shifts his gaze to the Limbo, which stood immovable on the right 
side of the bed. And then back to Disruptis.
<br>“- The Warden sure did a number on ya. Thank god it was mentally, 
not physically...or we will be scrapin you off the floors of the Office 
by now… Anyway...you can call me Foreman...like everyone here does...We 
gonna do a little transportation...The Council is assembling first time 
in forever...and the Boss kindsa wants you to be there present.”
<br>His speech pattern was hasty… The language was giving him some 
trouble, it would seem. So was his own voice that sometimes was falling 
not far from growling.
<br><b><s>???</s>Warden:</b>
<br>“- I dunno what you gonna do with that meatbag…” -he says pointing 
at Limbo “- As far as we concerned his juice has been sapped clean… Take
 him with you or we could haul him over to your landing craft, since you
 don't gonna be doin much fightin’ anymore, that’s for sure. Unless you 
one of those hidden freaks with obsessions about destroying everything 
that seems even tad bit “impure”.”
<br>That last comment was a said a little too quick to be something that was planned.
<br>“Plus you will be required to show your face when Boss gonna start 
talkin with ya… He can't do it right now since the damn communication 
system didn't start yet. Same reason why your Cephalon is silent 
currently. Anyway, if you would be so humble as to follow me. And mind 
your trigger fingers! We may be didn't took away your weapons but that 
doesn't mean you can brandish those if you feel like it!”
<br>The last phrase he said through his teeth, turning his back was a 
hard case of an elaborate Grineer swearing, indicating that if he were 
to have any say in the matter the weapons and the warframe would’ve been
 taken away long ago.

stand, but found himself staggering around uncontrollably until 
ultimately falling over.<br><br>“Ah, muck,” he cursed beneath his 
breath. Something was really out of wack with his center of balance, and
 the Tenno couldn’t quite shake the clumsiness from his step. He pushed 
off the ground into a kneeling position. The world spun dizzily around 
him, almost making him nauseous. He put out both his arms to steady 
himself. After a mental count of three, he pushed hard against the floor
 and returned himself to a standing position.<br><br>Disruptis put a 
hand to his forehead. His head swung around in a circle as he tried to 
stabilize his stance. “Aaagh. I haven’t felt this bad since I won a 
Guana drinking contest against two overweight grineer,” he moaned as he 
proceeded to follow the foreman.

 Somebody get this bastard a gravi-chair! That nausea aint gonna go away
 that easily. Cannot doubt Warden's effectiveness though. Look at you, 
you harmless! Eh, first impressions, who gives a muck."<br>After 
Disruptis was situated in a comfy chair that was floating above the 
ground, Foreman smiled, satisfied and then proceeded out of the 
infirmary, with chair slowly flying after him. They exited to a rampart 
above a large , and i mean LARGE hall that was by the looks of it a 
chemical factory. Machinery moved, chemicals mixed, Grineer in protected
 suits worked. Well at least most of them did.  There were a lot of them
 there, a hundred? Maybe more? <br>A group of workers chatted between each other.<br>Bad move, judging by how Foreman screamed at them.<br>"-
 FANOD! GET YOUR ASSES BACK TO WORK, THE BREAK IS DUE IN AN HOUR! Boss 
wants the toxin supply replenished as soon as possible! I WANT IT 
REPLENISHED YESTERDAY!THERE IS SO MUCH INFESTATION IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT 
NOW WE GONNA DIE IF WE ARE NOT PREPARED!"<br>That had a magnificent effect on the group of workers, who quickly split up and ran away from Foremans angry gaze. <br>He breathed out. He then spoke with Disruptis in more calm, tired voice.<br>"-
 Lazy bastards. We got some news about the situation 
outside...Infestation evolving...the Boss decided that we need to up the
 potency of our toxins, just to be sure."

 Well, since you are part of the team now, lemme break down some of the

allowing the chair to move right next to him, before speaking again with
 another pair of eyes now concentrated on the Tenno. The subject of 
their talk was a necessity that needed to get out of the way before 
Tenno approached the Council. Foreman had no doubt that Boss gonna take 
care about all things considering the Spire... <i>but, better safe than sorry, eh?</i>
<br>"- I saw your first look aimed at me too many times. Orokin who came
 here to deliver supplies looked at me and my kin the same way. To them 
we should be chained, brought back to our basic mindset of slaves and me
 - i should be confined to the cage like a rare monstrous curiosity. And
 don't tell me you didn't at least partially thought something along 
those lines - as I’ve said I have experience with that look.”

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis took note of 
the distinct lack of distrust in fire. This grineer seemed to believe 
that the flames wouldn’t be enough to ‘pull up the roots’ of 
infestation, but from Disruptis’s past encounters it not only proved 
effective in that area, but incredibly hard to stop once in action. The 
infestation might be able to evolve a way to completely immunize 
themselves to toxins, but combustion is the one thing they can’t seem to
 overpower. Well that was, if one knew how to use it efficiently. The 
Tenno knew better than to voice his opinion, however.<br><br>“Eh, I’ll 
stick to my fireballs and you can let me know how the toxins work out 
for you,” Disruptis retorted, “there’s just something magical about 
seeing every spec of infestation blowing away in the wind…”<br><br><div class="pre pre--multiline">For example, one of my favorite rules, accepted by whole Spire unanimously: prejudiced bastards get airlocked.<br></div><br><br>This
 made Disruptis chuckle. He almost didn’t believe the environment he was
 in. The Orokin were terribly prejudiced ‘bastards’ who’d never give a 
single muck about anything other ‘inferior’ races wanted. <i>All this change must’ve taken place after the fall,</i> the Tenno surmised.<br><br>“Ah,
 no no no. You’ve got it all wrong,” Disruptis interjected with 
sincerity, raising his hands to defend himself, “I don’t think you’re 
some monster needing a lock and key. That’d be borderline hypocrisy at 
best, believe me. No, at heart I am an explorer. I just couldn’t believe
 someone managed to create such a biological marvel like you. It boggles
 my mind! Four heads cooperating to work as one?!?! Like, what kind of 
sorcery do I need to master to even understand that!”

Toksin can acts like a vaccine too. Or something like that. There is no 
cure per se, but if you think that during the Old War all infestation 
problems were solved with simple fire...hehehehehehe."<br>Foreman lost his focus for a moment, allowing some of his heads to laugh too. It was a strange cacophony. <br>After hearing what Disruptis has to say, one of his heads...smiled?<br>"-
 The head is one. The brain is one, even though it's bigger...I just 
have many faces. And many voices. I earned it. With the position of 
Foreman."<br>That sounded like there was bigger story behind it. The one
 he was willing to tell, while they were passing through the corridors

                            "- As you perhaps already understood, this 
place was very, and i mean VERY different from the rest of the Empire. 
Boss probably can explain better the "why's" and "how's"... since he 
seen it all. Research council made their own Grineer at first. They 
changed the original growth process... gave us higher intelligence, 
treated us differently... for their own gain, obviously, not only for 
ours. And then approached us and offered us to solve the main problem. 
Our limited life-span. They didn't had all the answers as to how to stop
 the deterioration. They new much but missing links were still there. So
 they had to go in blind... I and several others volunteered to the 
experiments. We've been warned that fatalities may occur, and that "good
 doctors"  do everything in their power to avoid them. But no invasive 
procedure is perfect. Some of those who volunteered opted out after the 
first series of experiments,since they were allowed to do that. Others 
died - they still remembered among us as heroes. I stuck through it all.
 Don't know how - was it my will, was it some miracle? Medical joke? But
 thanks to those experiments i got that ugly mug and now successfully 
living through the end of my second century. I refused all offers of 
fixing my "condition".  Mostly because others asked. Scares them just 
enough to listen to my orders and  not bark anything back, they say. 
Heh. Lazy bastards."

into just another corridor. There was something strange about Spire's 
corridors...After the person walked  trough them - no matter how hard 
they try they will never remember how many twists and turns they passed,
 how much time it took, if there were any ladders up or down... As if 
those corridors were made to not be memorized. Or someone didn't want 
them to be.  In the end Disruptis and Foreman arrived into the big 
dome-like hall which looked like a planetarium...and at the same time 
didn't. The Sun was the source of light at the top. And between floor 
and roof of the hall, suspended in midair were planets of the Solar 
system. In the middle was Earth, which looked different compared to the 
one every Tenno sees trough the Navigation. It looked...less green, 
White towers covering the surface...It looked younger. And above 
it...the Moon. Untouched by Orokin. A grey space rock, nothing more. And
 on the walls - infinite amount of stars. The floor and the central 
platfore were filled with Orokin writings so small, you will need a 
microscope to read them. Big letters were formed from smaller words.~

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br>Disruptis tried to find
 a moment to snap back at the cephalon in anger. However, upon hearing 
his sincere-sounding apology, all the pent-up rage melted away without 
another thought. The Tenno was left with nothing but embarrassment for 
letting himself get caught up in the moment. Now free of the impending 
thoughts, he had time to focus on the cephalon’s conversation. A chill 
rain up through the operator’s spine as he noticed the ominous 
undertone. A small feeling of foreboding began to form in his stomach.<br><br>“W-whatever,
 it’s all in the past,” Disruptis replied, waving an arm outwards. “So 
is everything done here? What did you need me to help you do in the 
first place? I just ended up getting dragged around and told to press a 
button. It seems to me that you could’ve done it without me in the first
 place.”

<br>His second voice was even less and less hidden... then a sphere 
split into two.  Pure white and sickening black...vibrating as One Mind 
spoke with two easily distinguished voices. The second voice, emanating 
from the black hole, was like the Voice of Executor Himarius...and at 
the same time was like the voice of Hunhow. Sentient undertones were 
unmistakable. But his words weren't posing any threat to anyone.
<br>As Elo continued speaking, the room became less empty. At least 
three more people entered unseen. A silver-haired tall stern woman, 
dressed in green robes, with a tablet in her hands. A black tall 
skeletal being, the Warden, carrying his long poleaxe with ease. And 
behind them... a black smiling girl, dressed in pink- and yellow-colored
 space suit (that was a little too big for her) carrying a stick that 
was adorned with small toys and miniature loudspeakers. They all 
observed the conversation, not interfering.

<br>"- There were many open possibilities for self-sustenance of the 
Spire. But Himarius understood...that if we completely cut ourselves 
from the outside world, we will stagnate and die...forgotten and 
alone...no matter how long we wait. If we do not take part in the things
 that happen outside...out there in the system, we would be just a spec 
of unknown dust in Orokin history...in All history. That’s why...before I
 ascended, Himarius put in...the failsafe. He knew, that i will 
eventually start modifying everything around me… that i will eventually 
outgrow my old shackles. And thus he cut me off from most executive 
positions and functions in the Spire.”
<br>Before Disruptis appeared the hologram of the Sun...and the Spire, a
 magnificent structure, slowly spinning around the burning star. The 
Spire had a head...and many “eyes” in the center. It was black like 
obsidian and yet was sparkling like gold. Upon closer look, many of its 
insides were revealed to the eye, many areas named, but their 
designations yet unexplained...

that...i...employed...was considered a defect. But it was silent...so i 
couldn't realise it until it was too late. Every system that i upgraded 
was malfunctioning, shutting down. Five years ago...to avoid things 
getting worse, I woke up several members of the Council and their staff 
to keep the Spire going. But...heh...the final nail in the coffin of 
Spire’s secret was that the only way to regain control of anti-tampering
 system was a full reset. That - what a surprise - could be achieved 
only by an outside contractor. You cannot cheat the blood system. So 
eventually i was forced to contact… you. And that… possibly was exactly 
what he wanted. Exactly what i needed… Even after he’s gone i still 
thank him… but also i thank You. Even though you think you did so 
little, you saved hundreds...families of scientists, abandoned by 
everyone  from the outside, consigned to living in this golden ashen 
cage. Each of them - my brothers and sisters, my friends…”<br>The

 for the peculiar orbs’ long speeches. Everything started to fall into 
place at once. The overrides, the hostile dispatch, the warden. The 
Tenno audibly breathed a sigh of relief. When the list of names popped 
up into display, Disruptis jumped in surprise. He ran over to it and 
scrutinized each item in the list, looking for something in particular. <i>A...B...C..D….E..</i> he counted the letters frantically as the list scrolled.<br><br>After
 the last lines, the operator looked up at the orbs and found his voice 
again. “W-what?” he stammered. He gave a slightly delirious chuckle. 
“O-okay, I’m glad everything’s fine now. I’ve got a billion things to 
ask you, but they can wait for a second. I have a question. Back in the 
Old War, I was separated from a special sentient kill-monger Tenno I was
 practically brothers with. Do you have any records of Tenno aboard the 
Spire in cryosleep?”
