        from the other Tenno and didn&#39;t associate with them. So when it came
        time to sleep, Zavis had the brilliant idea of having his pod hidden at
        the end of one of many treasure rooms on Lua guarded by a series of
        tests and/or traps, the last being a riddle room where the answer is
        only possibly known by a Veiled Tenno. Blocks with the Orokin alphabet
        need to be arranged to form the answer otherwise the sentry turrets
        activate. A simple riddle to those who should know the answer, &quot;Who
        is it that rests beyond this door? I watch over my friends with death as
        my ally. I give up on this. Bring cake.&quot; is what&#39;s etched into

        needs to be serious, usually refusing to do even the simplest of tasks
        because it requires &quot;too much effort.&quot; He enjoys the finer
        things in life, especially if those finer things are exotic desserts. He
        enjoys the culinary arts which is probably one of the few tasks where he

        side of the door after the answer is made, the Nekros warframe would
        stand there with its arms crossed, however, it doesn&#39;t seem to be

        for the Tenno to suddenly take up arms and massacre the Orokin people.
        After I woke up a couple decades ago, I did my own research and
        investigation and discovered that a Sentient had managed to make
        it&#39;s way into the Orokin ranks and trick the Tenno into following
        her orders. She was clever and disguised herself as Margulis, which is
        what stole the Tenno&#39;s loyalties. She now goes by the name of
        &quot;Lotus&quot; and uses the Tenno to keep a &quot;balance&quot;
        between the now Grineer Empire, and Corpus Houses.&quot; </span

        >&nbsp;&quot;To make things worse, the Sentients have returned and are
        hunting anything Orokin down and destroying it. There are many Sentients
        on Lua at the present, and even more on Earth and a few on Uranus where
        Hunhow&#39;s bones were discovered. To summarize, the world went down a
        broodmother&#39;s gullet and came out as infested excrement.&quot;</span
