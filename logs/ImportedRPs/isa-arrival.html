        >A Saryn slowly strode through the hallways to the beacon that was
        broadcasting this mysterious signal, a massive, white kubrow following
        behind it, its shoulder level just below that of the warframe. The Lotus
        had warned other Tenno not to approach, but this golden warrior was deaf
        to the Lotus&#39;s beck and call. <br /><br />Having heard the
        transmission, and the rumors of Tenno going missing here, and of the
        Lotus forbidding Tenno from going to this place, Isa felt the need to
        investigate for herself. She wondered if, perhaps, there was some new
        faction coming into play here, one opposed to the Lotus, or if it was
        just a trap set by one of the other primary factions.<br /><br />It
        mattered not to her. For within this frame she was safe from harm. It
        would be an annoying loss to replace, but nothing more. Should it die,
        she had others she could transfer into.<br /><br />The Saryn would stop
        to inspect the corpses of several warframes as they were spotted,
        prodding them with a foot or her rifle, checking the damage they had
        sustained, checking them for vitals. Finding that they were indeed dead,
        killed by Tenno weapons, she would move on. If not, a shot would echo
        out from her Argonak as she put a round into the head of any that had
        somehow survived their injuries, not wishing to be approached from
        behind.<br /><br />Isa entered the chamber where the console lie, and
        remained standing at the doorway, looking about.</span

        acquisition and preservation of knowledge. The Meridian have never
        experienced peace before, and unlike the Tenno who were molded for war,
        they were bred for it. I feel that they would not know what to do should
        peace be attained, and as such any stability they bring would not be
