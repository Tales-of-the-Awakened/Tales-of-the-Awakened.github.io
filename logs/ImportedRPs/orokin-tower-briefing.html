    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&lt;04/2 DR 11:45&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">~A general message goes out to each member in the Orokin Remnant</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Tenno, the time has come to begin preparations for our first move on the Origin
            System. Please come to the command center to I can brief everyone on the first stage of our plan.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Mataeru&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">As the Tenno would file in, they would see their Leader standing, with his arms
            crossed behind his back in front of a large round table. The room is medium sized with a raised platform
            tracing the back wall of the round room containing various view screens showing different locations on Lua,
            some under Grineer control, other&#39;s under Corpus and yet more being contested by the two factions. One
            viewscreen shows the entrance to the &quot;tunnel system&quot; that leads to the broken signal on Lua. There
            are twenty seats in the room to the left of the table when entering by the door, as well as several
            holographic display panels on the walls on either side of the room~</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.82o3uvxwtlr0"><span class="c0"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Disruptis:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Well muck,&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Disruptis muttered to himself as he
            dangled from the ceiling. He had just received the call while he was working on rigging up some networking
            equipment through the barracks. In order to maneuver across the ceiling faster, he had rigged a small
            mechanism to suspend him in the air via strong chords and a harness; A mechanism that malfunctioned a couple
            seconds earlier, leaving him a warframe pi&ntilde;ata. He took a couple minutes to deliberate whether or not
            he actually wanted to sacrifice the chords of his creation, and in the end decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth it.
            The Tenno transferred out of his frame, escaping his prison, and took a couple steps back to view the
            mess.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Hmmm, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c11" id="h.77qpi5krfxbd"><span class="c10 c6">Vuko Drakkainen:</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">~A few moment after the message is relayed, Vuko walks in. The Tenno has
            shoulder-length, deep, ocean blue hair with cyan details peeking through, like waves that shift their colour
            as they get closer to the shore. The hair is swept back, part of it coupled into a ponytail, and holding it
            all together, a yakini diadem. The cloth parts of his outfit, that are in a palette of beige, ashen grey and
            onyx mix with orokin gold metallics. The suit encompasses an almost armor-like design with its sharp edges
            on the metallic parts, resulting in a look that one would expect from a royal guard of sorts, back in the
            glory days of the Orokin Empire.~</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;Ah, I see the others
            haven&#39;t come yet.&quot; - </span><span class="c1">He says, while doing a delicate introductory bow
            towards Mataeru.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- &quot;I&#39;m eager to hear more on this plan of yours, that
            everyone speaks so highly of.&quot; - </span><span class="c3 c1">The Tenno proceeds to a chair at the table,
            one on the left side. If the seat Mataeru was at was 12 o&#39;clock, Vuko would take the one that is 9
            o&#39;clock. He doesn&#39;t take a seat, instead putting his hands on the back of the chair with a
            characteristic &#39;cling&#39; as his metal glove touched the surface. The gesture seems to be out of
            politeness, as it is inappropriate to sit down when the host is standing up.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c13">Devros von Inie:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">There are a lot of things that can catch you by surprise while in the shower, a
            loud booming message that is calling for your attention is one of them. Devros poked his head out of the
            shower so better hear the message that is being relayed by his pocket transmitter that he laid down next to
            his clothes in the laundry bin.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A, shite&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He cursed under his breath and quickly finished washing the soap off his hair
            before exiting the shower and wildly drying himself off&hellip;almost giving himself skid marks at how fast
            he was whipping that towel around. Throwing the used garment without a care, he quickly snatches his
            standard Varida suit and starts putting it on while skipping from one leg to the other on his way outside
            and towards his nightstand.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Meanwhile, Garhul who was happily napping in his own bed near the corner lifted
            his head to curiously gaze at his fumbling master.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Devros grabs his busted and worn glasses, putting them on and looking over to his
            companion who was still looking at him like he was crazy</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oy! Nip on!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">He flails his arm in the air to indicate to the laying behemoth to get his ass in
            gear. Garhul lets out a yawn and stands up, giving his rust colored coat a shake before leaping off his bed
            and following Devros, who already dashed out towards the meeting area.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">A couple of minutes later and the brutish boy and his enormous kubrow walk in, his
            hair in a total wet mess, his suit wrinkled in places, his glasses hanging in a wonky angle and his breath
            coming out in puffs to indicate that he was in a wild sprint just a few second ago. Taking in a deep breath
            to calm himself he lifts his hands and combs his dark hair back and straighten his clothes a bit. Looking
            about he notices Mataeru, and he gives the guy he&rsquo;s met a curt not before looking over to the other
            guy he hasn&rsquo;t met. If Vuko looks towards Devros he will give the other the same nod but otherwise will
            not attempt to chit-chat cause this doesn&rsquo;t feel like the atmosphere for it.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Instead, the messy looking boy will walk about the room eying the projections and
            analysing the images. He stops in front one of them and deeply studies it, stroking his chin as if he has a
            thick long beard.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Garhul stands beside Devrosl but is looking at Vuko with a curious stare as if
            he&rsquo;s perplexed by something, well&hellip;his stare Is actually more directed at the others inquisitive
            hair, at the hue of blue that envelops it.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.rxobkk8lm5kv"><span class="c0"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">The tall Nidus lay across an examination table in the bio lab like a supermodel,
            yawning while stretching.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Come on then, boys,&quot; </span><span
            class="c3 c1">he scolded as two of his quirky, Infested Engineers waddled around the room, feverishly
            pouring various chemicals into an array of 30 petri dishes.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;For the love of the Void, this would be a lot easier if my pipette set was
            around, huh?&quot; </span><span class="c3 c1">Kapak rubbed the bulbous surface of the top of his skull. The
            Engineers both chattered at him, snorting and gurgling an incoherent language. At this point, he heard the
            call from Mataeru and cursed loudly.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;I just started this trial!!&quot; </span><span class="c1">he
            roared,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;I give up. Mephalus, clean this up, eh? We&#39;ll run this series
            later. AND FOR VOID&#39;S SAKES, DO NOT JUST THROW OUT THESE SAMPLES. Make sure you incinerate them.
            Remember what happened last time? Yeah, the tentacle monster that we barely contained? Imagine if bossman
            found out about that... you know how he feels about the infested!&quot; </span><span class="c3 c1">Kapak
            grumbled as he picked himself up off the table. He exited the lab, turning and walking until he came across
            a teleporter pad which beamed him just outside the Mission Control. He enters the room and sees his friend
            Vuko, as well as a new face... and a large dog.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Kedh:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;No no no! It is simply not practical nor efficient. The material you selected

            his meditations in The Dark. His Harkonar augment revved then kicked into a soft hum as his gill-like vents
            opened and shut with a repetitious hiss-click-click as he opened up the front of his Mantis, letting the

            didn&#39;t even know the details this time and managed to catch himself, turning around and taking one of
            the 20 seats on the left, center back. He gives his cheeks a few smacks to wake up and looks around at the
            others currently there, but he wouldn&#39;t speak to anyone just yet. He needs to get his game face on since
            this is apparently something a bit more important. His Nekros stands beside the entrance to the conference

            his eyes looking over the various faces assembled here. Some faces he recognized, albeit from what felt like
            a lifetime ago. He had been wandering, or &quot;Patrolling&quot;, as he would put it, the base when he
            received the call. Looking around for an empty chair, he found one next to an ominous looking guy in a mask.
            He sat down rather heavily in the chair, leaning back and crossing his legs. He looked to Materu. He wanted
            to know what was up, but he was sure the Boss would explain once everyone got here.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Within her own orbiter, Isa had been idle for the past few days... annoyingly so. The
            group had gathered a decent force of Tenno now, 5 cells worth, going by the Lotus&#39;s methods. She had
            expected something to be coming up soon as a result of their swelling numbers. This prevented her from
            wanting to get too involved in any large projects, so she had resorted to simply extensive maintenance of
            her orbiter, landing craft, and personal equipment. She had just finished reassembling and cleaning her
            fourth Argonak when she received the message. She arrived in person shortly, stepping into the room and
            taking a quick look about at her comrades as she sat down in the nearest empty chair, placing her hands on
            her lap. She silently stared at Mataeru, waiting for him to speak.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he moves to his right along the edge of the table, facing the group of chairs and
            nods to those present</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;You may sit or remain standing. That is up to you. The majority of us are here,

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he then types something into the air in front of his face and large holographic
            display of the Origin system appears over the table in the center</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;As you all know, each planet in the Origin system, with the exception of Eris,
            is under Corpus or Grineer control. Our overall mission is to end the war and bring a new era of peace to
            the system. With only twenty strong, we will have to move carefully, decisively and
            strategically.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">~the hologram zooms in on Earth and the few Grineer vessels in orbit. Parts of the
            hologram glow yellow instead of the pale while blue. The ships in orbit, and and certain strongholds on the
            surface, as well as solitary red and blue dots~</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The yellow dots show high priority Grineer targets we need to destroy or
            capture. The red and blue dots respectively are Iron Wake and Cetus. Cetus will likely work with us as a
            staging ground and planetside command center for our forces if negotiations with Steel Meridan do not go as
            planned. However, the issue of getting on the planet remains, and how we are to hold it once we do
            successfully break the Grineer hold. That plan will involve taking control of an Orokin tower, at least one
            Corups battleship and shutting down the solar rails that lead to Earth. The first stage of our plan will be
            to secure an Orokin tower for our cause and relocate our command center from here to there.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He then types in another command and the hologram changes to that of Pluto</span>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I have spent the last few weeks gathering intelligence on a Corpus Scientist by

            Corpus may have an Orokin tower on their hands to fight with, and we are going to prevent that from
            happening.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he pauses as several locations on Pluto highlight in yellow</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Our first mission will require heavy stealth and infiltration. As a result, the
            only team touching down on Pluto will be our infiltrators. We will raid the base at Oceanum and copy the
            data from their vaults to locate Drau. Once we have the location of his carrier, the infiltrator squad will
            then be joined by our assault, support, and defensive based members. The non infiltrators will remain hidden
            until the Infiltrators can successfully disable the ship&#39;s&#39; reactor. The reactor must be sabotaged
            via coolant leak so we have time to extract our information from the Drau. Once the reactor is destroyed,
            the Assault team will take the lead and the infiltrators can choose to withdraw or aid them in the
            extermination of the ship&#39;s crew. Once we have eliminated his security forces, apprehending him should
            be a relatively easy task. We will then secure the information, from and consequently eliminate Drau. Once
            we have the location of the dig site, we will travel there and sabotage their Torsion Beam Generator and
            board the tower together. We must bring Lyria, Dormin&#39;s charge with us and her survival is
            imperative.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He pauses for a moment and the hologram shifts to that of an Orokin tower</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;Once aboard the Orokin Tower, we need to eliminate the entirety of the

            is highlighted in green</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;...Where she will then take control of the tower.

            towards the conference room, wanting to be on time; a feat he would inevitably fail to achieve. As he
            approached, he caught Mataeru&rsquo;s speech just as it ended. Disruptis stopped abruptly before the door,
            crouching low and summoning a veil of the Void so he could sneak in unnoticed. He quickly made his way into
            the room and sat down in the nearest empty seat, which happened to be next to Isa. At once he uncloaked. The
            Tenno gave a Isa a wink and reclined on the chair attempting to mask a solemn and attentive expression,

    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;Aye, I served under Meridian Sergeant Daubeny Cyk for quite a whiles as a
            combat medic. Provided that magnificent, zealous man is still alive and with the Meridian, I bet I could get
            a word out.&quot; *Kapak turned to Dormin. Something bothered him deep down in his core. An Orokin alive?
            Spared? A girl... a noble family....? YOU COULD HAVE SAVED HER. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER. BUT YOU
        </span><span class="c8 c13">SPILLED HER-</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;Dormin is correct,&quot; </span><span class="c1">Kapak cleared his throat as
            his hand retracted,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;having Corrupted troops at our disposal would be most
            advantageous, especially since manpower would be appreciated with such low numbers in our ranks now.
            However, the people of Cetus are known to have quite close connections with the Lotus. They&rsquo;ve been
            asking for thousands of favours from her and her Tenno.&quot; </span><span class="c1">As he finished his
            statement, he noticed that yellow-clothed madman uncloak into a seat just opposite to him. He clucked his
            tongue and wagged his finger jokingly at the fool. Mataeru did not tolerate dilatory behaviour.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c13">Devros von Inie:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Devros twitched in surprise once Mataeru started talking and he whipped around to
            face the group but not making any intention to dart towards one of the chairs, thinking that this talk would
            be a pretty open and shut discussion of mission assignments and tasks. He listened intently and observed
            each presented image with great care to detail. However as more and more information relayed in the open,
            the messy looking boy decided to take a seat after all cause this feels like it&rsquo;s going be turned in
            to more than just a simple debrief. Devros silently walks up to the table and takes one of the seats right
            of Mataeru with Garhul standing to his left but a bit back so to not hog all of the space between his chair
            and the one next to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Leaning forward in his seat, he clasps his palms together and leans his elbows on
            the table before resting his chin at the top of his joined thumbs. He once again listens and observes the
            details as Mataeru spoke on, occasionally giving the tray of goodies a glance, deciding if he should bolt
            for one of the alluring cookies like a starved savage or stand firm and not give everyone the wrong first
            impression. At the mention of a Orokin survivor he furrowed his brows. Can they trust her? Is she really on
            the tenno side?</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">As Mataeru stopped speaking he twirled his eyes to the others that started to
            voice what mostly everyone was thinking. Some of them make a good point. He has yet to personally meet any
            of the people here and yet is expected to work with them like a unit. Devros just hopes they will be given
            some kind of prep time so that he can at least mingle with the squad he&rsquo;s going to be put in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">For now he stays silent, just watching and listening cause there is no need to repeat
            what others have already asked. He gives Kapak a curious glance as he watches the other gobble up the food
            with his infested limb...curious indeed</span><span class="c6">.</span><span class="c0">)</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">/Lekalis/</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Lekalis looked about and humbly greeted the folk who ushered past him quietly as
            he did his best to step out of the way of any of the more... hasty members of the Clan. Though he hadn&#39;t
            considered the prospect of floating sentinels; Ella&#39;s Striker managing to strike Lekalis&#39; good horn
            as he&#39;d turned to greet the Runner.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">It might&#39;ve sent him for a stumble, though he rather easily danced on his feet
            to balance out the set. He applauded himself internally, though murmured a thanks to Sigyn all the same as
            he shifted from one foot the other.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">As Mataeru pressed on with the briefing, he felt a bit lost as he stared at the
            Clan Leader a bit incredulously as he looked down at the platter of tea and cookies he now presumed was
            alright to keep, given the lack of any outright dismissal.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">All the same, Lekalis was a bit tentative as he began to make his way around the
            room, offering the minimalist cookies and brew to those around the room in a smallish manner.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He paid a little mind to Kapak&#39;s organ, which Lekalis quickly made to bat
            away, shooing it and sending a scornful look at Kapak from across the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The Strider kept silent, but for murmuring an offer to the various members around
            the table: Asking them if they wanted tea or cookies, and dolling them out respectively.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He would do his best to work araound the table efficiently, before lastly coming
            to Mataeru and offering what remained.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c2" id="h.p1h9qb31nbp8"><span class="c0"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c10 c6">//Runner</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Runner sighed with relief internally, snatching the loose Carrier to stuff it
            within the Teplo on her back. It made no defiant peep or squirm.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">She stepped quietly towards the further end of the room, making herself as small
            as possible, before accepting the continual Strider&#39;s offer of tea and a singular cookie, wishing she
            could apologize with a whisper, but in the end, futily nodding at his request. She kept the gifts held in
            one hand, making no attempt to leave her frame.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">While the Shadowed Leader gave out his briefing, she paid a curious attentive gaze
            to Kapak, morely, his &#39;Infested&#39; frame and the mouth that nearly vacuumed Lekalis&#39; supplies,
            tilting her bandaged head ever so slightly, a bulbous, purplish cyst contorting mutely on the Banshee&#39;s
            neck. A blue gem glinting from the darkness, moving on to scan the other Tenno in the room amongst
            Mataeru&#39;s planning. A first ever time seeing their faces, or personalities.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">As the mention of a Orokin Noble reached her, a sudden thrum of an echoing headache
            latched onto her conscience, visibly holding the other hand to her head in obvious discomfort. The Cookie
            fell to the floor, shattering silently into four sections, the steaming tea holding steadily. An Orokin
            Noble, still counted among the living.</span><span class="c1 c10">Interesting</span><span
            class="c3 c1">.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Upon Mataeru&#39;s end to his presentation, and upon hearing the concerns and
            requests of the others, Runner abstained from questions, already dealing with a sudden migraine.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Sigyn:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">All thoughts of awkwardness fled as Sigyn&#39;s mind settled in to the familiar
            focus she&#39;d cultivated for all of her mission briefs. Though not the tactical savant some of the other
            Tenno were, the use of maps and diagrams rung true to a long-ingrained habit, her mind clicking with the
            information smoothly and assimilating it. The mention of an Orokin Master sent a brief shiver down her
            spine, but that was also curtailed by the weight of her lingering professionalism.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Unless you have a different place you&#39;d like me to be, I&#39;d request to
            be on the defense squad. Other than that I have no input as to the mission set. Everything looks reasonably
            air-tight.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The laser focus faded as Lekalis swooped by with foodstuffs, which she snatched
            with as much grace as she could despite her obvious eagerness for both cookies and tea. A flicker of
            Unairu-Void, and Sigyn stood in front of her now-rigid Volt, taking the cookies and tea from its hands and
            savoring them quietly, waiting for more to be said.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Isa:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Isa sat &nbsp;stoic as she let Mataeru explain the briefing. She completely
            ignored Disruptis&#39;s appearance, staring ahead at the diagram. She nodded at the strategy for capturing
            the Corpus ship, approving, but the corner of her mouth gave a twitch of disapproval at the mention of
            bringing Lyria to the tower. She waved off Lekalis&#39;s offer of tea and cookies without facing him. She
            was far too focused on the task at hand to wish to take part in any sort of pleasantries.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Are we bringing the Sectarus onto the tower before all the corrupted are
            eliminated? Your plan appears to imply as much. It would be safer to eliminate everything aboard the tower
            before bringing her in, or utilize sentinels, kubrows, and those skilled in the Unairu school to sneak her
            to the top. Furthermore, she could be kept safer in case of emergency through the use of a Limbo to keep her
            within the Rift.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Zavis:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Sat quietly and listened to the plan be laid out. It sounds fine so far except for
            the fact that it seems his job was done for him already. Sabotage to weaken an enemy were his kind of
            tactic, his methods. His mind wandered off, thinking about when Mata might have found the time to take up
            Zenurik philosophies alongside Naramon. He sighed and looked to the entrance in surprise at the latecomer,
            waiting for the rest to ask their questions before he stands to ask his own.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;What would you have me doing exactly?&quot; </span><span class="c1">he chuckled
            lightly with a shrug</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Looks like you already did my job for me.&quot;
        </span><span class="c3 c1">he takes a moment to think over the details that were explained before going
            again.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Before I actually get to my suggestions, I do have a few things I should ask.
            First, you said you want to take a Corpus battleship, why is that? Second, when you say carrier, do you mean
            the scientist is on an actual carrier sized ship? And third, I am not exactly familiar with modern Corpus
            ships, but wouldn&#39;t sabotaging the reactor core put the ship on a timer that eventually destroys
            it?&quot;(edited)</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Cev:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Cev sat and listened intently as Mataeru spoke. He laughed quietly to himself as
            he saw Kapak&rsquo;s appendage reached the tray of snacks. When Mataeru finished, Cev lifted his head from
            the table. He waited for the others to finish asking their questions before he spoke,</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So how long until we begin? Because I would like like to get an understand of
            my teammates capabilities and personalities before hand if possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He put his hands together resting his chin on his thumbs.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c2" id="h.gm472uf4qo9x"><span class="c0"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Mataeru:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">without breaking stride he nods to Disruptis</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I am pleased you decided to join us after the most important part of the
            meeting. I will send you a data packet with a recording of the meeting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He then looks to Vuko</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We will run a couple of missions together with our likeminded or similar
            counterparts. The infiltrators will run a set of or a singular mission together, depending on how well the
            team synergy is, and the more aggressive people and healers will do the same. I will brief you on what the
            infiltration team will be doing. Zavis will direct the combatants.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">His gaze shifts to Senna</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;If you too are a General with the Meridian, then both you, Strider, and anyone
            else who has a high standing with them will go and talk to them. The more of their reputable people that
            meet with Cressa Tal, the better.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">His head turns to Dormin</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We will not be using the Corrupted. The Neural sentry is an abomination, and if
            we use it to meet our goals, we are no better than the people who created them. The tower will be able to
            operate without the Corrupted, and once we secure the tower, we will sync our foundry database with the
            tower foundry, and begin manufacturing Orokin robotics to maintain tower systems until we can acquire an
            organic crew. The tower will be the main hub of our operations and negotiations with the other Syndicates.
            And the last thing we want is to have Corrupted wandering it&#39;s halls.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He then turns his attention to Muro</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I do indeed. I will address team compositions once I have finished answering
            everyone&#39;s questions.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He turns his head towards Kapak</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;If you still hold reputation with the Meridian, then you will go as well. As
            for the Corpus Cruiser, we will not be keeping the vessel. it is merely going to be used in tandem with the
            Orokin tower as a scare tactic against the Grineer. If an Orokin tower shows up in orbit around Earth at the
            same time as one, or possibly two Corpus ships enter&#39;s orbit, the Grineer will believe the Corpus have
            made a significant leap in controlling Orokin technology. That is all we need the cruiser for.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he sighs at the mention of Cetus</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;That is one aspect of our capture of Earth I am aware of. Operations with
            Ccetus will be temporarily shut down while we remove the Grineer presence on Earth. However, once we
            actually begin our Assault, the Grineer on the plains will likely shift their focus from Cetus to
            us.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he runs a hand over his face and sighs in exasperation before continuing</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;One thing I forgot to mention, is that we will be shutting down the Solar rails
            leading to Earth for the duration of our assault. Only after we remove the Grineer threat from Earth will we
            be reopening them. That ties into the question Kapak has. Once we reopen the Solar rails to Earth, all Tenno
            will be able to resume work with Cetus where they need it. But if they start causing trouble, the Solar
            rails will be shut down once more.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Mata then looks at Sigyn</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;You will remain with Dormin and Lyria wherever we secure them on the tower. If
            you would still like to be assigned to defense after we take the tower, you can assume command of the Solar
            Rails&#39; defense.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">turning to Isa, he asks her a question in return</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We could leave her on the surface of the planet and leave the bean device
            operational, but if the Corpus decide to send reinforcements, the Tenno that remain with Lyria may be tasked
            with defending two fronts. Corpus attakcers and Corrupted that find their way past the assault team and
            through the gate. if we bring her with us onto the tower, we can seal her and her defenders in a room with a
            single entrance and a secondary escape route while the rest of us clear the tower. I do not want to go after
            the bridge until the numbers of the Corrupted have been thinned to near extermination, or complete
            elimination. Having a Limbo on her guard detail could also be a potential plan, but we will discuss that
            course of action when we actually see how strong the Corrupted Presence is on the tower.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">turning to Zavis</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;You will lead the assault squadron on board the Corpus Carrier while you
            eliminate Drau&#39;s crew and direct his capture. As for taking a Corpus Battleship, I explained that
            reasoning in answering Kapak&#39;s question. The Drau will most likely be aboard a carrier. It is not
            guaranteed, but is highly likely. The Corpus will want extra units to help take over the Tower, and a
            carrier will provide them with the necessary forces to do so. In addition, I&#39;ve been infiltrating both
            Corpus and Grineer ships for the last thirty five years. If we sabotage the reactor with Coolant, it will
            effectively render the ship useless, while not destroying it. If we sabotaged it in any other way, it would
            indeed be on a countdown to destruction.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He finally looks to Cev</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We will begin the group sessions tomorrow. I strongly believe we will work well
            together as long as the chains of command are respected and followed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he pauses for a moment before continuing</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The missions we run tomorrow will work in tandem with each other. There are
            ever present Grineer and Corpus patrols and scavenging teams on Lua, and they need to be dealt with. We will
            run a mission tomorrow to eliminate several hostile squads that have been patrolling near here. That should
            give us the ability to practice our team synergy for when we assault the Corpus ships and the
            tower.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He crosses his arms behind his back once more</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;If you have any further questions you may ask them now, otherwise, you are
            dismissed.&quot;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c2" id="h.udf1r724qhsv"><span class="c0"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Dormin:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;It is not the question of morals, Shadowed One. I do not propose to you to
            create more. But internal defenses are necessary until we either create mechanical replacement or fill the
            tower with people fit for duty. Why? Because all that setup could suffer an intervention from Tenno of
            Lotus. Even though the possibility of that is little, its still exists. And if at any moment in time Lotus
            is to realize that some group of Tenno, that is not under her control, is trying to make such a move... We
            would have another bloodbath way to early for our current state of affairs. Neural Sentry and Corrupted
            could buy us time in such case. I beg you to reconsider, Shadowed One.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve also heard from our tardy friend Disruptis that he owns quite a stockpile
            of Specters we could also use.</span></p>

            It is : Rude... Blind to think all Tenno follow her like bees to a queen. We can always offer more, if the
            need arises.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Again, he nodded and gave a small chuckle, shrugging.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The Lotus cares for her Tenno... If we kill enough : They will stop coming. A

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot; I&#39;ll just come out and say it: I don&#39;t trust the Corrupted, not one
            bit. If we all have specters we could man the tower with, the place would be much better defended than if we
            relied on the corpses that are currently shuffling around in there. &nbsp;No offense to Dormin, but as it
            stands those things wouldn&#39;t be much more than cannon fodder to anyone the Lotus would send after
            us.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He then glares towards Lekalis, not at all liking what he&#39;s implying.</span>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;I don&#39;t much like the idea of turning our guns on other Tenno either,

            kill them...&quot; </span><span class="c1">He then crosses his arms and leans back in his seat, thinking

            his arms holding them. &nbsp;He was sitting in the leg space, with the top of his head popping over behind
            the seat infront of him. Perking his head, he spoke up now, in his quiet voice he tried to raise.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The... Corrupted are not to be trusted... They are like a hivemind... Like...
            Ants... They are bad. If we use them... Perhaps they could find a way... To escape... And if they do, it

            damage... Alliances made with us... If we&#39;re blamed for releasing them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Oro&#39;Kino continued to watch the other Tenno now, the upper half of his masked
            head the only visible part of him.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Unbeknownst to the inattentive participants, or rather, those who focused on the
            real important matter ahead, the door of the meeting room has remained opened until this point; the blonde
            girl has been waiting outside for the perfect moment to enter with the least amount of attention focused on
            her tardiness, and as soon as she notices the volume of questions and answers intensifying on the other
            side, she falls to the floor facing downwards, goes into void mode and begins shimmying her way through the
            opening frame and towards Kapak&#39;s appointed chair.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Once she reaches her target and raises to a sitting position on the ground behind

            the host&#39;s and attendee&#39;s field of view, and the significant mass of the Nidus next to her, has been
            rendered an unparalleled, unsupervised area of the room. She goes out of void mode and continues
            surreptitiously overhearing the opinions of the other Tenno with a smile on her face. The door has not
            closed either for some reason, therefore no visual announcement of her presence would have been made.</span>

            will give the carrier of the tray a light nod with a smile. He quickly stuffs one of the cookies in his
            mouth and twirls the second one in his hand as he starts chewing with his mouth full, like a savage. Garhul
            gives the twirling cookie a glance and let&rsquo;s out a quiet whine, nudging the seat upon which Devros
            sat. The boy gave his companion a glance through his busted glasses and shook his head. Everytime he gives
            Garhul something sweet he has diarrhea for two days&hellip;and he&rsquo;s not keen on having his kubrow shit
            around this sanctuary. Garhul let&rsquo;s out another silent whine and lowers it&rsquo;s ears in
            sadness.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Twirling his attention back to the discussion at hand he wrinkles his brows at the
            mention of the solar rails being shut down. He then shoots Lekalis a stare as the other spoke of killing
            other Tenno as if they were flies&hellip;that&rsquo;s absurd. Devros quickly swallows the cookie in his
            mouth and stands up to speak up, his formal speech out the window as a mixture of anger and passion emits
            from his face.</span></p>

            between his fingers like a coin. While he&rsquo;s not a fan of the Lotus and her ways he still holds
            sentiment for the Tenno that follow her. He&rsquo;s fought in missions with them, ate with them, travelled
            with them, explored with them, they have dreams, throughs, goals&hellip;they are more than just another body

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">At this point in time, Disruptis felt that he had enough information to get the
            gist of what was being considered and discussed. When Kapak mentioned his specters, he jolted upright. Those
            specters were all specially modified for specific use. Using them as grunts in a war would tear his heart.
            He gulped visibly at the prospect. The Tenno still had to consider it however, for they needed all the help
            they could get.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">he replied, leaning back in his chair and
            placing his feet onto the the empty seat in front of him,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ldquo;I do still
            have the place I made them in. It&rsquo;s only a small factory, but we could still use it to produce a

    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">He gratefully accepted some tea from Lekalis, giving him thanks. Anything that Loki

            along as Mataeru spoke the him, showing that his questions have been answered. The concerned look on his

    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">As the
            conversation starts to heat, he quietly, yet with very much intrigue observed the course it was taking, as
            he looked straight in the eyes of whoever was speaking, his amethyst gaze potentially giving chills to
            anyone who didn&rsquo;t know him. Vuko himself was unsure who was right, as everyone was raising very much
            valid arguments. It was a matter that concerned both how they, as a faction, will be viewed by others and
            how much of a militaristic advantage it will give them. Both of the problems were outside his scope, as he
            simply didn&rsquo;t care much for them nor was he trained in those aspects. Moral decisions were not for him
            to make, as he is but a soldier. He also</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c10 c13">trusts</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c1">that Mataeru will hear

            Lekalis&rsquo; plate of goodies finally made its way to him, he took one of the metal cups filled with tea
            and nodded the Loki as a thank you. After taking a few sips, he put the cup down on the table, eager to see

    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The questions went by her mind while her Banshee lowered its back to orangize the
            shattered delicacy off the floor. A soft feeling of melancholy washed over her, she was in fact very hungry,
            at least her tea was safe.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">She shook her head, both the frame&#39;s and her own in a vain attempt to break
            from its pain. The headache refused to dissipate.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">With what mentality wasn&#39;t taken up, was spent listening in on the

    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Isa:</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">A glimmer of disappointment appeared in Isa&#39;s eyes as Mataeru responded to
            her. Clearly he had not considered the third, far more reasonable option to taking her onto the tower or
            leaving her on the planet.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We have orbiters and landing craft. We leave her on one of those until
            we&#39;re ready to bring her onto the tower. There she will be safe, and not much time will be required to
            bring her to the gate. The likelihood of the Corpus reaching us with a large enough task force to be a
            threat on Earth, a Grineer stronghold, is minimal, especially given that those guarding the gate will have
            the chance to fortify their positions. Automated turrets can be set up to handle the Corrupted who pass
            through the gate. Alternatively we could deactivate it without destroying it until we no longer need
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Her gaze then fell upon Oro&#39;Kino and Muro, the corner of her lip twitched as
            she heard their views on the Corrupted... A glint of violent intent appeared in her eyes for a moment as she
            was tempted to bludgeon both of their heads for their sheer lack of understanding of the Corrupted. She
            spoke pointedly at them.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The Corrupted are drones controlled &nbsp;by the neural sentry. If our Sectarus
            gains control of the tower, she gains total control over them. The only reason for their aggression now is
            due to the fact that they are controlled by a cephalon that has degraded from the centuries it spent in the
            void. Not trusting them comes down to not trusting the one controlling them, and if we cannot trust this
            Sectarus, then the whole operation is a foolish endeavor.&quot;</span></p>

            class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;No need deciding how we get into the tower. This a multi-phase mission with variables
            that depend on the outcome of the previous phase. We can talk about how we get to the top of the tower and
            what not once we get to that part. It seems the first phase involves the infiltration team and that is not
            my specialty so I don&#39;t have an opinion for that phase. I will however...&quot; </span><span
            class="c1">He paused and turned his gaze back to Mata.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;Urge you to
            consider hijacking the carrier, or whatever vessel the scientist happens to use, instead of passing up that
            opportunity. Any other military vessel would likely be part of a fleet. If that was already part of the plan
            and coolant sabotage can be undone to make the vessel usable, then I don&#39;t believe I have anything
            else..&quot; </span><span class="c3 c1">and with that he sits down and waits for this to be over.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c8 c6">Cev:</span></p>

            the others speak. He stared up at the ceiling as he spoke,</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Personally, I would have to disagree about the corrupted. It doesn&rsquo;t
            make much sense to throw out a possible tool even if we decide not to use it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He lurched forward, jumping to his feet before leaning on the back of
            Disruptis&rsquo; chair.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But hey you&rsquo;re the boss so just point me where I&rsquo;m needed

    <h2 class="c11" id="h.84fwtlqjibbg"><span class="c8 c6">Mataeru:</span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he looks at Dormin and shakes his head</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;It is a question of morals. If we are willing to use whatever means necessary
            to achieve our goals, what kind of light does that put us in? What would the people we are trying to protect
            think of us? There is also the chance that the Corrupted could resist Lyria&#39;s control. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he then looks to Kapak</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I appreciate the concern with our numbers, but being good has always been the
            harder of the two roles. We will not be walking a line between good and less good. We will be firmly planted
            on one side, and remain there. However, using Warframe specters as temporary crew is something I had not
            considered. Several specters will be more useful to us than a tower full of Corrupted. Although, they will
            not come cheap. So we will 0nly need enough for security and basic maintinence until we can fill the tower
            with a more intelligent crew. As for defending Lyria, if you would prefer to remain with her and her
            security detail, you may. We finally have an additional Vazarin Tenno, so we can spare the
            power.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He then turns to address the words the Strider put forth</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;He is right. After losing several squadrons of Tenno to my blade in the halls
            outside, she stopped sending them to investigate. It will take a significant amount of effort on our part,
            but if she insists on fighting us, she will have to learn that she is fighting on the wrong side. And I am
            confident her forces will start to turn on her when they see the progress we make.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">turning to Muro, he replies</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;If you have spare resources hidden away somewhere, we will need them. I have a
            significant cache myself, and if we all combine out resources, we can deploy a specter force to the tower
            once we clear it. I to wish there was another way to ward the Lotus&#39; Tenno off without killing them, but
            unless they switch sides willingly we will have to fight them. However, keep in mind, unless we confront the
            Tenno themselves, we will merely be killing Warframes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">He looks to Orokino and nods</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Your observation is one of the reasons I refuse to use them. Especially the
            part about wounding alliances. Assuming the people we align ourselves with do not take offense at our use of
            the Corrupted.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">his attention immediately snaps to Kapak again</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Kuve. You are dreadfully late. I will send you a copy of everything that has
            transpired in the meeting up to this point. If you are late for the next mission briefing, you will be
            grounded to Sanctuary until the next mission.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">His gaze shifts to Devros</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;If you would like to volunteer for this infiltration mission you will need to
            sit out the assault on the tower. It would provide us with valuable intelligence however. In regard to the
            Solar Rail, we have to take them offline for each planet we decide to take. There is no way around it. If we
            do not slow the incoming approach of hostile ships, we will be quickly overwhelmed. At Mar&#39;s closest
            point to Earth with the Grineer ships travelling at maximum speed, it will take them fifty two days to reach
            Earth without a Solar rail, and the same goes for the Corpus and Tenno. That time is
            invaluable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Mata&#39;s focus shifts to Disruptis, his eyes narrowing and his body visibly
            stiffening at the Tenno kicking his feet up on the chair in front</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We will likely need to dip into your Specter reserves, but we will not drain it
            completely.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">he then makes a quick gesture to the Tenno to get his feet off the chair</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning to Isa, Mata addresses her concerns</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The dig site is not on a remote world. the Corpus will have additional
            garrisons on the planet where they uncover the gate. Once they lose contact with the Dig site, they will
            quite likely mobilize their forces and attempt to secure the site. Bringing Lyria onto the tower with us has
            it&#39;s positives and negatives. All it would take is an abush by a Corrupted Nullifier and she could be
            killed. Waiting until we secure the tower to bring her aboard could give the Corpus time to resecure the
            other side of the gate. We may end up leaving Disruptis and Sigyn with Dormin to defend Lyria in a secure

    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&quot;If the coolant leaks and reactor can be repaired in a moderate time, then we

            will likely not function again.&quot;</span></p>

            heading out as the meeting appears to be coming to an end. That is until he hears his name among people that
            aren&#39;t dismissed. He stopped in his tracks, releasing a heavy sigh and slumping down his shoulders
            before looking around thinking to himself &#39;So that&#39;s the Corpus Scientist...&#39; he said looking at
            Isa and then turns to Kuve &#39;I know Kuve...&#39; and then looks around &#39;Who&#39;s the other one with

            with the chair. Once standing, she dusts her posterior and leans on the piece of furniture before she begins
            scanning the room for that individual whose name she had never heard before, and deducing it to belong to
            the somber lady with a Vahd outfit whose body motion does not indicate she is leaving. Kuve does not hold
            back her disapproval towards the latter&#39;s outfit and displayed colours, and in fact diverts her sight

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;The ship could be repaired from a coolant breach in theory. In practice this
            is... less than ideal. Even if this form of sabotage does not tend to outright destroy the ship, it causes
            enough damage to the structure and systems throughout it that going through everything to assess and repair
            all of the damage generally winds up more costly than simply scrapping it and building a new

            will prove quite useful for this mission. I would like you to procure a Corpus transport and set of clothes
            that a pilot or trooper would wear and bring them to Sanctuary. When we locate Drau&#39;s vessel, I would
            like you covertly sneak the assault team on board the carrier with the transport and then blend in with the
            crew and locate Drau, relating his location to the assault team while also mapping out his potential escape
            routes and sabotaging the escape methods he would attempt to use. Are capable of and are you willing to
            performing these tasks?&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Zavis, I want you to lead the assault squad on the Corpus carrier to capture
            Drau. You and I both know I do not possess good frontline combat skills, whereas you are better suited to
            that than I. Are you okay with this?&quot;</span></p>

            then his mind wanders when Mata get&#39;s to Isa. He snaps out of it when Mata says his name and looks over
            with a questioning hum. When asked if he&#39;s okay with this, he lets out a heavy sigh and raises a
            finger</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&quot;So, let me get this straight.&quot; </span><span class="c1">he

            cookies coquettishly, batting her eyes every once in a while. The playful stroller does not wait long before
            she stops next to Lekalis, and elbows him while expressing her intention.</span><span

            hand, his body still slightly shaking from consuming the drink. A smile threatened to escape his lips as he
            witnessed the exchange between the Loki and sly blonde.</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;You will. As long as you remmeber your training from before, you will not find
            it hard to adjust to fighting the Corpus. Although there are some here on Lua if you wish to try your hand
            at fighting them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">his attention shifts to Isa</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;It might be best for you to hijack one of the supply ships on Pluto&#39;s
            surface get aboard that way, which is basically what you suggested. Once we find the location of his
            carrier, we will know where it is being supplied. If you can successfully steal one the cargo ships, you can
            smuggle our forces on board inside sealed containers. Just give us the signal after you find Drau and the
            rest of the plan will fall into place.&quot;</span></p>
