The anonymous distress that led you all here seemed to be coming from the hangar of one of the ships toward the edge of the cluster, a smaller one mostly untouched by the Technocyte. The interior of the hangar seems just as untouched by it, with just a couple of small growths here and there. The hangar does look rather dillapidated, and probably hasn&#39;t been used in a few years. There is no sign of anyone being here since this ship was abandoned. No sign of any sort of distress call coming from here. Off in the distance, the growling of Infested can be heard, but that&#39;s nothing to be concerned about. Probably. For now, at least.~</span>

The ship itself is small in craft, something akin to a Orbiter but of simple Corpus design and smaller in size. Dull white colors adorn it’s hull, accompanied by equally pale blue lines that drag out from the front to the back, marking it as if a huge beast clawed it down.~

<strong>???</strong>
Finally, after all that mulling, scanning and thinking over, the craft dispatches a beat down Liset that slowly approaches the hangar of the least infested out of the brigade. With a hiss of air it enters the ships landing area, dropping down as gently as possible. The craft opens up and from it steps forth a very tall figure (1.86m) all dressed in dark traditional Arbiters robes and a dark blue colored cloak, his head wrapped in old bandages apart from a slit for his white eyes. There is a Silva &amp; Aegis resting on his right arm and a single Viber by his left hip, along with a variety of gear items all lined up along his belt.

A buzz rings out as his comms trigger “Are you sure about this?” A soft concerned voice speaks through

“Keep a eye on the scans.”

The figure replies in a commanding, muffled and robotic tone, not leaving room for any more discussion. He grabs on to his scanner and silently starts walking deeper in the interior, every sense on his body on high alert. He eyes the infested growths but mostly watches for any movement or indication of anyone still living – or not mutated.</span>

It doesn&#39;t take long for a yet <em>more</em> shabby-looking mantis to make its way towards the cluster of infested ships, heading for the same hangar that the Liset had touched down in.

<strong>???</strong>
&quot;Vilkas, looks like someone made it in here before us. Here&#39;s hoping they know what to expect, because I have a feeling I know who&#39;s here...&quot; muttered a voice as a similarly beat-up white and orange chroma stepped forward and readied a matching ignis. &quot;Keep an eye out for you-know-who, yeah?&quot;
&quot;Of course, operator,&quot; chirped his cephalon, &quot;just don&#39;t go dragging home any strays this time, please?&quot;

With a grunt of acknowledgement, the chroma started forward into the depths of the ship, lighting the way with a combination of lights on his helmet and ignis, as well as the glow from the brownish-white energy throughout his frame. He hoped he could find the source of the distress signal before something went wrong...</span>

~The noise of Infested in the distance went quiet as the two Tenno disembarked. The air smelled of decay and various coolants, mixed together into a generally unpleasent scent. There was absolutely no movement to be seen right now. The main door on the other side of the hangar was open, likely leading further into this ship.

“Heads up, you have company” Came the same calm voice through and the figure stopped his advance to turn towards the entrance area of the hangar, looking over his shoulder like he’s been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

“Friendly?” He mumbles out in his muffled speech.

“Well it’s not Grineer, nor Corpus…a Tenno perhaps…thought they can be hostile too”

The figure turns around, completely facing the approaching Mantis with both hands held behind his back. He stands firm with a straight posture, like a soldier waiting his commander in the lineup. White, ghostly eyes follow the dropdown and he watches as the Chroma steps out and that intimidating ignis. The figure throws his arms up, to show no hostility towards the approaching Tenno.

“Greetings”

He starts saying in his bandage muffled and very raspy voice (batman!) Offering a small bow towards the warframe at the end, complete with the head and cupped fists gesture.

“Investigating or…?”

He eyes the Chroma, trying to spot any indication of hostility in his movement and action</span>

The chroma eyes him suspiciously. At first, a layer of ice formed over the frame, but it dissipated when the figure held his hands up. “Don’t worry, I won’t toast you unless you make the first move. You could say I’m investigating, yeah. I could ask the same of you. I’m expecting more powerful infestation here than usual, so I hope you’re prepared.”

“My name’s Leveret, by the way. What should I call you?” He asks, not returning the bow.</span>

The exterior of the ship was dented and warped, almost as if a massive hand had squished the metal hull in an giant grip before reshaping it back into its original form. Its paint job was faded, scratched, and flaking away, its original designs barely distinguishable against the uneven, asymmetrical bulges in the steel plates.
The interior of the Landing Craft was just as bad, if not worse than the exterior. The walls were coated in strands of silk-like infestation, their ends snaking in and out of holes punched through the walls by the ravenous growths. The metal walls shared the same warped, misshapen features of the outside, and the atmosphere within the cabin was filled with orange spores that lingered hauntingly, like fiery snowflakes on a windless day.
&quot;It&#39;s been what, 4 years since I&#39;ve been here?&quot; Kapak asked, to no one in particular. His &#39;cephalon,&#39; if you could call it that, remained quiet. It only spoke when spoken directly to, and kapak was mostly talking to himself to ease his nervous mind. &quot;I hope Plaguewatch has moved the void out of here since then. Isn&#39;t anywhere else we can go to get what we need though, is there?&quot;
The ship creaked and groaned in response, sweat dripping from the muscular flesh that adorned the ceiling as the ship maneuvered around wreckage. Kapak paused though as a blip showed up on the ship&#39;s half-infested nav console.
&quot;A distress signal? Hmm. Probably just a technocyte colony that found a way to activate the beacon to lure travellers to their doom. Classic predatory move.&quot;
Kapak remained quiet for a moment as the ship began to pass by the distress signal before he slammed his hand onto the powerless codex module. &quot;FINE! OKAY!! WE&#39;LL CHECK IT OUT!!&quot; He slapped the surface again before pouting, arms crossed, his outburst directed at literally nothing.

The large Nidus just managed to squeeze himself through the Warframe deployment pod, popping loose and drifting through space until he reached the hull just above the hangar. He ripped open a servicing vault and pulled himself inside, working his way through the dark maintenance tunnel before finally plopping out onto a catwalk just above the previous two Tenno who had arrived.

The figure relaxes his posture and once again clasps his hands behind his back, not to reach something but cause it’s like his resting stance. A low nod is what he offers at first to the others words finding solace in the fact that he’s not gonna  get roasted anytime soon. Honestly, the amount of times he’d like that to be more true is ridiculous.

“Then we are dragged by the same goal. Ran in to a cluster like this a couple of years back and hoping I’m not too late” He looks to the side, glancing at the wiggling infestation with a flat stare, at the grasping tendrils “…for some at least”

He snaps his white eyes back to the Chroma and eyes him from head to toe, evaluating the level of trust he should give him. On one hand he’s a Tenno, a child his order reveres as limitless wells of divinity. On the other, he’s run in to far too many of them that do not care for morals. But, this one doesn’t feel like the heartless ones.

The Arbiter robed man lifts his right hand to touch his chest with a opened palm and says in his bandage muffled voice

“It’s a pleasure to meet you Leveret, You can call me Etaler” He once again bows to the Chroma but this time just with his head which might look like a deep nod.

“Looks like we’ll be working together then…” He pauses as he hears something in the distance. The bandaged figure turns his head to the left and narrows his pale eyes to try and spot something moving in the darkness, but it looks like it was the infested wind (<em>Skyrim guard logic intensifies</em>)

He then looks back at the Chroma and steps to the side, gesturing with his hand that the frame can walk alongside him if he so wished.

“Let’s see if we can find the source of the signal then”

He will then whip out his scanner once more and start walking towards the only exit door in the hangar.</span>

“Etaler. Got it.” He says, nodding once and forgoing all formalities. Leveret’s gruffness causes him to miss the noise entirely as he instinctively takes the lead, ignis at the ready.

Leveret stays mostly silent as they walk, seeming to be deep in thought. He sometimes pauses to point his ignis at dark corners, checking for reaching tendrils and spore pods ready to burst. He didn’t trust the wrappings over Etaler’s face to protect him from the infestation, though he doesn’t say it out loud.

~The hangar has gone eerily silent. The lights in the hangar flickered once, and dimmed slightly. The smell of rotting flesh and coolant still permeated everything.~
<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~There was a creaking under Kapak, as the catwalk he stood on began to gave away. In the dead silence of the room, this noise would almost certainly draw attention to his presence. It creaked again under his weight, and he would likely know it was a moment away from collapse.~
<strong>LEVERET</strong>
~This was almost certainly the place. These were around the coordinates the two had been in when they had made contact with Leveret last. It would certainly make sense that they would check here, of all places. It was a hub of Infested, and perfect for <em>his</em> purposes. That wouldn&#39;t explain the distress call, though.

<em>Oh VOID.</em> Kapak swore silently as he rolled sideways into a corner of the room, still remaining on the upper level, hoping to stay out of sight. The catwalk however, wobbled angrily as he moved off of it, relieved from the weight of the above-average-sized Nidus.
It also didn&#39;t help that the catwalk then proceeded to break and fall to the floor of the hangar with a resounding clang; its supports must have been too eroded from the Infestation.</span>

The loud bang quickly froze the draped man. He quickly whirled around with his Viper in hand and at the ready, aiming at the darkness. However, he sees nothing, apart from the crumbled metal that broke off from the top.

“Hm…”

He hummed under his bandages as he lifts his scanner with his other hand and takes a look through it, to see if there is in fact something squirming in the blackness or if the fall was caused cause of corrosion. Etaler is not a man that likes to take chances and coincidences does not happen as much as people think. Pointing it towards the catwalk he doesn’t seem to catch any readings, maybe due to the fact that the Nidus scurried to the farthest corner and out of the scanners range. Etaler lowers it and looks towards the Chroma

“Looks like it was the corrosion”

He then turns around and walks out of the hangar, keeping his scanner in front of his eyes with his right hand and his viper in his left one. If there are any heat signatures out there, he will pick them up…if they are within a 20m range.</span>

This time, it was loud enough to attract his attention, and Leveret whipped around to face the source of the noise, his helmet light following his gaze as he searched for the source of the noise. It flicked over the maroon pustules covering the walls, seeing only infestation. &quot;...You&#39;re right. Nothing here but your standard sticky grossness. We better get moving before stuff starts grabbing our ankles.&quot;

Leveret followed Etaler closely, now even more on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary. Again he instinctively took the lead, shining the light on his ignis left, right, left, scanning for movement as they walked, passing throbbing boils and dripping sores on the walls. &quot;Ghh.

~After the clatter of the catwalk hitting the ground, everything went silent again. Not so much as a growl from a distant infested. The earlier growls and shrieks were nowhere to be heard.~

<em><strong>LEVERET AND ETALER</strong></em>
~The scanner didn&#39;t pick up any Infested targets mearby. Beyond the hangar, the Infested growths grew in density by a huge amount. They covered the ceilings, walls, and floors, some growths dangling down. The smell of coolant was soon replaced by the stench of decay, even stronger in here. The hallway itself looked seriously messed up, some scorch marks from weapons visible on exposed metal, and covering a few of the growths. Some sort of struggle had happened here fairly recently.~

<em><strong>KAPAK</strong></em>
~The other two had left Kapak in the hangar, clearly not noticing him as the advanced into the corridor. This behavior seen so far was extremely uncommon for Infested, as they would normally have come charging in the moment they heard a noise. Something was wrong here.~</span>

He walked a few steps behind the Chroma, if he wants to take the lead then Etaler has no qualms about that. In fact, It might be better cause so far he sees no sign of any lifeforms with his scanner and that usually means that if there are any infested around that they are huddled up in a room somewhere, a room with the freshest death. His pale eyes glance towards the growing infestation, his steps far lighter and careful than before not wanting to step on any gas mines or pop any of the cists.

He says nothing back to the Chroma’s retort about the infested, apart from a slight nod of his head that he heard and agrees with him.

His eyes catch the marks on the wall, bellow the pulsating flesh. Etaler holsters his viper and pouches the scanner before walking over to the marks to run a palm through it. Fresh scorch residue smears across his hand, causing the bandaged man to frown.

“It’s fresh…but…no infested…this is troubling”

He mutters to himself out loud and continues walking after the Chroma.

“Either they all killed each other or something is off”

He speaks up in his muffled but raspy voice, whipping out the scanner once more.</span>

Every scorch mark, every sign of struggle, made Leveret more antsy to keep moving, but he forced himself to wait and let Etaler investigate. “I know. We should be getting mobbed by now...I don’t see any bodies, though. There could be survivors. I....I hope there are survivors. I have friends on this ship.”

“Trust me, the fact that something is off should be expected. Like I said, this strain is different. More mucked up than usual.”

Leveret fell silent, remembering his time on Europa. He shivered slightly, from the memory of both the cold and what had happened there. <em>At least I’m more prepared this time...</em> he thought, trying to reassure himself.</span>

The Nidus let out a sigh of relief as his company left the room. He dropped onto the main floor as silently as possible before inhaling with his mouth.
The Infestation communicated telephathically using airborne pheromones... if there were some, Kapak would be able to “hear” them by smelling them. 
It had always been strange for Kapak, being among the hives and fleshpits of other technocyte strains. But it had never scared him. If anything, he felt safer when up against the Infested than the Grineer and Corpus.</span>

~There were certainly Infested in the area, but they seemed to be awfully non-agressive.  They were keeping their distance from the two who had just left the hangar, which was the polar opposite to what they would normally be doing. Something was strange here.~

~The floor creaked under the two intruders, weakened by likely years of corrosion and disrepair. It didn&#39;t sound like it would collapse, but it made quite a bit of noise. Down the corridor, most doors they passed were either grown over by Infested or simply broken. It branched off in many places, likely leading further into this twisted Infested maze.~</span>

“Is is it just me or does this <em>scream</em> trap to you?” Leveret muttered, eyeing a cyst as they passed it on their way deeper into the ship. “Everything seems...benign. We aren’t being mobbed even with all the noise we’re making.”

He sighed, adjusting his grip on his ignis. “If it’s alright with you, I’m just going to stomp right into the center of this possible trap and get it over with. How’s that sound?”</span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">“Trust me, the fact that something is off should be expected. Like I said, this strain is different. More mucked up than usual.”</div>

The bandaged man takes a double take at the Chroma’s words, his head twitching. He knows what’s going on?! Etaler was stumped for a moment, sure he was just as much of a stranger as the Chroma is to him but that’s one piece of information you would like to hear up front.

“So you’ve been hunting it for a while?”

He stops just as the Chroma did and inspects the surrounding area with his scanner but just as before nothing of significance pops up on it which makes the bandages man feel a bit uneasy. Here he is, in the middle of a infested brigade and no infested in sight. If this is a special strain like the Tenno says than that could mean that these monstrosities are better organized…or all under one rule…which is not so impossible.

He looks at the Chroma and then to the forked road and then behind him. If they do charge at them they will get surrounded real fast and Etaler is not a man of brash decisions. He turns his pale eyes towards the Tenno and shakes his head, his voice low and muffled by the bandages but sounding firm.

“No, It might trigger something we can’t handle. I would like to get more info of this situation before summoning a hoard”

He will nod at the Tenno to cement his words and look back at the road ahead, taking the corridor to the far left. However, if the other is so set on his actions Etaler won’t have anything against it, he just hopes the Chroma will be able to take care of it himself cause he’s taking no part In half-through out strategies.</span>

&quot;Ah, yeah, you could say that. It very nearly got personal a couple of times. It&#39;s really starting to piss me off.&quot;

He went silent after Etaler made his second point. Eventually, a puff of mist emerged from the front of his helmet on both sides as he sighed. &quot;You&#39;re right. I can handle myself but avoiding a fight with Big Ugly is probably for the best if other people are involved.&quot;

Another pause. <em>I should probably warn him...</em> he realized. &quot;Also. I should ask you....have you ever fought Tenno before?&quot;</span>

<em>The void...? They&#39;re avoiding us... seems like whatever hivemind has dominion over this territory has developed a higher level of intelligence to display non-aggressive immediate response...</em> Kapak speculated.
He continued to scan the room in the dim light, observing anything he could be moving down the hallway the previous two had left down. If anything was going to happen around here, it would probably be around them.
There was a light thud behind him, several magenta spots glowing in the darkness.
&quot;Aw, Razogoth.&quot; Kapak cracked a smile at his smallest and yet most ferocious and loyal Charger. &quot;Didn&#39;t want to leave me alone, huh, girl?&quot; He gave the creature a quick scratch. &quot;I didn&#39;t even realize you snuck aboard my landing craft. Did you sneak in behind me?&quot;
The infested hound sheepishly gurgled.
&quot;Heh. Well, I&#39;ll welcome your help, gal Although Yrogeth&#39;s two heads might have been more useful for sniffing out whatever the void&#39;s going on here. Now, stay low and quiet.&quot; Kapak and his Charger crept forward through the hall as silently as possible.</span>

~The long, Infested-filled hallway continued for a long time, the lights along the corridor flickering. There seemed to be blast marks around here again, a sure sign of some sort of recent struggle of some kind here. Normally, the Infested would just regrow. Someome else had been here recently, or they were still here. They couldn&#39;t have been created by the original crew, seeing as these ships have been abandoned for a long time.~

<strong>KAPAK AND INFESTED DOGGO</strong>
~There is definitely something wrong with this place. The Infested are never docile. They were essentially animals, after all. All they desired was food, and they protected their territory. But not this time. The hallway became more and more filled with an assortment of Infested growths, spreading across every surface like tendrils. The blast marks on the growths means that some sort of struggle happened here recently. Where else could they have come from?~</span>

One of his brows traveled up, not that it can be seen apart from one of his eyes slightly widening from the motion. So he’s been following the strand for a while eh? Well at least that means that he must know what’s waiting around corners…or well WHY there aren’t things around corners. He wanted to ask the reason as to why this Tenno is so dead set on hunting this infestation but he decides against it, as it is probably a personal question and Etaler isn’t a fan of making friends if he’s only seen them once. It’s a vast universe so if you bump in to someone a second time then you can bet your oxium that it’s something like fate.

For the  time being he walks along with the Chroma, keeping silent and eying the area through his scanner, trying to catch anything suspicious that might jump out at them.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">&quot;Also. I should ask you....have you ever fought Tenno before?&quot;</div>

He glances at the Chroma from the corner of his vision and let’s a second of silence pass as his mind races with thoughts. Will he attack him now? Asking cause he knows what’s ahead? Just chit-chatting? All possibilities. After the short silent pause, the dark robed man simply said.

“I have. Mostly Veil helpers”

He pauses, his eyes staying on the Tenno and waits to see if the other explains himself as to why ask such a question in the first place.</span>

&quot;Good. You might have to fight some more Tenno if this goes as expected. Well...sort of. Like I said, this strain is messed up....&quot;
He trailed off, his attention again drawn to the scorch marks. He wasn&#39;t as familiar with corpus weapons, so he couldn&#39;t tell what kinds had left these marks, nor could he figure out how many people had made them. <em>Please be two people. Please be two people. </em>

On one hand, he wished the infested would get off their slimy asses and come attack already, but he reminded himself that it was more than likely there&#39;s worse things than runners on the ship. Grumpily, he began to pick up his pace slightly as they continued down the hall.</span>

“Wonder if I can access some photoreceptive memory,” Kapak said, sticking his fingers into a node of tendrils. This was essentially a purely organic form of hacking into security camera footage, although even if there was anything to be seen, it would be nowhere near the level of clarity as a security camera.
“Come on, come on,” Kapak whispered with anticipation, eager and hopeful that some of the technocyte in the area had grown some form of an eyespot. If he could get any clue as to what had happened here, it would be beneficial.

⇝Razogoth:
The petite Helminth Charger sniffed the floor nearby, recoiling at the scent of the scorched surfaces. She had an even stronger sense of smell than Kapak, and might be able to detect the scent of other things... or people, who had been here.</span>

~The two of them reach a larger, mostly empty room, with three other corridors branching off. There seems to be a particularly dense Infested growth here, and it may impede movement on the ground slightly. However, everything seems still. Then, on the scanner, a single moving dot appeared. Then two. Then three. And just as the third appeared, without warning, blast doors shut, closing off all four exits from the room. Everything was dead silent now, even more so than before. And then, from above, they hear a low growl, coming from a couple of Infested in the vents. And then, again without warning, the scanner was filled with dots. Absolutely flooded with them. Another low growl was heard, this time louder, followed immediately by an ear-piercing screech and the sounds of many, many footsteps. This was a trap.~

<strong>KAPAK AND INFESTED DOGGO</strong>
~Kapak was in luck. He found somewhere he could see, quite a bit further down the corridor they were currently in. Even with a lack of clarity, he could see what appeared to be two Corpus crewmen, desperately running for their lives, blind-firing Tetras behind them as they dashed away from a mob of Infested creatures. There were no real distinguishing features beyond the uniforms and the guns. Oddly, they seemed to be trying to run further into the ship. They eventually ran out of sight, chased by a mob. This had been mere hours ago.~
~Razogoth would be able to verify that people had indeed been here, and took the same path that Kapak saw. There had also indeed been a sizable mob following the two. It was unclear if they were currently alive or not.~
~Suddenly, both of them are interrupted by the sounds of blast doors slamming shut, followed by a barely audible shriek in the distance. The Infested suddenly became violent, and seemed to be going after the Tenno and the Hexis operative.~</span>

Simply nodded to his companion at the mention of them fighting a Tenno. Etaler is a experienced man and has been through many situations so a brawl with a wayward star child is not something he’s new to. He continued to follow the hallway, watching every step he takes so to not stir the infestation too much. However, then:

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">BEEP</div>

A red dot shows up on his scanner and he quickly halts his movement, reaching out to grab the Chroma with his free hand so to halt him as well 

“Movement, fast”

He quietly murmurs to the Tenno though his bandages. Then:

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">BEEP BEEP BEEP</div>

I lift my head from the scanner to try and spot them but then out of warning the blast doors shut and Etaler steels himself. Well dang it…it was a trap.

“Blessed be”

He whispers under his breath. Still, Etaler is pretty sure that even if the Chroma stirred the pot that they still wouldn’t budge…this is all too well organized. 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">BEEP BEPP BEPP BEPP BEPP BEPP BEPP BEPP BEPP</div>

He looks back at his scanner as it flares up with redness. Etaler let’s out a frustrated growl and pockets the scanner, whipping out his flaming Silva &amp; Aegis, the fire casting a light in the darkness. The growls and screams did little to unnerve him but he could feel slight panic rising up from his gut. It’s never pleasant being in a trap. Etaler will turn towards the Tenno and with a quick serious tone, says

“Back to back”

He will then, if the Tenno agrees, press his back against the much taller figure, hoping this way they would stay out of each others fire (quite literally) and offer some sort of a safe spot in the oncoming swarm. Lifting his shield to cover most of his front, he readies his sword and patiently waits for visual contact.</span>

&quot;Rahm. Called it,&quot; the chroma muttered, having already readied his ignis to start torching a clear path. As soon as Etaler alerted him to the movement, a puff of cold air emerged from the front of his helmet and a layer of ice hardened around both of them. With his vex armor also ready, he moved back to back with Etaler and lifted his Ignis in preparation to roast any infested he saw. &quot;COME AT ME, YOU SLIMY FREAKS!

He found himself looking forward to messing up a horde of infested, as payback for what he&#39;d been through recently.</span>

“Void-damn,” Kapak whispered, smelling the air full with testosterone as the aggression levels of the Infested grew.
“Those fools are dead in the water in this place,” Kapak muttered to himself as he strode towards the blast doors, his long legs carrying him there in an instant. He forced his fingers into the crack between the two halves of the door and pulled, straining his mutant muscles to their limit to tear open the door.
“Errrgghhhh.... Helminth.... kill the.... lights...” he groaned as the door began to creak and bend. “I’d rather... not be seen... just... yet...”
It was true. Kapak didn’t exactly want to make it known that he was there- he was still an extremely wanted criminal. But he couldn’t just let the technocyte monsters here tear the two to shreds.
The lights behind him flickered off as an air support charge knocked out the the power to what few, dim, flickering lights were left in that hallway.
“Oof,” he grunted as he let go of the doors. “Alright, a little heavier than I thought,” he said, eying the now dented door.  He thrust his palm out as a creature squeezed through a sphincter in his palm, latching onto the door with a few small tentacles. Other tentacles grabbed the surrounding infested growths, sapping them of their nutrients and bolstering its own strength until it began to wrench the door open with ease.
Kapak pulled the weapon from his back and loaded a case of fleshy, poisonous shells into it- a Torid.</span>

~They&#39;re coming from every direction, by the look of it. They&#39;re pouring in through vents on the ceiling, and charging in through previously hidden gaps in the floor. There was a truly absurd amount of them coming in right now, seeing as there were easily a hundred of them already. Additionally, some of the ones coming in through the ceiling are dropping directly on the two of them.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~With the door open, Kapak could see the absolutely massive horde attacking from every direction, and the Tenno and Hexis operative standing back to back. Not only was it strange for the Infested to wait so long before attacking, it also seemed absurd that one of them closed the blast doors. There was very clearly something odd about these Infested. Unfortunately, once Kapak got the door open, several broke off from the horde to attack him, charging forward at full speed.</span>

As soon as the infested appeared, Leveret pulled the trigger on his ignis, not letting go for any reason other than reloading, spewing flames on everything in his field of view. Any toxin that made it past his fiery onslaught only served to make the flames stronger. He heard the creaking of the door behind him but couldn&#39;t risk turning around.
&quot;They&#39;re breaking through the blast door!&quot; he yelled to Etaler, grabbing a crawler off his back and chucking it into a wall. &quot;Should we fall back to the hangar and bottleneck them in the hall?&quot;

Leveret paused to reload, stomping on a downed charger. &quot;This isn&#39;t even the worst we&#39;re going to encounter, probably. It&#39;s just- &quot; he bashed a runner away &quot;-pure numbers at this point.&quot;</span>

No matter how many times you look at a hoard of infested, you still feel your heart beating against your chest as if it’s about to fly out. Etaler tries to stay calm as they bust through, from all sides and just mindlessly charged at them. As soon as one of them jumped in to the bandaged man’s vision he swings his flaming sword to half the first charger. In a instant, he went in to a sort of pattern. He lifts his burning shield up to cover his front and bash forward, to push the swarm back a bit so that he has a clear cut of the nearest infested before bringing the shield back up again for safety and to scorch any foolish enough to come too close to him. (SPARTANS) Rinse and repeat, like a well oiled machine. Shield bash – stab – cover – shield bash…

He feels a crawler fall on top if him and he clenches his teeth in annoyance, quickly lifting his sword to stabs it, which probably reached through to the Chroma’s solid back, the Tenno probably felt a light burning sting. He flings the limp crawler from his sword to the side as he shield bashes another charge and reaches out to decapitate a enemy.

Even when the lights went totally dead he continued his technique but when he heard the door that they came through open, he shortly glances towards it and notices some of the infested switching targets and charging at a shadow in the hallway. Reinforcements? Survivors? Who is it? The white eyed man couldn’t make it out in the second he took to glance at that direction and instead focused back on his current task of staying alive. Through gritted teeth, he muffles out to the Chroma, hoping he could hear him through the screaming and screeching.

“No, the moment we break backs they will pull us. You-“ Shield bash

“-will make it” Stab

“But I’m not sure I will” Cover, pant.

“Let’s just hope-“ Shield bash

“-that there is a-” Stab, wheeze.

“-end to this-“ Cover</span>

However if they do continue to charge then he will have no choice but to throw out his ace which will cause momentary peace but will sure unleash hell after.</span>

Within a flash, the dainty looking Helminth Charger had torn through one of other Chargers and was pouncing upon the Runner adjacent to it.

“Just gotta fire off a few of these,” he grimaced, pulling the trigger of the grenade launcher and sending 3 slimy bombs into the thick of the swarm. They exploded, spreading a thick layer of poisonous mist across the rooms and halls that which the monsters poured from.
“AHAHAHA!” Kapak roared with excitement, “DIE, FATHERMUCKERS, DIE!” Grenade after grenade flew out into the crowds of seething monsters, all while Razogoth fended off the few Infested who moved their way.</span>

~The Infested just keep coming, charging recklessly at Leveret and Etaler. No matter how many of their numbers fall, more run over the corpses of their fallen brethren. Even worse, some of them appear to be using the corpses as shields to protect them from the flames, allowing them to get closer and closer over time. This was quickly becoming a war of attrition.
Suddenly, completely without warning, a kunai, aimed at Leveret&#39;s head, seemingly comes out of nowhere. Well, <em>that</em> certainly complicated things.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~More and more Infested are now breaking off from the horde to go after Kapak. They began moving around the blast radius of the grenades, and spread out to minimize potential casualties. This was a strange amount of strategic movement coming from the Infested, of all things. Something about them was different. Between the non-agressive behavior, this trap, and their movement patterns, they somehow seemed to be showing intelligence.~</span>

Slowly being overwhelmed by infestation, Leveret continued to punt away as many infested as he could, his finger starting to ache from pulling the trigger on his ignis so desperately. His elemental ward of ice was slowly melting away, and he was preparing to refresh it when he felt a ping of metal on his helmet. He saw a metallic flash among the spores as a kunai bounced off his icy armor.
&quot;RAHM! Big Ugly&#39;s here! He&#39;s cloaked!&quot; Leveret called to Etaler, looking desperately for a Loki-shaped gap in infested and spores as he pushed a runner off of himself.

&quot;Ugh! I&#39;m tired of this!&quot; he yelled, ducking to the ground as his heavy pelt freed itself from his back and let loose a room-shaking roar. Without giving the infested time to recover, the floating sentry released a blast of cold, refreshing their layer of ice armor and severely dropping the temperature of the room. &quot;I was hoping to save that for later...&quot; he grumbled as he waited for the onslaught to start again.</span>

<em>”Damn it, there is no end to this</em>”

The man thought as he stabbed yet another infested, the bodies pooling by his feet only aiding his enemy, helping them during the bash stage of his attack. Then he heard a metallic ping and he twitched his head to look over his shoulder to the Chroma behind him just as the kunai bounced off. Big Ugly? Who’s that? Etaler chose not to discuss that right now but he certainly hopes that it isn’t a kunai throwing mutation out there, that would be a real inconvenience. Then for a split second his gaze shifted to the manically laughing shadow, a very tall shadow at that. He squints his eyes to try and get a better look at the fellow but he felt the Chroma move from his back and he ducked down as the pelt was given form and it let out a piercing screech, almost piercing his ear drums…well…not anymore than they are. Grinding his teeth he looks up as the pelt froze the infested for a moment <em>”Now or never”</em> The man stabbed his sword to the ground to free his right arm, keeping the shield up in front of him during this time. Etaler dugs inside his trusty satchels and pulls out a Potent Pherilac Pod. 

“Get ready to run!”

He yells out and chucks it down the hall on the opposite end of the reopened passage,, hoping the pheromones would attract the infested and go after it, giving Etaler and the Chroma enough time to retreat to a choking point.</span>

Kapak jumped up onto his feet, his flesh ragged and hanging from his figure like loose fitting clothes, but quickly growing back.
He cracked his neck. &quot;Alright. Let&#39;s dance.&quot;
Kapak grabbed his Torid by the barrel and flung it across the room at the other Charger, stunning it for a moment while he ran along the hallway and landed a vertical punch downwards onto the other Charger, his fist tearing a hole through its back. He reached with his nails and tore out the monster&#39;s misshapen heart, crushing it and flinging it aside. The stunned Charger wobbled briefly before bearing down on Kapak, who simply sidestepped the lunging creature. He grabbed its legs as it ran past and pulled mightily, disconnecting its lower half from its upper torso.
&quot;There&#39;s never any end to these things. Probably a hive somewhere on this ship,&quot; Kapak talked to himself as he ripped the arm off of a Runner and slammed it against its head like a bat.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s controlling these muckers if I can find it and destroy it,&quot; he continued to speculate as he beat down another two Infested with the arm.</span>

&quot;Razogoth! Here girl!&quot; The Nidus called out as he backed down the hall. The Helminth Charger finished biting the head off of the Crawler it was engaged with before barreling after her master.
<em>I hope those two folks aren&#39;t in range of this,</em> Kapak thought as he released the detonation signal pheromones.
Mere seconds later, the room of Infested shook as the maggots popped and exploded into amber fireworks of slimy and fiery death. The shockwave of the explosion resonated down the hallway and knocked Kapak onto his rear, with Razogoth landing on top of him.</span>

~The pherilac pod causes quite a few of the Infested to break off to charge after it, allowing them a split second to breath and prepare themselves for the continued assault. Granted, the pod had not dealt with all of them, but it had thinned their ranks quite a bit. However, just as things seem to get better, three Ancients burst through a vent, all charging after the two of them.
Not only that, but a brief flash crossed Leveret&#39;s field of vision, and another kunai was thrown directly at the throat of the Warframe, followed by another to the weapon Leveret was holding. The direction they came from changed quite a bit, which certainly seemed like something &#39;Big Ugly&#39; would do.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~With the Infested now charging in his direction, following the pherilac pod, many more of them were caught in the blast, thinning out the horde even more. It seemed like things were looking up for him. Ignoring the three Ancients that burst into the ambush room to attack the two standing in the middle, though.
After a brief pause in the fighting, everything seemed to calm down around Kapak. However, without warning, what appeared to be a set of long, glowing claws slashed across Razogoth. Assuming it hit her (your move, after all), the slash would leave a very deep, instantly-cauterized wound that would likely deal some <em>serious</em> damage. Oddly enough, it would appear that the claws were similar to that of a Valkyr. Not something you would expect to see in a place like this, and not something you would expect to attack a Tenno or their pet.~</span>

Leveret shuffled to his feet as his pelt poured frigid fog onto the remaining infested. &quot;HEY, BIG UGLY!&quot; he yelled as he turned to face the incoming ancients, &quot;LONG TIME NO SEE, EH? WHAT&#39;S IT BEEN, TWO WEEKS? I B-&quot;
His taunting was cut short by two more metallic pings, one kunai chipping off a small chunk of ice armor under his chin, the other slicing a groove across the top of his ignis. His shields took most of the damage from the neck shot, hardening his armor yet further. With a majority of the infested dealt with - aside from the ancients - his donned his pelt and unleashed a blast of cold towards the tentacled creatures, hoping to at least slow them down, if not damage them. He pulled Etaler with him, backing down the hallway away from the ancients as he continued to exhale.
Unfortunately, moving backwards meant he wouldn&#39;t see anything going on behind him, but he took slow steps to avoid tripping as he backed into the hallway.</span>

It worked! Well it didn’t deal with all of them but at least a huge portion went after the pod giving him and the Chroma some breathing space. But that peace was short lived as another set of chaos was unleashed upon the room. First that ungodly screech, then the kunai bouncing around again, the appearance of the ancients and fleshy explosions. Etaler felt overwhelmed by all of this so he was kind of glad that the Chroma grabbed on to him and tugged him away. He quickly puts his fiery sword and shield to pull out his old and rusty Viper, letting loose a suppressing volley of bullets towards the Ancients and what little infested that continued to follow them as the duo backed to the hallway.</span>

Kapak saw the blades of light racing through the air towards Razogoth but was too late to act.
“Razogoth, look-“
The claws tore through the Infested Hound’s Side, causing ribbons of blood to fly outwards. The wounds were warped and twisted, inhibiting it’s ability to heal.
“Voiddamnit!” Kapak cursed as he dropped to one knee next to his whimpering companion. Razogoth’s intestines hung out of her side like a spilled bowl of noodles. Kapak extended a hose-like appendage from his wrist and jabbed its barbed end into her neck, sending some of his own blood into the Helminth Charger-  fortunately they shared the exact same eurethrocytes.
Hoping to stabilize her, Kapak’s back opened up and caused another round of maggot to drop out onto the floor, squealing as fiercely as such small, minute creatures could. They formed a perimeter while Kapak tended to his pet.</span>

~As the two back into the hallway, the now-frozen ancients fall to the ground, now very full of bullets from the Viper. Again, things seemed to calm down for a moment. And then, in a split second, both Leveret&#39;s and Etaler&#39;s guns jam, followed immediately by three kunai this time. One was aimed directly at the throat of Etaler, and another two at Leveret&#39;s head again. It would seem that whoever was throwing these was both managing to stay hidden, and was changing locations constantly. This certainly wasn&#39;t the work of some Infested.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~The clawed thing attacked again, this time from directly above to avoid the maggots. It jumped down onto Kapak&#39;s back (which would do quite a bit of damage anyway) before attempting to sink its claws into his back. This was immediately followed by an ear splitting shriek from the thing, before it leaped back up at the ceiling and into an open air vent. The claws were obviously made out of void energy, almost certainly proving the whole Valkyr theory.~</span>

As soon as his ignis failed to shoot flames, he quickly holstered it. Metal plates emerged from under the pelt on his left arm and he drew an axe, revealing his ack and brunt. He rushed to activate the electromagnetic shielding and ready his defense for the kunai he knew would be coming. Sure enough, the orange-gold string of energy that connected him to Etaler drew two Kunai towards his shield, and the second one aimed at him bounced off the back of his head with another metallic ping. 

He continued backwards until he heard an ear-splitting shriek, whipping around to look at the source of the noise. ((next part assumes he sees Kapak)) His helmet light fell upon the mutated nidus and his unfortunate companion surrounded by a ring of maggots. &quot;Oh for- <em>Please</em> tell me you&#39;re not one of Clogori&#39;s minions. Please say words so I know you&#39;re not trying to kill me.&quot; he said hurriedly, his helmet light flicking around the room, searching for unseen danger.</span>

He emptied one clip, then another, but before he could empty a third clip at the infested the gun cocked with a familiar click sound. The bandaged man hissed under his breath and with his free hand slaps the damned gun. But a flash from the corner of his eye quickly caught his attention and he instinctively lifts his free hand to cover his head,  but the projectile twisted last second to the Chroma&#39;s shield and bounced off just like the previous two.

“Who is this?!”

Fed up he finally yells up as he pockets his viper and whips out his scanner once more to try and get a reading of his kunai throwing menace as he retreated with the Chroma.</span>

The Nidus shrieked in pain as the claws savaged their way into his spine combined with the force of the figure dropping into him. He stumbled, causing the cord he was feeding Razogoth blood with to fray and leak across the floor. As the supposed Valkyr disappeared into the vent, Kapak turned his attention back to his pet. She lay cold and still, her bioluminescent patches glowing dimmer and dimmer by the second.
“Well,” Kapak said, grimacing as he stood up, “that’s 2 days.” He stretched and dislocated his arms in order to feel the wounds on his back.
“Void, that’s gonna be there for a while.” He cursed, inhaling sharply.
Suddenly, the bright light of Leveret blasted into his face, blinding him for a moment.
“Argh!! Point that thing somewhere else!!” He rubbed the front of his cherry-red, bulbous head. “No, I’m not one of ‘glow-orgy’s’ minions.” As his eyes adjusted to the light, he regarded the Chroma.
<em><s>the forbidden form</s></em>
“You got yourselves into this mess,” Kapak grunted as he snapped his arms back into their normal positions. “Eris is no place for solo operatives.”
He coughed awkwardly as Etaler showed up beside the Leveret.
“Um.... or duos. Look, I can guarantee you I’m not the bad guy here...” Kapak fumbled around.
<em>Gutsgutsgutsgutsguts I don’t have annyyyyy moustaches with meeeee.....!</em>
He leaned against the wall with one hand covering his mouth in what he hoped was a thoughtful looking pose.</span>

~With the Infested dealt with, everything around them fell silent. Even the Valkyr from moments ago seemed to either be staying completely silent, or it had managed to escape after crippling Kapak and his infested doggo momentarily. The kunai stopped. The screeches of Infested stopped. The piles of corpses left by their battle moments before surrounded them and filled the room. Etaler&#39;s scans showed nothing, besides the Infested growths present throughout the entire ship. It seemed that whatever had attacked them with the kunai moments before had made an escape as well. This almost seemed to be a hit-and-run tactic, oddly enough. It was, of course, very strange that what appeared to be Tenno were assisting the Infested in some way.~</span>

&quot;Rahm. He got away.&quot; Leveret looked around, dimming his light as his gaze returned to Kapak. &quot;Still, I suppose that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;

He sighed deeply and his icy armor disappeared, but he kept his axe and shield ready. &quot;I&#39;m very glad to hear you&#39;re not with them. We&#39;ll need all the help we can get, if you&#39;re willing.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he said to Etaler, &quot;That was a little taste of why I asked if you&#39;ve fought tenno before. I....should probably explain a bit more.

There&#39;s a guy in here somewhere, cooking up the worse infestation strain I&#39;ve ever seen. And he&#39;s infecting warframes, and, well...here we are. And I&#39;ve got friends in here, too.

The man huffed under his breath, which sounded more like someone held him against a pillow, muffled and dim. Sure, the infestation is no place for solo operatives but he’s been in a ship such as this. Maybe the infestation wasn’t as intelligent as this one but he has many tricks up his sleeve…or er…belt. The man listens to the conversation but his gaze is focused on the scanner in his hands. Noticing the lack of blobs on it he exhales sharply and pockets it, turning to finally gaze upon the tall lanky shadow that he saw looming near the door during the fight.

Well…this Nidus does look different, more alive. He eyes him for a moment with his pale, almost blind looking eyes, traveling from toes to head. If the Nidus meant them harm than he’s sure he would attack them by now…no matter the ugliness. He glances down at the familiar form of a infested charger and lifts his white gaze at the fleshy frame.

“I have a med kit if you need it, has a pack of nutrients”

He reaches under his garment, pulling out a little box that was once colored white but its now more of a piss color. He outstretches his hand towards the Nidus, offering it to him if he wants it. Now, Etaler isn’t a expert on infested biology but that charger looks really rough.

His gaze then twirls to the Chroma as he spoke about the infestation. With wrinkled brows, he talks in his muffled and raspy voice sounding as if claws are raking through metal.

“This sounds worse than I thought. A special strain…hm…”

He pulls out his old and rusty viper that looks like it’s been through a lot of trenches. He ejects the latest mag and checks the bullet count in it, all the while speaking to the Chroma.

“Either way, I came here in hope to find survivors but that mission just changed”

He shoves the mag back in the viper and cocks it, lifting his head to look at both of them</span>

He regarded the medkit for exactly one second before punting Razogoth’s lifeless body across the hall, splatting into a bloody mess against the wall. It seems like its body had already begun to decompose and fall apart.
“Thanks for the offer though,” Kapak said as he leaned back against the wall, hoping that the dim lighting would be enough to keep his face unrecognizable.
“I tell you what, peoples,” he spoke with purpose, “I’ll stick around with you.” Not that Kapak had much of a choice. If he stuck around and they stuck around, they’d bump into each other again eventually. “You need an expert of the Infestation of your own, and that would be me.”
He stepped away from the wall and bowed dramatically as well as comically. “The Plague Doctor is here!” He tried to suppress it, but he couldn’t fully hide the grin from his mutant mouth.
“Tell me more about this... Big Ugly.” He cursed for a moment as he banged his head on the ceiling before returning to his ‘casual position’ against the wall.</span>

&quot;Plague doctor, eh? If that means you have medical expertise, you&#39;re more than welcome to join us. As for Big Ugly...well, I don&#39;t know as much about him as I&#39;d like to. His name is Tarnas, and he used to be a normal Tenno, from what I&#39;ve told. But this strain...it messed him up. You&#39;ll know what I mean if you see him. Everything about him is just <em>wrong.</em> He still has Loki powers, and there&#39;s still an operator, but he&#39;s gone completely mad. Hence me asking you to talk. I was making sure you&#39;re still...sane.&quot;

He sighed, a puff of greyish mist emerging from his helmet. &quot;Anyway, he can do everything a normal Loki can do, but he&#39;s bigger, stronger, and can regenerate. I also think he may not be capable of feeling pain. From what I&#39;ve heard from my friend, this isn&#39;t the first tenno this guy, Clogori, has done this to. There&#39;s more of these, and they&#39;re probably here on this ship, but he can&#39;t really control them. Or he doesn&#39;t want to, I suppose. He&#39;s put a lot of work into all this, and from what I understand, he maaaaay or may not want to purge the entire origin system with this stuff. We&#39;re talking a weapon of mass destruction that would make Red Veil wet themselves with excitement.&quot;</span>

He followed the flying charger with his pale eyes at the Nidus kicked it across. The bandaged man shrugged his shoulders and returns his old med-kit back in it’s place on his trusty belt. His gaze then traveled back to the Nidus as he introduced himself as the Plague Doctor, sure, weird title but these kids are knocked on the head and it&#39;s not the weirdest he&#39;s heard. 

He looks towards the Chroma as he explained as to who this Big Ugly fellow is and the more the wider one of his eyes opened up. 

Etaler let out a huff though his nose and spoke up in his muffled voice

“I don’t suppose these warframes have any weakness then? Seeing as how they’re next to gods”

His eyes narrow as he looks back through the hallway and to the room that the infested occupied mere seconds ago.

“And I assume this Clogori is onboard the ship now? Looking for something or just perfecting the concoction?”

If he’s going in a infested den filled with immortal and infested warframes then he’s sure as hell not going in without getting the whole scoop. Knowing what lies ahead is just the tip.</span>

He let out a sigh. “Weaknesses....hmm. The only thing I’ve figured out so far is that I can kick his ass if he’s in operator mode. I’ve only managed to do it once, and Clogori managed to escape with him before I could finish the job.”

He peered at the charger-splat on the wall thoughtfully, thinking about what else to say. “One of my friends brought a nullifier with him when they got here. Assuming he’s...still capable of operating it...” he shook that mental image out of his head and continued. “Assuming he’s still able to operate it, that should give us a head start. My current plan is to incapacitate the warframe, lure out the Tenno, finish off the warframe so he has nowhere to go, then pummel him into oblivion.”

“As for Clogori, yes, I’m certain he’s here. He wouldn’t let his prized experiments run wild like this without being around to watch and take notes.”</span>

“I know that feel,” Kapak chuckled. He glanced down the hallway and back at the others.
“And how would you plan on luring a Tenno from his Warframe?” Kapak asked. He knew full well it was easy to hide behind a suit of armour- he’d been doing so for years.
“I mean, I did do a similar thing once, here. Although it was mostly accredited to the fact that the other Tenno was a fool- Mercy was her name. She was a psychopath. She thought she could become the queen of all Infestation as long as she did what a hive mind asked of her. I confronted her then, and she stepped from her Warframe because she thought she had the power to destroy me. All I had to do was break her deactivated Warframe’s neck, drive my weapon through her chest and absorb her Oro.”
Kapak scratched his back, causing pieces of voidscarred flesh to flake off. “You seem to know these people better. Perhaps you can lure them out by appealing to their egos.” He scratched a little harder, causing a large mass of necrotic, burned flesh to drop from his back, the wound now beginning to heal properly. “In the meantime, I may be able to find a way to combat his Warframe. This wouldn’t be my first rodeo with mutant Warframes.”</span>

Leveret watched awkwardly as Kapak scratched the dead tissue off his back. He wasn’t used to anyone treating such a nasty wound so casually.
“Well, not really. Not enough to talk them into something stupid. My job is getting in the way of things, not talking. Last time I got him to do it was I void-dashed through him and siphoned his energy out, then he just got angry and popped out. The infested carried off his warframe, though. Hopefully this time I’ll be able to do this fast enough to stop that from happening.”
He shuffled his feet impatiently. “Like I said, I wasn’t planning on doing this much talking. I’m eager to get moving and find my friends before they both get ripped apart by Big Ugly or some other nasty creation of Clogori’s. Let’s walk and talk, but we should keep it to private comms in case the walls figured out how ears work.”</span>

~Most of the paths in this direction have been cut off by the other blast doors. The vents the Infested came through are probably too small for Warframes. So, the two obvious choices are to backtrack and head a different direction, or bust through another blast door. The ship is still quiet, the only noises being the droning white noise of the ship itself, and the occasional squelch of Infested growths. There are no footsteps, or breathing, or anything else that would signify the presence of any beings present, beyond the three of you.~</span>

The approach to the derelict cluster was fairly easy. A few pieces of debris here and there,  but it was easy to maneuver through. The hangar doors to one of the smaller ships was wide open currently, and it would appear that there were already a couple ships inside.~</span>

He glanced at the Nidus as he flaked off pieces of himself like shrugging off dried mud. Infested flesh has it’s advantages…if you look past the appearance. He rolled his pale eyes back at the Chroma as he spoke about a weakness which only caused the bandaged man to narrow his brows. That’s not really a usable weakness, but I guess it’s better than none. Etaler just hopes that one of these two Tenno will be able to reach the others Oro.

“Sounds like we’re hanging on to luck here”

He mumbles under his breath and pushes past the duo to walk back the way they came from. Blasting through the doors will cause a lot of commotion…then again it’s not like it matters cause every baddy on board knows they’re here and probably have eyes everywhere that are watching their every move.</span>

The Nidus gave one last look at the deceased Charger before shrugging and following the Arbiter.
“So who are you guys?” He asked, ducking under portions of collapsed ceiling that he was far too tall to fit under, “names, I mean. Or at least, what can I call you?”</span>

The dark robed man, wearing old worn white bandages around his head,  slowly lifts his pale eyes to look at the tall, fleshy warframe, his realization hitting him fast. “Oh, where are my manners?” The adrenaline from the fight still curses through him, his mind racing not with pleasantries but with tactics of how to get through this and it’s many outcomes. When faced with a near death scenario one tends to dive back to basic instincts and impulses. How rude of him to forget such a simple thing!

The man stops walking at once and faces the Nidus front first. He lifts his gloved hands up in front of him and offers a light bow to the fleshy warframe, saying in his muffled voice

“You can call me by my name, Etaler, no need for titles or nicknames.”

He straightens up from his polite bow and twirls his eyes towards the Chroma as he spoke. Etaler looked back down the eerie hallway and hummed under his breath – which comes out as nothing more than a strong vibration hitting against his bandages – True, double backing means that they will lose time. His gaze travels back to the Nidus – and he did open up a firmly shut door with ease – But…he’s not sure on that route…then again playing it safe didn’t really work out great before.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">&quot;Another buddy of mine just got here. He&#39;s on his way to meet up with us.&quot;</div>

His ears perk up, which can be seen by a slight movement of his bandages near where his ears should be. The man looks back at the Chroma, his eyes seeming blank of any emotion

“I see…this lifeless belt is getting really popular, it seems”

A joke of some sort, but with his flat voice and expressionless face, none can be so sure. The buff operative then looks towards the Nidus and tilts his head back down the corridor where the infested came from

“You think you can open up one of the sealed doors then?”</span>

“I could try,” Kapak offered as he approached one of the blast doors. He forced his fingers into the cracks in the door and pulled with all of his might. A piece of flesh departed from his back, slapping onto the ceiling and erupting into a swirling, furious maelstrom of tentacles which were quick to aid Kapak in the opening of the door.
“I can help you... err! Track down... errr!! Your friends possibly... errrr!!!” He replied to Leveret as he muscled the door.

The bandaged man followed after the Nidus and stopped a few paces behind him as he went down to business on the door. He pulls out his scanner and gets ready to put it to use once the door is opened…not that it helped so far…but EH.

The Arbiter operator lifts his head to look at the Chroma and huffs under his breath at him

“Is your comrade close?”

He simply asks before returning his gaze at the Nidus as he strains against the door

“Need any assistance, Tenno?”

He may look like he’s not that much, but Etaler is packing some hefty muscles under his dark robes, a award for a lifetime of servitude.</span>

Leveret looked hopefully towards Kapak. &quot;You can help track them? That would certainly make our job easier. I was just going on blast marks before....but if you can help at all, that would be fantastic. One of them has had kind of a streak of near-death experiences recently.&quot;

As soon as the doors were pried open, Leveret stepped forward and began searching for traces of gunfire or any other sign of his friends. 

&quot;He should be here soon,&quot; he replied to Etaler, &quot;I don&#39;t know how fast he&#39;s moving, but I didn&#39;t think the hallway was <em>that</em> long.&quot; His gaze turned down the hall they came from. The darkness seemed to swallow the beam of light from his helmet, leaving only the glowing patches boils covering the walls. &quot;You should be getting close,&quot; he said to Chegar over the comms, &quot;We&#39;re about to move deeper into the ship.&quot;</span>

~Right as Chegar recieves the message, he reaches a blast door clearly torn open, with the corpses of Infested seeming to spill out. It leads into a larger, more open room, with three more blast doors, and a whole lot of scorched corpses, all Infested. The moment he walked in, he would also see the source of the grinding metal: Two Tenno and a Hexis operative. Specifically, a Chroma and a Nidus. It would appear he found Leveret.~</span>

The white and orange chroma spun around, quickly spotting the nekros. He joyfully wrapped an arm around the shoulder of the more slender warframe for a moment, giving Chegar a quick squeeze/shake before releasing him. &quot;Void, it&#39;s good to see you. I was half expecting you not to come back after, you know, the whole exploding thing. Thought maybe you&#39;d be here waiting for us, covered in boils or something.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yeah....Tarnas has been throwing kunai at my throat. I didn&#39;t actually see him though. The infestation here is also absurdly smart. They&#39;re...using tactics. We got mobbed, and then they booked it deeper into the ship again. I think there are other....projects...of Clogori&#39;s here.&quot; He motioned to Kapak. &quot;There might be a Valkyr as well. Our buddy here got sliced up, and it killed his charger. I haven&#39;t found Efahz or Adrova yet, but we still have a chance of tracking them down.&quot;</span>

The man lifts his bandaged head to stare at the approaching Nekros and prepped himself for a bow, but then he freezes as his coms lit up.  Etaler tilts his head to the side as if he can hear the voice coming through it a lot clearer that way.

&quot;Ahhh&quot;

He sighs under his breath and lifts his eyes to look at the crowd, cupping his hands in front of him and offering them a curt but sincere bow

&quot;Apologies Tenno, but a urgent matter has sprung forth...and&quot;

He paused, his eyes jumping from the Chroma to the Nidus and then to the Nekros

&quot;I&#39;m confident you an handle yourselves....here&quot;

He fishes out of his many belt satchels a  makeshift grenade that looks like someone just pulled out the ammo from a Zarr and put it in a iron casing. He throws the gadget towards them, hoping one would catch it

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it is not unstable, but if you do wish to use it just throw it as hard as possible against a sturdy surface. Just make sure you&#39;re not within 40 meters of it&quot;

With that he will bow to them another time and turn to head back down the hallway to his awaiting landing craft</span>

The abnormally tall Nidus bowed awkwardly in response to the newcomer’s condolences.
“Eh,” he chuckled nervously, “no biggie.”
Needless to say, Kapak was getting uncomfortable with how many people he just met. The more people who came into play, the more likely it would be that one of them would recognize him.
“Call me The Plague Doctor,” Kapak said before Chegar turned to Leveret.
In the meantime, he caught Etaler’s grenade while the other two conversed.</span>

~The room around them is still completely still and dead quiet. Nothing but the piles of corpses, and the smell of burning flesh and decay, with just a hint of coolant. There is nothing of interest left in this room, unless you find mutated corpses cool. I&#39;m not judging, I think they&#39;re pretty neat.
The corridor on the other side of the blast door has next to no lighting, so the group is probably reliant on their own light sources. Almost every door on either side of the corridor has been grown over with masses of Infested. It shifts upon contact with any of the Tenno, repairing itself very quickly should any footsteps squish something. (This is in case they decide to go down this corridor.)~</span>

He watched Etaler leave. &quot;Alright. Stay safe.&quot; he said, watching the bandaged man leave before turning his attention to the remaining members of the group.
&quot;Now that Chegar&#39;s here,&quot; he said to Kapak, &quot;We should start tracking my friends. There&#39;s no telling what Clogori has planned for them. Based on those blast marks, he knows they&#39;re here.&quot;

Leveret&#39;s headlamp beam intensified slightly as he stared into the pitch dark, prodding at a growth with his foot and watching it repair itself. &quot;Looks like we won&#39;t have any tracks to follow from here on out.

The Nidus knelt down in an almost mockingly identical way before jamming his fingers into a boil-like node of glowing Infested flesh on the floor.
“Let me try reconnecting to the local dendrites and see if I can get another visual on your people. If I can, I can extract the memory of their scent and use it to follow them.”
His fingers squished around inside the boil, piercing the fleshy floor. He grunted softly as he extended mycelial veins through the Infestation, searching for nerves to hook onto.

Clearly, this strain has had a while to take over, at least on this ship. It&#39;s unknown what it&#39;ll be like on the other ships of this cluster.

~Success! It would appear that the group is in luck. The two crewnen have indeed been here. Seeing as this corridor likely led further into the ship, that only made sense.

“Got ‘em!” The Nidus grinned triumphantly, rising back onto his feet- except bonking his head on the ceiling. 
“Fathermucker- ergh! Uh, anyways! Excuse me! I’ve got their scent, and seen where they were headed. They’re likely balls deep in the Infested right now- they were headed deeper and deeper into this place.”
He scratched his skull. “Why would they run towards the middle? I’m assuming they were trying to escape?”
He began to walk forward, following the path that the two targets had taken, murmuring to himself something about ‘psychotic Tenno’ and ‘dumb Corpus’.</span>

~The path is rather difficult to walk on, what with the squishy, slightly pulsating floor. As they go further, they are completely surrounded by the darkness, the only source of light beside whatever the Tenno are carrying being the light from the entrance they came through, and that wasn&#39;t doing much.

&quot;Good. Let&#39;s keep moving then.&quot; Leveret said as he pushed forward. Every so often, he&#39;d give the spongy floor a quick scorch to make it easier to keep moving. He had seriously picked up the pace at this point, both out of anger towards Clogori and concern for his friends. Even when he stumbled on the slick ground, he&#39;d push back to his feet and keep going. 

&quot;And for the record, Doc, they&#39;re not trying to escape. They came here for the same reason I did: to stop Clogori. I&#39;m just also here to make sure they both get out alive.&quot;
<em>Because void knows they wouldn&#39;t otherwise...</em> 

Leveret knew Clogori had probably captured Efahz and Adrova at this point, but his helmet-mounted light continued to flick over the pulsating walls as he searched for any sign of his friends. He half expected to see a gloved hand reaching out of the wall, surrounded by glowing boils, or a mostly-buried helmet held to the floor by a mass of sinew. He shivered at his own disturbing ideas, speeding up as best he could manage on the hazardous floor.</span>

The Nidus’ muttering and cursing continued even more fervently after hearing Leveret explain.
“Voiddamn, that’s practically suicide. Two random-arse Corpus trying to stop a corrupted Tenno, pah!! Should have hired a professional or put together a larger team. Even hired some wankers like Plaguewatch or something. Humph! I better get paid some good stuff for this too.”
Possibly Kapak’s curiosity would bear its own fruit of reward... capturing this Clogori individual may just allow him to extract some juicy biological secrets he could use for himself.
Kapak continued his march forward, obviously unafraid of whatever horrors lurked in the darkness. If anything, he was grumpy being there. Periodically, his massive torso would squat down to re-link to the Infested “cctv” and make sure he was still on the right path.</span>

~No further communications came for the time being. The only noise was now the squelching of the Infested growths, and the occasional flickering from the lights. The corridor continued on for quite a while, and there were no signs that anyone had been here, until...
There was a barrel of a gun sticking out from the growths on the ground, not consumed by the Infested yet. It was a Corpus weapon. A Tetra, to be specific.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~One strange thing about what he saw whenever he tapped into the Infested, the growths seemed to be far less prevalent. The corridor had some here and there, but nothing compared to the complete layer of Infestation on everything. Finally, after a while, he would finally see where the two Crewmen had gone next. After running down this corridor for a while, firing occasionally at what appeared to be several chargers chasing them, they ran into one of the smaller rooms branching off of this corridor. Specifically, one of the many ones with Infested growths blocking the doors. It would be simple to deduct which of these rooms they ran into, but getting through the door might be easier said than done.~</span>

“Oh...shit...” Leveret whispered, looking down to see his toe had collided with a tetra. He wrenched it free, turning it over in his hands. “Now there’s one gun for the two of them. This isn’t good. Knowing both of them, Adrova’s probably the one who managed to keep his...” he trailed off, sounding concerned, then sighed in frustration when he picked up the tail end of Kapak’s rant.

“Doc, listen, they aren’t idiots-“ <em>’just...canon...fodder...’</em> “Well, they kind of are. But they knew the risks. They went in knowing full well they probably wouldn’t come back out.

Whatever Leveret or Chegar&#39;s answer was, Kapak barely listened. He turned to face the door the two Corpus had vanished through.

~The coast was still clear. But off in the distance, just barely audible, the sound of an Infested screech. Given the almost absolute silence after their last fight, this was odd. There was something... wrong with the screech, as well. It sounded a bit more &#39;human&#39;, for lack of a better word. It was unmistakeable Infested, but something about it was different.

The scream made Leveret’s blood run cold. It was too warped for him to figure out if it was one of his friends or not, but he knew it probably was. Using a string of grineer swear words to cover up his growing fear for his missing friends, he stepped bodily in front of Kapak and readied his ignis.

“Stand back.” He grunted, barely a warning as he began a spray of fire onto the mass on the door. Once the growths were sufficiently toasted, he took his axe and began recklessly hacking away at the charred remains until the door was operable.

As soon as the door opened, he stepped through, shield at the ready, furiously searching for any sign of his friends. The scream, though finished, echoed through his mind as he pushed forward in search of Efahz and Adrova.</span>

“Wawawawawai-“ Kapak stuttered in alarm as Leveret readied his Ignis. The Nidus threw himself backwards as the infernal storm spat itself out from the weapon’s nozzle, engulfing the door’s Infestation.
<span class="pre pre--inline">Fire fire fire, the dragon’s wrath unleashed</span>

Kapak wobbled for a moment as his pyrophobia took the better of him, but fortunately it seemed that the other Tenno was in a far too wild state to notice him.
Kapak steadied himself and shook his head, staring dumbstruck as the crazed warrior charged through the door.
“Void,” he muttered, “crazy. Oi! Calm yourself, man! We can save them.”
Kapak stomped forward after the Chroma. “Seriously though, do tell me what the plan was.” He huffed again, slightly peeved that he wasn’t getting any answers.</span>

~The door struggled to open, but it managed after a moment. Crates were piled up against the door, and spilled out around Leveret and Kapak. Beyond all of these obstacles, the room was pitch-black, flashlights being the only plausible way of seeing. The room was mostly empty, all of the crates being right there at the door. In one corner, though, there sat a crewman, clutching a cestra pointed at Leveret and Kapak, shaking.

&quot;G-get b-b-back... I&#39;ll shoot!&quot; They shouted. The voice very clearly belonged to Efahz. &quot;T-t-tell Clogori he w-won&#39;t take me alive!&quot; He sounded desperate right now, and didn&#39;t recognize Leveret in the dark. And then, without warning, he squeezed the trigger, firing wildly, managing to hit everything but the two Tenno, several shots hitting the ceiling and walls.~</span>

There were a few pings as a couple of shots were drawn to the center of Leveret’s shield and deflected onto the floor. “WHOA! Whoa, hey! Efahz it’s me!!” He said, dimming his light to avoid blinding him. As soon as it was clear the crewman knew who he was, he rushed forward and pulled Efahz into a rib-crushing bear hug.

“Oh, void I’m glad to see you! I thought for sure you’d been captured, or worse.” He finally let go, looking Efahz over for injuries. “Are you okay? Did any of the infested touch you? I...where’s Adrova?” He looked around, heart sinking again. “That was him screaming...wasn’t it.”</span>

There was the sliding sound of metal. Kapak looked up for a moment, stepping backwards one step before a piece of metal dislodged by Efahz’s wild shots dropped from its previously unseen yet precarious position, end first.
The scrap metal beam skewered Kapak through the torso and into the floor with a squishy <em>thunk.</em>
“Muck.” Kapak swore, running his fingers up and down the piece of metal. A mixture of amber fluid, blood, and a purple juice leaked from his wound, creating a revolting puddle of bioluminescent viscera on the floor.
“Hmmm.” He tugged at the metal a little bit, a frown forming on his face. “That’s awkward. Ahem, uh, hello there.” Kapak waved at the Corpus before turning his head sideways &amp; coughing blood up.</span>

&quot;N-no... it was one of Clogori&#39;s... things...&quot; Efahz struggled to say, between the panic and the hug. &quot;Adrova... he went ahead through the vents to find some... medical supplies...&quot; Efahz&#39;s suit hid any injuries he may have, but there was very clearly something wrong with his leg.

&quot;W-who&#39;s that?&quot; He shakily pointed at the bleeding Kapak. He seemed oddly unfazed by the bleeding Nidus in front of him. He was probably adjusted to seeing weird Infested by this point, and it seemed to be nice enough. &quot;New f-friend of yours?&quot;</span>

“Good, he’s...probably still alive.” He sighed in concern, a puff of grayish mist emerging from his helmet. “Yeah, he’s a new friend. He can probably help—“ he turned and stopped, staring at Kapak speared to the floor.

“Uh. Holy shit. Do you. Need some help there...?” He asked, hesitant to leave Efahz. The wound looked nasty but the nidus seemed oddly calm about it.</span>

The Nidus stepped forward and pulled violently, his body shearing in half. A good bucket of blood and other bodily fluids dripped onto the floor as Kapak wobbled forward, the two halves of his body flopping around like flags on a breezy day.
&quot;Nope, there we go! I got it.&quot; He stepped forward towards Efahz and extended an arm towards the Corpus man. &quot;Nice to meet you, I&#39;m The Plague Doctor.&quot;
Kapak&#39;s torn body became less and less floppy as the wound began to seal up from the bottom up, almost as if a giant invisible hand were pulling up a zipper.</span>

I think it was that... that one Valkyr... I&#39;m not sure how much control Clogori has over it...&quot; Another screech in the distance, just like the one before. Now that Efahz mentioned that, it did sound vaguely like the shouts of a Valkyr.

Leveret stared in disbelief as the nidus casually bisected himself, then offered a hand to shake. “Doc, please, if you’re not in immediate danger of dying, can you cut the formalities and fix up my friend?”

He turned to Efahz and tried to help adjust his leg to a more comfortable position without jostling it too much. “Okay. You’re gonna be fine. Nothing we can’t fix.” He said, attempting to reassure Efahz, giving his shoulder a squeeze. “Soon as you’re back on your feet we’ll find Adrova.”</span>

Kapak was slightly startled by the sudden reappearance of Chegar.
“‘Bout time you showed up,” he grumbled as the last marks of his wound disappeared, “at least you made my job easy.”
Kapak knelt down next to Efahz  and rolled up the Corpus’ pant leg. He gingery pricked his thigh with a fleshy cord that extended from his wrist.
“Just painkillers,” he whispered to Efahz as he worked. Kapak took his other hand and dug his finger tips into Efahz’s shin. The Corpus would have felt a little bit of a wriggling sensation from under his skin as Kapak injected a dose of Infested lymph into the skeletal muscle around his leg.
“Fortunately that dem- ahem, that Vazarin power reset your bones. That’ll mean all I have to do is mend the fracture.” Kapak’s fingertips remained inside Efahz’s leg. “ You have a comminuted fracture. You’re pretty lucky that it’s not an open fracture. A wound like that in an Infested zone is just asking for infection.”
There was a tingling sensation now washing over Efahz’s leg.
“Fractures mended. I’m sending the last of my technocytes through your bloodstream just to check for external Infestation.” Kapak glanced at Leveret. “I’ll kill off my own once the check is done.”
Kapak gently pulled the tips of his fingers out from the Corpus’s shin, the 4 small prick marks disappearing in mere seconds. The Nidus remained kneeling next to Efahz with the Infested cord still linked to him.
“Just a couple more minutes. I’m using my own body as a dialytic proxy to scrub his blood clean. In the meantime, why don’t you two tell me what in the Void your plan was?”
(( <span class="mention" title="Daakjenaar#7018">@Daakjenaar</span> You can determine whether or not Kapak senses any Infestation in Efahz’s body.))</span>

&quot;Chegar? W-when did you g-get here? I thought... after Europa...&quot; Efahz was caught off-guard by the Infested tendrils currently inside of his skin, almost jerking his leg back right there. If it wasn&#39;t already feeling so much better, he might have tried to push Kapak away. &quot;How... how are you doing that?&quot; This was, of course, the first time he had ever seen anything like this.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve explained my half of the whole thing, with following Clogori here and all that.&quot; He said to Kapak, then turning to Efahz. &quot;I&#39;m still not entirely sure why you two thought it was a good idea not to wait for me, though.

Kapak withdrew his fleshy appendages from Efahz, his small wounds almost instantly closing up.
“Lots of experience,” Kapak said with a grin to the Corpus, leaning over to pick some of the Infestation off of Efahz and pop it into his boney jaws. “I had a splendid... teacher.”
There was a crunch as he chewed through the infected issue’s cartiledge.
“Mmm. High in calcium.” He stood up to his full height again, stretching momentarily as he easily avoided bumping into the ceiling again.
“Now as a fair warning, the Technocytes I placed in your body to aid in the healing have all commited apoptosis, so they’re gonna filter through into your bladder and get expelled through your urine, which may appear bloody and glow in the dark. Don’t be alarmed though, unless this persists for more than a week.”
The Nidus picked his tooth and glanced at Chegar before focusing back on Leveret.
“So what’s the plan now, big man? I’m assuming you want to find your other foolish Corpus before seeking out this Chlorox or Cloggy or whatever fellow.&quot;</span>

<em>Efahz</em>
&quot;We found Clogori. I suggested that we wait for you, but Adrova wanted to check out the area, and see if this was the place. It was, but then we got seperated from the ship. We kept heading forward, but they just kept following us...&quot; Efahz tried struggling to his feet, keeping all of his weight on his good leg. &quot;It was good that you came here when you did. We might both be dead if you hadn&#39;t.&quot; Efahz turned to look at Kapak for a moment.

&quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve... ever seen healing like that. I&#39;ve had needles poked into me, but never infested ones. It&#39;s... weird.&quot; Efahz said to Kapak. &quot;Thanks, though. Feeling a lot better.&quot;

~Besides the recovered Efahz, there isn&#39;t much else in the room. A couple empty crates here and there, that weren&#39;t piled up at the door. There was also an open air vent on the wall opposite to Efahz. That was likely where Adrova had gone.~</span>

“Yes. I’m not leaving without both of them.” He asserted to Kapak, standing quickly and helping Efahz to his feet. He took a moment to brush off some of the infested tissue from his friend. “I’m glad you’re alright,” he said, putting one arm around him and giving him a quick side-hug. “If you’re sure you’re ready to keep moving, let’s go find Adrova. We’re going to need that nullifier if we want to win this.”

Naturally, Leveret was the first to climb up into the vent. It was a close fit for the bulky Chroma but he was still able to move around enough to turn and offer Efahz a hand up.

As soon as his friend was in the vent behind him, he moved forward to make room for the rest of the group. “Hopefully he hasn’t gone too far. When did you lose contact with him?”</span>

“Hey, you know you could take that voiddamn jacket off to fit through there better!” Kapak ridiculed Leveret. He sighed and pushed himself into the vent, making an annoying squeaking noise as his fleshy sides were promptly jammed into place.
“Fathermucker,” Kapak cursed as he shuffled one hand down to his rib cage and pushed. He coughed as there was a cracking sound resounding through the vent. Kapak, now with a broken rib cage underneath his fleshy Warframe muscle could shimmy slightly easier through the vent after the other two.</span>

&quot;Er... are you okay?&quot; Efahz asked Kapak. Again, he hardly seemed fazed by any of this at this point, having already seen him get impaled, eat Infested, and generally do things that one would not consider nowhere. Efahz was a bit hesitant to follow Kapak through the vent, but he did after letting him get a bit of a head start. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ve served on ships like this, so I think I have a pretty good idea where the nearest medbay is.&quot;

~The vent itself continues on for quite a while, and it is rather cramped. However, there were no Infested to jump out and attack the group. Whether that was a good thing or not was probably debatable, given their previous patterns. It branches off occasionally, but Efahz would tell the group what direction to head.~</span>

He continued forward through the vent, doing his best to keep a pace the rest of the group could keep up with. “I’ll just push forward till we reach a fork in the vent, yeah?” He called back to Efahz.</span>

~In the distance, that same scream from earlier can be heard every once in a while. As they neared the medbay, what sounded like gunfire from a Corpus weapon could be heard. Efahz didn&#39;t say anything about this, but it was pretty likely that Adrova was the one firing. When they reached the medbay itself, they found it to be in surprisingly good condition. There were a few growths here and there, but nothing severe. Unfortunately, this place had clearly been ransacked, as <em>all</em> of the medical equipment and supplies were gone.

There was something out of place here, though. The door on the far side of the room appears to have been damaged. Long claw marks visible all over it. Chunks of metal were very clearly missing, and it would appear that something had tried to break in, or break out. It looked awfully like the claw marks on Kapak&#39;s pet from earlier.~

<em>Efahz</em>
Efahz climbed out of the vent, and looked around. Then he saw the damaged door. &quot;That... thing must have gone after him. Then that means...&quot; Efahz trailed off for a moment. &quot;We have to move. Now.&quot; He reached for his sidearm, a cestra, before running/limping slightly across the room and through the door, gesturing for everyone else to follow.</span>

Leveret hurried ahead, his Ignis at the ready. He did his best to keep a pace that Efahz could match while still hurrying to search for Adrova.

~It would appear that the nearest terminal had already been in use, if Chegar were to activate it. Someone had been using this to hack into one of the other ship systems, and it had probably been done very recently.

Despite the frosty protection, they would still find they had full mobility.

“Ammo ends up being a pretty big problem for people on Infested ships,” Kapak spoke, seemingly to himself more than anyone else, “since you get swarmed from everywhere with huge numbers. Not enough bullets to go around.”
As he spoke, he pulled the Torid from his back, checking that the living missiles within were loaded. He followed closely behind Efahz, his long legs carrying him near his rear while keeping his line of fire over the Corpus’ head.</span>

~Efahz continued ruinning down the corridor, the lack of visibility making navigation slightly more difficult. He continued on the same direction, and occasional bursts of weapon fire seemed to come from this direction. After a little bit longer, the occasional blue flash of a Corpus weapon could be visible. The Infested growths became thicker as they got closer, covering much more of the wall now. Finally, another Crewman came into view. He carried a Tetra, pointing it up at the ceiling. Hearing the footsteps, he quickly turned to face the group, pointing the gun at the trio.~
<em>Efahz</em>
&quot;Adrova! It&#39;s me!&quot; Efahz said quickly, keeping his weapon lowered. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Lev&#39;s here.&quot; 
<em>Adrova</em>
&quot;Listen, we don&#39;t have time to have a happy little reuinion right now.&quot; Adrova whispered, aiming his weapon back up at the ceiling. &quot;That thing&#39;s up there, somewhere.&quot;

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Chegar recieves the feeds of many of the still-functioning cameras in this ship. Unfortunately, not many of the cameras still functioned. He could see a few of the nearby corridors, and one of the feeds could actually see Leveret, Kapak, and Efahz apparently speaking to another Crewman. Visibility was poor, and there was no audio, but it was possible to see the four people standing in the corridor.~</span>

Using his axe to help hack through any infested in his way, Leveret hurried forward until he saw Adrova, then changed course to maneuver into a better defensive position. 

Once he was close enough, the layer of icy armor formed over Adrova as well. Leveret peered up into the darkness above them, dimming his light in the hope of avoiding provoking the demented creature.

“You two stay behind me,” Leveret whispered, “when it attacks I want it going after me or Doc.” He tilted his head towards Kapak. “The Nidus is with us.” He added for Adrova’s sake.</span>

~The two Corpus took position near Leveret. Efahz nodded to Adrova, and they started firing burts from their tetras at the ceiling, aiming for the vents. Adrova backed away a bit, clearly trying to keep moving. There didn&#39;t seem to be any response from anything inside of the vents, and the sounds of gunfire drowned out any possible background noises. Unfortunately... maybe backing away from the tenno protecting them was a poor idea. In between bursts, there was a flash of light, and a ripline pierced Adrova&#39;s back, coming from the vents above, rather far away from any of the explosions/gunfire. There was an incredibly, incredibly small window to react, as Adrova was yanked back up into the vent.~</span>

“RAHM! Hold fire!” He yelled, not fast enough to stop Adrova from being yanked away. Thinking fast, he shed his pelt - which let out a paralyzing, screeching roar - and bullet-jumped towards the vent, catching himself and scrambling inside.

“Stay together and try and cut her off!” He yelled over comms, scrambling to find Adrova and the Valkyr in the dark of the vents.</span>

<u>Kapak:</u>
Kapak massaged his skull, his ears still ringing. He stood up, shakily at first, before rushing next to Efahz.
“Okay man, you stick with me now. Can’t have you end up like your pal.”
He heard Chegar over the comms.
“Sorry, Deadman, we didn’t tag ‘em with anything. We just found him, so unless Lev has already tagged him, which he definitely did NOT, we gotta manually hunt him down.”
He turned to Efahz.
“Want to go in there after him? I can boost you up, or we can just chill down here where you’ll be far safer.”

~Indeed, the vents were very, very dark. The only light came from the corridor below, and that was already rather dim. Clearly, this Valkyr was rather silent, as the only noises came from the rest of the group in the corridor below, and the background noise coming from the ship itself. As he moves through the vents, there&#39;s no sign of the Valkyr or Adrova. Well, not immediately. This vent is also connected to the corridor above, as was evident when several glowing claws stabbed through from above, aiming to behead Leveret.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
<em>Efahz</em>
&quot;I... I don&#39;t want to get in his way. He knows what he&#39;s doing...&quot; Efahz looked around nervously, pointing his Tetra at random things.
~Unfortunately, it would seem that the two of them weren&#39;t safe. The ground below them began... glowing. A moment later, it almost seemed to burst into flames. Bright green flames. Efahz basically flung himself away from this patch of really, really weird fire. Kapak would likely be able to identify this as an Oberon&#39;s hallowed ground. If he didn&#39;t get out of the way, he would probably become very, very familiar with it.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~The gunfire stopped for a moment, as Leveret went after Adrova. However, it wouldn&#39;t be smooth sailing on his way to meet up with the others, when a kunai whizzed past him, embedding itself in a nearby wall, followed by a second one immediately afterwards from the opposite direction. Both seemed to come out of nowhere.~</span>

Switching his helmet light on to the brightest setting, he barely managed to duck and bring his arms up in time to block the onslaught of claws. His vex armor and shields absorbed a fair amount of damage, but the glowing claws still raked through the layer of ice on him and left scratches on his arms.

Rolling over onto his back, he kicked upwards several times, aiming for the weak point in the top of the vent created by the Valkyr&#39;s slashing, hoping to create a shortcut into the space above.</span>

~The claws continued to shred the vent apart, and disappeared when Leveret&#39;s foot smashed through the top of the vent. On the other side of the vent, there was absolutely no light. Not a single light source here. The only source of light would be Leveret&#39;s flashlight. It was also eerily silent again, and there was no sign of Adrova or the Valkyr again. Clearly, they were rather adept at hiding.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Efhaz ducked down, scrambling to find cover. There was the fait sound of something being smashed, as Leveret broke through a vent, but that was followed by a split second of absolute silence. Then, a bright green projectile (They&#39;re casting Smite) appeared from a dark corner of the corridor, illuminating their assailant for an extremely short moment. It looked like an Oberon Warframe, but... different. The projectile moved toward Kapak very quickly, and looked like it would a lot of damage to both him and Efahz.~

~The next attack came from neither of those directions. Instead, a Kunai came from directly above Chegar, followed immediately by an oddly Loki-shaped shadowy figure lunging at him from the left, holding two Fang daggers, clearly about to do some stabbing.~</span>

As soon as the hole in the vent was large enough for him to climb through - <em>good thing I dumped the pelt</em> - Leveret clambered into the passageway above and looked around frantically for any sign of either the Valkyr or Adrova. Part of him hoped he’d find some kind of blood trail to follow, but what that entailed was something he hoped <em>wasn’t</em> the case. 

&quot;Get over here, you poxy Hyekka!&quot; he yelled into the darkness as he searched. Something in the back of his mind reminded him that splitting the group was 1) probably intentional on the valkyr&#39;s part and 2) a bad idea, but it only served to push him to move faster so he could find Adrova and return to the rest of the group.</span>

The Nidus groaned in annoyance as he extended his arm, his palm splitting open to reveal a tentacled ball of flesh festering within it. It shot out several tentacles as if firing off a volley of bullets. They found their way to Efahz, wrapping around the Corpus man before pulling him towards Kapak’s spot on the ceiling.
Kapak’s body seemed to explode almost, his flesh expanding and writhing in an unsettling fashion as he became almost like a protected bubble of flesh around Efahz.
“Hold on!” Kapak managed to say before the ball of radiation smacked into Kapak.
He cried out in pain as the energy melted through several layers of his flesh, the radiation ravaging his cells’ DNA. It hurt the Nidus a lot, but it was nothing he couldn’t handle.</span>

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Efahz, of course, struggled when Kapak grabbed and encompassed him. The assault didn&#39;t stop at the Smite, as the assailant leaped up from the shadows and slashed at Kapak with a Mire. In better lighting, it was confirmed to be an Oberon, but it looked... wrong. Twisted.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Several kunai were thrown again, but they weren&#39;t aimed at Chegar. They were aimed at the few remaining functional lights. The corridor became dark, giving Tarnas even more of an advantage.

~The moment Leveret had grabbed the Valkyr&#39;s wrist, and attempted to freeze her, he was knocked back with a staggering amount of force and would likely be momentarily stunned as the Valkyr shrieked again (Using Parlysis). The claws disappeared for a moment, and the room became pitch-black again. That was, until the claws reappeared, glowing orange, right beside Leveret as his assailant slashed again.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Efahz was very clearly still confused. Kapak was certainly weird. Kapak would be able to swing beyond the range of the flaming, radiation-poisoning floor of doom, seeing as it only covered the floor immediately below him. The Oberon, however, went for another attack, this time trying to stab through Kapak. They were, unfortunately, immune to the Hallowed Ground.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Man, right in the feels. Right as Tarnas was about to spin around for another attack, he stopped, dropping the scythe on the ground. Chegar&#39;s plan had clearly worked, as this twisted and mangled Loki stood there, shaking, looking at this illusion, clearly no longer interested in decapitating his foe.
&quot;But... dead... no...&quot; It was hard to discern what he had just said, as it sounded more like a series of weird growling noises than actual, normal speech. But he stood there, unmoving, staring. In other words, it&#39;s super effective.~</span>

His helmet-mounted light flickered out and he clamped his hands over where his ears would be. It took him a moment before he could force himself to move again, <em>get up, you&#39;ve got people to save.</em> His light flickered back on, and before he could even move to stand, he was greeted by the horrifying sight of the infestation-mangled Valkyr coming in with another strike.

Leveret yelled in surprise, letting out a burst of icy breath before dodging the attack with a last-minute roll to one side. It was hard to tell where his opponent was in the dark, but he kept the roll going in the hopes of bowling into her legs and potentially even pinning her.</span>

With his other hand, he reached around the Oberon&#39;s head, which he hopefully had been able to draw towards him with his first maneuver.

~Well, Leveret was in luck. He did manage to trip the Valkyr. Unfortunately, as Valkyrs tend to do, she was back on her feet almost immediately (gotta love that passive). But she didn&#39;t attack the likely-vulnerable Leveret. Instead, she backed off into a pitch-black corner. The claws reappeared again, illuminating his assailant. This time, though, there was something else illuminated. The Valkyr was carrying the unconcious Adrova now, the claws held less than an inch from his throat. She began backing away rather quickly down the corridor, carrying Adrova.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Everything went just as intended. The Oberon was disarmed, and the force of the knee being driven into his face knocking him back. He was stunned for a moment, as he tried to scramble back to his feet. He stretched out a hand, and a flash of green filled Kapak&#39;s vision as he became the target of another wave of radiation and pain. Followed up by another, and another, and yet another, as the Oberon smited Kapak four times in quick succession as a last-ditch effort, unless Kapak was somehow able to avoid this torrent of energy. The resulting projectiles, luckily, did not seek out Efahz. Instead, they all targeted Chegar, as he got near.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~&quot;NO! GET OUT! YOU&#39;RE DEAD!&quot; More shrieks can be heard from Tarnas. These actually sound closer to normal speech, and it seemed comphrehensible enough.
The sounds of battle could be heard up ahead, and the corridor would indeed lead Chegar to Kapak. What he saw was Efahz hiding in cover, Kapak kneeing a mangled and disfigured Infested Oberon, and several green projectiles flying toward him after the Oberon was knocked back onto the ground.~</span>

He hoped it would disorient a frame like the Valkyr, which clearly had incredibly keen senses. This was followed by a puff of gray mist from Leveret&#39;s helmet, and the icy armor spread to Adrova.

Instead of dashing forward in his warframe, however, Kinsey hopped free and void-dashed through the Valkyr and back again, trying to pull Adrova free in the return dash. They prayed the layer of ice would be enough to protect him until they could escape back to the rest of the group. Both dashes also left a trail of void-fire in their wake.</span>

&quot;Oh for Void&#39;s-&quot; Kapak fell to the floor as he grit his teeth and took the damage. The radiation would definitely take a toll on him until he could get back to his Orbiter and get a excisional DNA repair.
As soon as the blasts stopped, Kapak got back on his feet, shakily at first, but then he punched his palm and spat a glob of mucus from his skeletal jaw.
&quot;A light show? That&#39;s all you got, huh?&quot; He took a step forward and glanced around the room. His Torid was behind the Oberon, way too far out of reach. It might not even do him so much good. It was as good as gone at this point. Kapak would just tear this guy apart with his bare hands.
He took notice of the Nekros from the corner of his eye, although he was about to take a bunch of radioactive pellets to the face. He would probably be able to weather the attack, or at least Kapak hoped- as much as he enjoyed the thrill of combat by himself, he had learned to appreciate the help of others over the years. If he could keep his foe distracted long enough, Chegar might just be able to land a sneaky blow.
Kapak broke into a sprint before sliding onto the side of his thighs. Assuming Kapak could make it all the way uninterrupted, he would at the last moment kick off the ground, propelling himself upwards with a vicious roundhouse kick to the Oberon&#39;s head.</span>

He drew his sword, and sprung forward.  He lifted a hand above his head, and the spectral form of a dead Grineer soldier between Kapak and his foe. The Oberon projectiles slammed into the shadow, dispelling it immediately, but hopefully dampening the damage to the Nidus. Chegar brought his other hand above his head, gripping his nikana tightly as he prepared to bring it down on the Oberon&#39;s head.

In one fluid motion, Chegar swung the sword down. ~</div></span>

~The Valkyr fumbled with Adrova for a moment as the ice appeared and the pelt screamed, and attempted to finish him off with a quick slicing of the throat. Fortunately, the claws just scraped against the ice. The distraction was enough to for Kinsey to grab the still-unconcious Adrova. The fire left behind by the dash affected the Valkyr for a moment, leaving behind noticable burns,  she rolled to the side. Instead of engaging Leveret directly, though, she stood her ground as the claws reappeared. One set dug into the wall, and the other hand extended a ripline to the bottom of a stack of previously-hidden (stupid lack of light) crates in the corner of the room. With a pull of the ripline, the crates collapsed, clearly extremely heavy, as they slammed tumbled to the ground, covering up the entrance in the floor Leveret had used. With that, the glowimg claws were retracted again, and the Valkyr started backing up again, partially illuminated by the void fire, and emitted another high-pitched screech.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~The Oberon leaped to its feet, raising his hands to defend himself, still currently unarmed. Efahz was still hiding behind cover, letting Kapak deal with all of this. The Oberon moved a hand to deflect Kapak&#39;s kick. It stumbled backward, not quite able to withstand the force behind it. Right as Chegar showed up with his nikana.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Kapak was still hit by the initial torrent of radiation, but at least the projectiles were no longer a problem, right? The Oberon attempted to block the kick right before the slash, and stumbled right into the oncoming blade. It cleanly cut through the head, the neck, and a bit into the torso, the Frame offering little resistance against the blade. It fell to the ground, one side flopping a little bit as this <em>thing</em> hit the ground. Around it, though, just the sligtest bit of green energy appeared around it. Maybe it was just residual energy.~</span>

As soon as Adrova was safely out of the Valkyr&#39;s grasp, the pelt-free chroma took the place of the operator that had been barely big enough to hold up Adrova&#39;s unconscious body.

Leveret ducked and shielded Adrova with his body as the crates came crashing down, fully expecting them to topple on top of them. He looked up in surprise as the Valkyr retreated into the dark, the pelt delivering a final screech before returning to Leveret&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;YEAH MUCK OFF YOU POXXY HYEKKA! I&#39;LL BE BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF YOU LATER, JUST YOU WATCH!&quot; He yelled, allowing her to retreat into the dark for the moment. He backed towards the crates - yep, far too heavy to move on his own - and leaned Adrova against one.

&quot;Okay, I got him!&quot; Leveret blurted over the comms, &quot;Catlady&#39;s gone for now but Adrova&#39;s out cold and my way back is cut off. I&#39;ll try and find another way back.&quot;

Leveret crouched next to Adrova, dissipating the ice so he could check the man&#39;s back for any wounds or trace of infestation. The whole time, he glanced over his shoulders, doing a quick scan of the area around him. The last thing he needed was an ambush right now.</span>

&quot;HAHAAAAA! YES!&quot; Kapak cheered as he watched the shining blade slash through the Oberon.
&quot;Take this! <em>Ittitsuy</em>!!&quot; Kapak blindly and aggressively lept onto the damaged Warframe, straddling it and began to deliver rapid, prejudiced punches all over its crumpled body, with a focus on its skull. He didn&#39;t stop punching until he reached 30 vicious blows- that or if something else interrupted him.
Assuming Kapak managed to give out all of his furious attacks, he would finish the job by unhinging his jaw and biting what was left of the Oberon&#39;s mangled face.</span>

~The room fell eerily silent after a few moments, the only sounds being the constant dull whirring of the ship, the ever-present sounds of Infested, and Adrova breathing quietly. At least Adrova was breathing, right? He had a particularly nasty wound on his back, as a result of the ripline yanking him away. Nothing vital had been harmed, but everything was really messed up around that general area. There was also a small bit of Infestation on his uniform, but it was unclear if any of it had entered his body.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~After the <s>28 stab wounds</s> 30 bone-crushing attacks, and the bite, this Warframe was absolutely mangled. Barely recognizable at this point. Efahz had gotten out of his cover, and was staring at this bloodfest, clearly horrified. Elated that they had won, but horrified.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Well, it was gonna be a long way to the two of them. The most direct method (the vents directly above) had just been blocked off, and it was unknown when their paths would next converge. Before that could happen, though...~

<strong>KAPAK/CHEGAR</strong>
~The lights flickered, and seemingly from thin air, a bit further down the corridor, a certain Infested Loki appeared, still clutching the scythe. He was completely unmoving, merely staring at Chegar. His stance wasn&#39;t quite as threatening, but he still seemed ready to eviscerate something. Efahz started backing away slowly, fumbling for his gun.~</span>

“Rahm, that doesn’t look good...” Leveret muttered, inspecting the nasty wound thoroughly. “Okay, update,” he announced over comms as he put pressure on the wound, “Adrova got messed up by the ripline pretty bad. Uh...he’s breathing and I don’t see any of his organs? I don’t see any infestation yet either but it’s probably in there. He’s gonna need some patching up soon. I’m going down the hall to try and find another way back.”

“Okay, buddy, gonna get you out of here...” he muttered as he carefully slung Adrova over his shoulder, keeping pressure on the wound. Checking over his shoulder once more, he shifted the position of his unconscious friend on his shoulder and started down the forebodingly dark hall.</span>

“Umf it tasfes pretty gud.”
He stood up and swallowed, blood still dripping from his maw down his entire forefront.
“Ahh. Well, anyways, disposing as per your command,” he said as he passed by the Nekros. He snapped his fingers, and without warning, explosions erupted from within the deceased Warframe, engulfing the remains in a fiery ball.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about Adrova, just keep him alive and fixing him stays easy. The weird mucker down here&#39;s been neutralized, and no sign of other threats.&quot; Kapak responded to Leveret over the comms as he paced.
Kapak pauses however as he spots the Loki from over Chegar’s shoulder.

~As it turned out, navigating this horrifying, twisted hellscape of a ship is easier said than done. Even if Leveret knew enough about Corpus ships to make it back to the rest of the group, the collapsed portions and the walls of meat and technocyte made that next to impossible. Nothing made sense here. He was forced to go in certain directions by the Infested covering everything. It almost seemed to shift on the walls when he wasn&#39;t looking, as if it was responding to his movements.  As for Adrova, he wasn&#39;t doing too good. He was bleeding a bit more, and his breath was pretty irregular. That, and he was still unconcious.~

<strong>KAPAK &amp; CHEGAR</strong>
~As it turns out, this was <em>not</em> a decoy. Unfortunate. Efahz turned and ran toward Kapak, but not before Tarnas lunged and caught up. Well, that wasn&#39;t good. As Tarnas broke into a sprint, he shoved Efahz to the side. Efahz stumbled and ended up hitting a wall. The Loki continued running toward Kapak and Chegar, but seemed to disappear into thin air after a few seconds. Yeah, he can still cloak. Assuming Kapak didn&#39;t have some way of detectimg Tarnas, he would likely find two daggers embedded in his back moments after Tarnas cloaked.~</span>

Leveret hadn’t gone too far before realizing he was only going to get lost. He stopped to turn around, but before heading back, he noticed Adrova was getting worse.

<em>Muck muck muck shoulda done this earlier</em> he scolded, lowering Adrova to the ground and turning him so he had access to the nasty wound.

Kinsey stepped forward and crouched next to him, rubbing their hands together as they heated them up with void energy. “Probably for the best that you’re unconscious for this...” they muttered, pressing their searing hands into the wound.

“Guys he’s really not looking too good...” he said over comms, “he’s bleeding a lot and his breathing is starting to sound kinda mucked up. I tried to cauterize the wound but he needs help, like, <em>now.”</em> Leveret said, hugging his friend close to his chest for a moment as he spoke.

<em>Only way I’m getting back to the group is getting past those crates,</em> he realized. Carefully slinging Adrova over his shoulder once again, he turned to start backtracking to the place with the crates.

“You’re gonna be okay, buddy, you’re gonna be okay...” he muttered, more to himself than Adrova, starting to sound a bit uncertain.</span>

&quot;Okay, Leveret, just get down here and-&quot; Kapak&#39;s eyes would&#39;ve bugged out of his head if he had any. He was taken by surprise by the fact that that was not actually a decoy at all.
&quot;OH SHI- LET ME CALL YOU BACK OKAY!!?&quot; Kapak screamed into the comms before running forward with a ferocious roar, arms splayed out wide as he tried to catch Tarnas in a violent embrace. Of course, once Tarnas cloaked, Kapak&#39;s fingers wrapped around nothing except the stale air of the ship. Kapak would&#39;ve been able to smell out the diseased Loki if he had the time, but Tarnas was far too fast to pinpoint accurately, if at all.
The daggers found their way into Kapak&#39;s back, although that was nothing but a minor inconvenience to him. They stuck out, almost comically, the blood drawn by the sharp blades ceasing quickly as Kapak&#39;s flesh healed over the knives. He spun around with a hiss, his vision darting all around the room in an attempt to try and spot the Loki.</span>

~Adrova wasn&#39;t woken up by the cauterizing of his wounds. That was probably a bad sign. His breath got a bit more irregular as Leveret continued to carry him. It was clear he wasn&#39;t gonna last long. Before he could get too far, though, someone began speaking to him over comms. Someone familiar, unfortunately.
 &quot;It seems your friend is having some.. issues. This is why you don&#39;t bring a Corpus to an Infested fight, I suppose.&quot; Said the voice of none other than Clogori himself. &quot;Look, I&#39;ll cut to the chase. We both know he isn&#39;t gonna last long enough to get back to your accomplices. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, we&#39;re experts on biology. We can save him. Just come to us, and we&#39;ll do what we can. I can give you a location, if you agree.&quot;
So, Clogori was offering his help. In this twisted hellscape that he basically created. Probably not the most trustworthy. Then again, Adrova wasn&#39;t doing well in the slightest.~

<strong>KAPAK &amp; CHEGAR</strong>
~The ash both revealed the general location of Tarnas, and obscured the vision of pretty much everyone. There was a Loki-shaped shift in the ashes, as he lunged at Kapak from behind again, this time swinging his Imfested scythe through the Nidus&#39; torso. Tarnas clearly has lots of weapons on/in his person. He was moving extremely quick, clearly aiming to dispatch them as soon as possible. Efahz, meanwhile, was trying to regain his balance, and brush away the ashes obscuring his vision. He probably wouldn&#39;t be much help here, would he?~</span>

Every time Adrova&#39;s breathing faltered, it felt like Leveret&#39;s heart stopped. Somewhere along the line he&#39;d dropped his pelt to let him run faster. Blood pounded in his ears as he raced back the way he&#39;d came, the rushing of his heartbeat hardly serving to distract from his friend&#39;s plummeting condition. Clogori&#39;s voice was almost a welcome distraction. Almost. Too enraged by the situation to answer, Leveret muted the comm line before Clogori had even finished his sentence.

He hacked through infested tendrils to clear a better path as he all but sprinted back towards the hallway where he&#39;d fought the valkyr. He thanked the void that his internal map at least let him backtrack safely. He continued at a full sprint until at last he spied the toppled crates.

Fueled by rage and protective instinct, Leveret barreled into the crate covering the hole with every ounce of strength he could manage. He clutched Adrova&#39;s dying form to his chest as he rammed his shoulder into the crate again and again and again. The pure force of impact took out his shields and a vague, distant-sounding crunching noise marked what he dully realized was some of the mechanics in his shoulder breaking. His scream of rage mixed with the scraping sound that echoed down the hall in both directions as seconds of Adrova&#39;s life ticked away with every inch the crate moved.

&quot;CHEGAR IF YOU OR DOC DON&#39;T GET HERE NOW,&quot; Leveret all but screamed over the comms, &quot;ADROVA-&quot; SLAM &quot;IS GOING-&quot; SLAM &quot;TO DIE!&quot;</span>

Kapak coughed and hacked violently as the ashes from the air stuck to the inside of his throat- one disadvantage that he had over other Warframes. Lucky for them to not have any oral apertures!
“Voiddamnit you muckin Nekros!” Since Kapak was in the thick of it, he couldn’t make out a single blasted thing. He waved his arms crazily attempting to find something in the smoky swirl.
Upon Leveret screaming into the comms, Kapak couldn’t help but roll his eyes- well, he would be rolling them if they existed. Death was only a minor setback in terms of the possible healthcare the Nidus could deliver. It was annoying indeed, but in no way was it one hundred percent inhibitive.
If Adrova died, Kapak probably had half an hour to resuscitate him back to optimal health. 10 minutes if his wounds got infected.  And less than that depending on the degree of physical trauma on the Corpus’ body.
Kapak grumbled as he finally stumbled out of the ash and flopped onto the floor, next to Efahz.
“Oh, sup.” Kapak grinned.
“Let’s blow this gruk stand, eh? Hop on my back and let’s shove off- your friend went and goofed himself up it seems. Time to go clean up that mess!”
Kapak turned around and knelt down, offering his massive frame to Efahz for him to jump on.
“Leveret, listen here,” the Nidus spoke back into the comms, his voice suddenly shifting from its jolly demeanour to a now far more grim tone, “just keep Adrova’s body together as much as you can. If his heart rate drops under 20 BPM- yes, including 0- continue to protect the body from external damage. You hear me?”
Kapak called out to Chegar,
“And edgy-boi, you take care of the fathermuckin’ Loki, aight?!”</span>

~&quot;Last chance to reconsider. If you&#39;re quick, we might be able to help him. It&#39;s your last chance.&quot; Clogori taunted over a different comm channel. &quot;Do you really trust that Nidus friend of yours? How do you know he&#39;s going to help you?&quot;
The boxes were heavy, but no match for an angry Leveret. Adrova had the wind knocked out of him as Leveret rammed the crates, which clattered on the ground. The breach in the vent below became visible, as the containers covering it were all knocked aside. However, after a couple more breaths, Adrova didn&#39;t inhale again...~

<strong>KAPAK &amp; CHEGAR</strong>
~Kapak heard the sounds of clattering and/or smashing from above as Leveret crashed through the crates blocking his path to Kapak. Efahz was still trying to wipe the ash from his visor, and was unable to see Tarnas still. Speaking of Tarnas, he was nowhere to be seen again. However, a few meters away from the edge of the ashes (Sounds like an album name), three kunai were tossed directly up. It was unlikely anyone would notice them, and it did seem to be an odd tactic. That was, until Chegar found himself being switch-teleported with Tarnas, putting him even further  away from the vent and directly under three incredibly sharp kunai, all about to hit him. Now closer to Kapak, Tarnas swung his scythe at the Nidus again, a surprising amount of force behind the swing.~</span>

With the crates successfully cleared, Leveret went silent as Kapak gave instructions. He knelt next to the hole, still clutching Adrova&#39;s limp body to his chest. &quot;Okay....okay, I can do that. I-&quot; Leveret checked his friend just as he exhaled.....and failed to inhale. Seconds dragged on as he waited desperately for the inhale, but it didn&#39;t come. Safe in the Somatic Link, Kinsey felt all the blood drain from their face.

&quot;Doc, he&#39;s not breathing!&quot; Leveret cried over comms, shaking Adrova futilely. 
Not knowing what else do do, he laid Adrova on the ground and started chest compressions. Increasingly dreadful thoughts filtered through his head. Had his friend lost too much blood? Did he make this happen by slamming into the crates? Was he really making the right choice by choosing Chegar and the Plague Doctor instead of getting immediate help from Clogori? Sure, they were more trustworthy, but what if they didn&#39;t make it in time? <em>What am I going to tell his brother?</em>

&quot;Come on buddy....don&#39;t do this to me....&quot; he pleaded.</span>

He didn&#39;t see the scythe coming for the second time either. Now sporting two large gashes across his chest, as well as a mouth still filled with ash, Kapak sputtered and stumbled backwards away from Tarnas.
&quot;Hey look!&quot; Kapak snarled, &quot;a distraction!&quot;
The grotesque Warframe reached into his own wounds and pulled, pulling the flesh open to reveal his innards- which appeared to be the glowing eyes of at least a dozen maggots. With a squeal, a torrent of maggots, Kapak&#39;s hemolymph and other viscera poured from the wounds. The maggots rolled almost comically across the floor before righting themselves and charging towards the Infested Loki, howling high pitched shrieks and squishy noises.
Trying to take advantage of the distraction, Kapak grabbed Efahz, who was nearby, by the back of the helmet. Kapak&#39;s hands almost resembled the legs of a spider, the way they stretched and wrapped around the Corpus helmet. Once they did, Efahz would be firmly fixed to the end of the Nidus&#39; arm.
&quot;Don&#39;t annoy me,&quot; Kapak grumbled to Efahz, turning the Corpus to face his own, ugly visage before turning and beginning to jog as fast as his maimed body would let him.
&quot;Alright Leveret, listen here. Take Adrova and make your way to the hangar where you landed in. Quickly! No time to waste. He&#39;ll meet you there. Or hopefully he well. Just move!!&quot;</span>

&quot;On it!&quot; Leveret said, unceremoniously scooping Adrova up and leaping downwards into the vent. It was a tight fit, tighter still with Adrova in his arms. He managed to scramble through, contorting to keep from crushing his friend, the ache in his ruined shoulder growing more noticeable.

The pelt-less chroma tumbled free from the vent, landing on his feet and bending his knees to cushion the impact. The lifeless weight in his arms filled him with dread but he straightened and sprinted forwards, following his internal map back to the medical bay that they&#39;d discovered traces of the Valkyr in. <em>Through the vent to the room where Efahz was. Out the door, down the hall. Keep running. Keep running.</em>

Leveret couldn&#39;t remember the last time he&#39;d ran this fast. Never had the stakes been so dire before. He rehearsed the path back to the hangar over and over again, fully prepared to barrel through anything in his way as he sprinted towards his destination.</span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">~The three Kuni hit their mark, embedding into the Nekros&#39;s shoulders. Chegar faltered slightly, and his Nekros took a knee. It raised it&#39;s hand, a deathly shadow of the fallen Oberon rose from the ground, and proceeded towards Tarnas. A sudden streak of green void energy rippled across the as the Nekros lowered it&#39;s hand. Chegar appeared in a brief flash next to Leveret, soon vanishing as his warframe took his place. He waved his hand over Adrova, sparks of green Vazarin energy entering into his flesh.

The Kuni were still buried in Chegars &#39;frame, held fast by the Nekros&#39;s armor.
Attached to them, several small patches of infested biomass.
For the second time, One of Chegar&#39;s &#39;Frames had been infected. And only Now was Chegar realizing it.

&quot;Ah...Sh!t...&quot; Chegar breathed as it dawned on him what had happened ~</div>

~Luckily, nothing was getting in Leveret&#39;s way. Everything was exactly as it had been. Adrova, though, still wasn&#39;t breathing. His heart was no longer beating, and he had gone completely limp. For all intents and purposes, Adrova was dead. Here&#39;s hoping that Kapak knew what he was doing, right? Leveret was able to reach the hangar far faster than it had taken him to get as far into the ship as he was, now that he no longer had to worry about obstacles.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Still invisible, Tarnas stomped on one of the maggots. Well, he was invisible for a moment. Unfortunately for the Loki, though, his cloaking finally ran out. There he was in all of his ugly glory, swinging the Infested scythe at the approaching maggots as he backed up.
Efahz struggled, of course. What did you expect? He reached for the fingers now wrapped around his helmet, as if he were trying to pull them off. Giving up on that pretty quickly, he reached for the mechanism keeping his helmet, perhaps going to remove his helmet. When Kapak turned Efahz to face him, though, he gave up after Kapak told him to not be annoying.
&quot;Sorry, force of habit!&quot; Efahz apologized as he was dragged away by Kapak.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~The healing didn&#39;t do much to Adrova. He was already technically dead, anyway. That was probably the least of Chegar&#39;s problems, though. The growths expanded out from the three kunai, appearing slowly in the armor around the wounds. Well, that certainly wasn&#39;t good. There were no immediate changes resulting from this, but the growths already seemed to be getting out of control.~</span>

&quot;VILKAS OPEN THE RAMP!&quot; Leveret yelled, skidding to a stop in the hangar. His cephalon, sensing something was wrong, lowered the ramp to Leveret&#39;s mantis without a single snarky remark. Leveret hurried up the ramp and turned to look at Chegar, still clinging to Adrova&#39;s lifeless body. He couldn&#39;t feel Adrova&#39;s pulse through the suit, but something told him there wasn&#39;t one to feel.

&quot;Chegar you&#39;re- Dump your frame! Just dump it before it&#39;s too late!&quot; He cried, setting his friend&#39;s...body... on the ramp. Kinsey jumped forward with their hands already scorching hot, ripping the kunai from Chegar&#39;s back and chucking them as far away as possible. &quot;I&#39;ll try and handle this, just...go...go...&quot; their words faltered momentarily, but they hid their fear with a grimace. &quot;Go pump on Adrova&#39;s chest until Doc gets here.&quot;

Squashing back a sob, they continued trying to scorch the infestation from Chegar&#39;s warframe.</span>

Kapak sauntered jovially down the hallway with Efahz still tight in his grip.
&quot;So, this weirdo guy, uh, what was his name..... Alfonso...? Wait no, Chlorine, right?&quot; Kapak asked Efahz, shifting his arm so that he supported the Crewman in the most comfortable way possible, &quot;Some kinda mad scientist, eh?&quot;
He picked his teeth with his other hand, pulling out a stringy strand of tendon that must&#39;ve come from the Oberon.
&quot;Think I&#39;ll meet him? I mean, he&#39;s on this ship, right?&quot;

~In the meantime, a landing craft began to approach the hangar. It definitely wasn&#39;t a pretty one. It was covered in dents, looking as if whatever cephalon piloted it had just taken it on a joyride through an asteroid belt.  It entered the hangar, defty turning around one hundred-eighty degrees in a display that showed the shoddy craft still had the dexterity and maneuverability of any of the other better-looking landing crafts.
The ship dropped down to a lower elevation and extended its back ramp, revealing a dark interior.
All at once, a voice invaded the comms:

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-YOU ARE TO BOARD IMMEDIATELY. MY MASTER HAS INSTRUCTED ME THAT ONE OF THE ANCIENT FAMILY HAS BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED, AND HAS CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF LIFE AND DEATH. PLEASE, PROCEED ABOARD THIS VESSEL.</div>

A flicker of light seemed to flash from within the darkness, briefly illuminating the interior of the Landing Craft before fading back into shadows.~</span>

Kinsey abandoned the job of scorching Chegar&#39;s frame, jumping back into their own and summoning their pelt. It took a while to arrive, having been abandoned somewhere deep in the ship. By the time it reformed on Leveret&#39;s back, he&#39;d already scooped up Adrova&#39;s body and grabbed Chegar by the arm, dragging him into the lander. &quot;Y-yeah he has.

~Well, it&#39;s not like Adrova can get much worse. Leveret is basically dragging around a dead body at this point. Short of getting thrown in a meat grinder, he was probably as bad as he was gonna get. Luckily, nothing was attacking him, still. Either he was lucky, or they were intentionally not going after him. All that was really left at this point was whatever Kapak was planning here.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~&quot;Uh, his name is Clogori. Yeah, he&#39;s somewhere.&quot; Efahz responded, actually not too panicked by this. &quot;Can&#39;t let me walk on my own, or something?&quot; He asked, noting Kapak&#39;s saunter.
The corridor was dead quiet, even the squelching of the growths everywhere stopping or becoming far quieter. That was certainly unusual. The growths always seemed to be moving around, but they were completely and absolutely still.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~The growths continued appearing and expanding around the spots where the kunai had hit Chegar. It was growing quickly, and a couple small tendrils were starting to appear. This was almost definitely very concerning, and starting to get a bit out of control at this point.~</span>

Vague, twisted, pulsating shapes seemed to shift in the shadows. Golden spores flit about, giving the dark moody ship a bizarre, nightmarish and yet fantastical atmosphere.
The voice spoke again, creating another flicker of red light coming from everywhere, it seemed- still not enough to illuminate the ship properly.~

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-WE MUST WAIT HERE FOR OUR MASTER TO RETURN. YOU WILL BE SAFE HERE, FOR NOW.</div>

There was silence for a moment, as if the mysterious, disembodied voice was staring at Leveret from the shade.
Then, red light poured down from the ceiling in a column, illuminating a glass-bubble style hazardous material mask sitting on the seemingly inactive codex module. Something weird and veiny quickly pulled out of view of the crimson spotlight when it lit up, but the mask remained.~

The voice spoke with conviction. It was hard to tell how it knew the true name of the operator behind the Warframe, and also why the voice seemed to say it with a familiar tone. Then again, it was hard to read any emotions from such a strange sound- the voice resembled that of an entire choir of whispering voices, compiled into a loud and bass voice; yet it sounded so empty when it spoke.

&quot;But what if I got hungry?&quot;
After letting Efahz soak in the words for five whole seconds, Kapak threw his head back and unhinged his jaw, letting out a hearty bellow. He laughed and laughed, and probably would have had tears streaming down his face if he had eyes.
&quot;I&#39;m just muckin&#39; about. I&#39;m keeping you where you are in case of any more mutant weirdo Warframes pop out of nowhere. This way, they&#39;d have to hack my arm off just to steal you away.&quot;
Kapak continued to happily skip down the hallway, only a few meters away from the hangar now. He didn&#39;t seem to notice or mind the unnerving silence... was he just not paying attention? Or was he just confident to the point of not caring about anything? He was dead serious about Adrova&#39;s state just a moment ago!

The frost nodded once, slipping the straps of the mask over one arm. He stepped about carefully until he found a relatively bare section of floor and sank to the ground crosslegged, cradling Adrova in his lap.

&quot;How did you know I go by Kinsey?&quot; He asked, staring at the vague shapes on the dark ceiling. He itched to turn on his headlamp, but it felt as though doing so would put everything at risk. <em>Everything IS at risk,</em> he realized, looking down at his friend&#39;s lifeless body in his arms. Adrova&#39;s blood had already begun to dry on his hands, and he resolved to scrub them clean the moment he got the chance. Perhaps a full scrubdown of his entire frame would do. 

&quot;Doc, I hope you&#39;re picking up the pace. It&#39;s bad news over here. Chegar&#39;s infected and Adrova...he&#39;s...not doing any better. I made it to your lander but...I don&#39;t know.

(Nothing for me to describe, oof. Jado might have to post first again)

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
&quot;Is it just me... or did everything get <em>really</em> quiet?&quot; Efahz noted as they entered the hangar. &quot;It doesn&#39;t seem to be as... squelch-y. That&#39;s probably not normal.&quot; Efahz did his best to keep walking on his own, but was kinda alright with letting Kapak handle this. Leveret seemed to trust him, so he was probably fine. Besides, there was now nothing between them and the ships in the hangar.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~Right before Kapak entered the hangar, several tendrils burst from the growths and wrapped around Chegar&#39;s arms. That was probably the least of his concerns, though. Chegar could hear a... voice. Just a small whisper at the back of his mind. No particular words were distinguishable, but it was telling him to do one thing: leave. This voice seemed perfectly reasonable and logical enough to him, and he would likely find part of himself agreeing with it. The catwalks above. Go up there. Proceed into the vents. Do not contact anyone else.~</span>

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;Oh, sure sure,&quot; Kapak&#39; answered Leveret over the comms, &quot;we&#39;re just at the hangar now. I went as fast as I could!&quot; He grinned at Efahz like he told the world&#39;s funniest joke.
&quot;And yeah, I got Efuzz with me. Don&#39;t worry!&quot;
Kapak paused as he listened to his surroundings.
&quot;Hmm, yeah, it&#39;s pretty quiet. It smells... about the same. Hard to say whether or not we&#39;re in any danger, but I guess time will tell, heh!&quot;
Kapak stepped into the hangar, and took note of the lack of enemies.
&quot;Well, that&#39;s awfully nice! No enemies here to try and stop us!&quot; Kapak unhooked his fingers and softly set the Corpus onto the floor by his two feet.
&quot;Let&#39;s go now, we gotta go and um, deal with your friend&#39;s minor case of, uh, not-alive. No worries though, all we have to do is go swing by my Orbiter and then we can return here and try to kick Cloregno&#39;s arse!&quot;
The Nidus marched forward, waving two fingers behind his head, signalling Efahz to follow him to the open ramp at the back of a very, very rundown looking landing craft.</span>

&quot;Okay. Good.&quot; He relaxed slightly. At least Efahz was safe, for now.

&quot;Operator? What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked the voice of his own Cephalon, cutting in suddenly enough to make the nervous Frost flinch. Hearing voices in the hangar, Leveret leaned forward to peer down the open ramp. &quot;Shut up Vilkas! I don&#39;t have time!&quot; he hissed in response.

&quot;Doc, that better be you in the hangar!&quot; he called.</span>

The Nidus poked his head into the ship with a toothy grin, hopefully startling Lev in the process.
&quot;Hiya!&quot; He said with a wave.
&quot;I have arrived, right on time! Earfaz, let&#39;s move it!&quot; As Kapak&#39;s foot crossed the threshold of the ship&#39;s ramp, the darkness of the Liset&#39;s interior lit up- but only by very dim lights. It was, however, enough to see the grotesque innards of the Landing Craft.</span>

&quot;Uh...Hi.&quot; Leveret responded, standing slowly and looking around. He looked a little overwhelmed by what all was going on. He stared wordlessly at the inside of the lander, then to Efahz who had - thankfully - followed the Nidus inside. The Chroma gave a nod to his other crewman friend. &quot;Glad to see you&#39;re...still okay.&quot; he said quietly.

&quot;I...wait, what about Chegar! Wasn&#39;t he just outside?&quot;</span>

~Efahz looked around, still unsure about what was going on. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Where&#39;s Adrova? Can someone tell me who the Nidus is?&quot; He was confused, and just got dragged halfway across a ship, so this was an expected reaction. He looked around the ship again, stumbling a bit. &quot;And- <em>why is there so much Infested in this ship?</em>&quot;</span>

The mutant grin on his face dropped into a pouty frown since Leveret didn&#39;t seem to get spooked by him. Ah well, next time, perhaps.
&quot;Of course Efahz is okay, he was with me! No one safer to be with!&quot; Kapak thumped his chest with pride before glancing back behind himself.
&quot;Chegar...? No, he wasn&#39;t... he wasn&#39;t in the hangar. Why? Was he supposed to make it back?&quot; Kapak scratched his chin before turning back to Efahz, placing a boney hand over the Crewman&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Adrova&#39;s... right there.&quot; He pointed to the body lying in the Chroma&#39;s arms. &quot;At least, most of him is still in here. Told you, he&#39;s got a mild case of the death. Speaking of which, bring him over here.&quot;
Kapak motioned to Leveret to bring the body towards him. In the meantime, the ship began to vibrate softly, a sign that it was preparing to take off. The ramp had already closed behind Kapak&#39;s steps.
&quot;I gotta pump some oxygen through his brain real quick, otherwise he might lose some... well, basically all of his memories.&quot;</span>

&quot;Yes, very important,&quot; Kapak said as he lifted Adrova into his own arms and produced a wriggling, leech-like worm from his wrist.
&quot;If you inhale any of these pretty gold spores you see floatin&#39; around, you will die a very painful and slow death- I mean, I could probably fix you, but you don&#39;t want to annoy me with more work now, do you? Otherwise I might... make a mistake. And trust me, I usually don&#39;t.&quot;
The leech-like tube convulsed for a moment before moving itself upwards and towards Adrova&#39;s chest. An icky, clear, viscous sludge dripped from its tip, the tooth covered end pulsating like some kind of living drillhead. Swiftly and without hesitation, Kapak flexed his wrist, and the tube punctured Adrova&#39;s chest.
&quot;Just attaching this little fellow to my own circulatory system,&quot; Kapak said as the ship began to move away from the hangar. &quot;Well, not completely. Can&#39;t have my infested erythrocytes running around inside his capillaries now, can we? I&#39;m just injecting oxygen into his aorta and also applying some nice pressure to get the blood flowing. Keep his brain slightly active, you know?&quot;
Kapak gave a thoughtful frown. &quot;He&#39;s probably lost anywhere from 10 minutes to a whole hour of his memories at this point. Hard to say, different with everyone. Guess we&#39;ll see when I&#39;m through- and yes, you could say I&#39;ve done this before.&quot;
The Nidus&#39; boney plating opened outwards, revealing swaying stalks of Infested bronchioles. Kapak was using them to absorb more oxygen.</span>

&quot;I...I tried to do some chest compressions when he first stopped breathing but I had to stop and keep moving,&quot; Leveret said, settling on the floor with Adrova&#39;s helmeted head in his lap. He did his best to keep still to prevent jostling Kapak&#39;s work, which looked like it could be delicate. It was spooky, seeing the lights of Adrova&#39;s helmet staring blankly up at him. Leveret looked at the Nidus to distract himself.

&quot;You have done this before. Not that I doubted you, but it&#39;s reassuring. What happened, the last time you did this? Do they wake up suddenly, or...?&quot;

Leveret wasn&#39;t sure what it would be like. He half expected Adrova to suddenly sit up and wheeze, or his fingers to give a dramatic, ever-so-slight twitch.</span>

&quot;Oh, this alone won&#39;t save him,&quot; Kapak said calmly as the Landing Craft cruised through the debris fields of Eris. Again, another surprising  demonstration of the cruddy-looking ship&#39;s deftness. The ride was quite smooth, actually.
&quot;Once we get to my Orbiter, I&#39;ll have to, well. Open him up, shall we say.&quot; Kapak waved his opposite hand up and down over Adrova&#39;s torso.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s exactly wrong with him at the moment, other than being dead. But once I&#39;m through, it&#39;ll be just like Androo here&#39;s just waking up from a long nap.&quot;</span>

&quot;...Oh. Um. Well there is that nasty wound on his back. He was bleeding a lot, too. I tried to cauterize it? But I may have done it too late. Could it be shock? That&#39;s a thing that happens, right?&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Kapak waved and smiled apologetically, &quot;it could be any number of things, seen or unseen. Hemorrhagic shock, possible. Poison possibly too. Perhaps even some kind of trauma to the head. Hard to say for now, but believe me, I WILL find out.&quot;
Kapak glanced forward out the viewport, casually flicking away an Infested Maggot that was sniffing Efahz&#39;s boots.
&quot;Ah, here we are! Home sweet home. I&#39;d suggest putting that mask on now, by the way.&quot; Kapak tapped the mask on Leveret&#39;s arm.
The ship pulled up in front of a familiar sight- a Tenno orbiter, although it was just as dented and banged up as the landing craft they were in. The Liset turned away from the Orbiter as it reversed into its docking place.</span>

<strong>Kinsey</strong>
Holding their breath and leaning backwards, Kinsey half-fell half-rolled out the back of their warframe, leaving the Chroma crosslegged with Adrova&#39;s head still resting in its lap. They slipped the mask on and released the breath they&#39;d been holding. The tenno grimaced as they took in the unique smell of the liset. &quot;Is Adrova gonna need a mask? I dunno how the seals in Corpus suits work but there&#39;s a big hole in the back of his.&quot;</span>

&quot;Alright. Remember! Keep that mask on.&quot;
The ramp at the back of the Landing Craft lowered, and Kapak scooped up Adrova fully into his arms and marched inside.

There would only be a brief moment to take in the interior of Kapak&#39;s nightmarish-yet-whimsically fantastic Orbiter before an enormous, red holographic eye materialized from nowhere, shoving itself into the Tenno&#39;s face.

&quot;Just fill up that vial with a little pick of the finger,&quot; Kapak said sheepishly, shuffling Adrova in his arms as a bizarre... thing descended from a sphincter in the ceiling. It was like a scorpion tail almost, but with an array of testtubes fused onto the end of it. There was also a pointy needle sticking out to the side.
&quot;Sorry that ol&#39; Helminth here is so cryptic and macabre. Back in the old days we used to provide a sharp object to let people cut their own hands, but having to wash, sterilize and then repackage the blades all the time got tiresome. So we just created a lil&#39; picky thing made of a platinum-auroxium alloy. It&#39;s got great antimicrobial properties &#39;n stuff. Hurry now! Time&#39;s wasting!&quot;</span>

&quot;Hey, personal space, man!&quot; The tenno yelped angrily, waving a hand through the hologram as though to push it back.

Looking sheepishly at the needle, Kinsey reached out and pricked their finger on the needle, squeezing some blood into one of the vials.

&quot;Given that you said Demon, I&#39;m assuming you only need some from me, so there you go.&quot;

Kinsey again grabbed Efahz by the wrist and tugged him along, ducking past the scorpion-tail thing and avoiding the intrusive holographic eye.

&quot;Uh. Hey, Efahz? You might not wanna watch this. I might not either. You wanna wait elsewhere or something? I&#39;ll stay with you.&quot;</span>

~&quot;Wh... what&#39;re you doing with Adrova? Is he gonna be alright?&quot; Efahz was constantly looking around, very clearly paranoid and anxious. This was a ship full of Infested stuff, after all. &quot;What&#39;s gonna happen? Can you save him?&quot; Efahz stayed close to Kinsey, but kept his distance from the weird scorpion tail thing.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Adrova was extremely seriously injured (besides being dead, of course). He&#39;s lost a lot of blood from the wound on his back, most of it pooling in his boots at the moment. Yep, his boots are full of blood. Not only that, but his spine&#39;s been pretty seriously messed up, fractured in a couple of places around the wound. Worst of all, though, it would seem that there was Infested growths starting to appear around the wound. So, yeah. Not good.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~A specific voice could be discerned now. A single voice, seperated from the seemingly endless whispering. <em><strong>&quot;You must not return to them. They will think you are dangerous. Just continue ahead. You will come to a room containing a single empty crate. Enter it when you reach it. More shall be explained.&quot;</strong></em> This voice sounded almost impossibly trustworthy and reasonable.  It seemed like it knew what it was talking about. Why would it possibly ever lie to Chegar?</span>

He might not be 100% but I think.....yeah, I think he&#39;ll probably be alright? I mean, you saw how fast he fixed your leg. You&#39;re gonna be okay. I&#39;m right here.&quot;

Of course, Kinsey wasn&#39;t even as certain as they sounded. They didn&#39;t want to scare Efahz, though. He was freaked out enough already. Hoping to comfort him, Kinsey took hold of Efahz&#39;s hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. They immediately felt awkward about it, since they&#39;d only ever comforted Grineer this way, and realized they could very well be sending the wrong message. Still, Efahz needed something to ground himself before he freaked out any more, and it was the only thing they could think to do.</span>

Kapak&#39;s glowing boils grew increasingly bright as the mutated Warframe was overcome with alarm.
&quot;There&#39;s.... a.... lot of blood. OUTside his body. Oh void.... oh void oh void!!!&quot; Kapak turned and sprinted down the left back ramp of the Orbiter, descending down the the lower level.
Kapak&#39;s muffled voice called out as he ran:
&quot;That means I&#39;ve been pumping jack diddly through this fathermucker&#39;s veins! MUUUUUUUU- HELMINTH, INFIRMARY DOORS! STAT!!&quot;
Suddenly from (seemingly) nowhere, two squat little creatures charged past the Corpus and operator, shrieking and gargling strange bestial noises.... was one of the carrying a laminated bag of towels??

~Efahz just sorta stumbled along behind Kinsey, being dragged along. His hand was hurting a bit now, but it was hopefully temporary. &quot;Wait, he was bleeding? Oh God, it&#39;s probably all in his boots now.&quot; Clearly, Efahz has experienced this before, or has seen others experience it. &quot;It all just sorta pools there after a while.

As the two outsiders descended to the lower level, they were met with the sight of Kapak standing and waiting next to two... infested things?... standing attentively next to him while a bizarre looking contraption opened up. It was some kind of airlock, obvious installed into Kapak&#39;s orbiter after being cannibalized from some Corpus frigate. Once fully open, it revealed a chamber within, flooded with an ominous red light.
&quot;Alright, everyone who&#39;s coming inside, step in, step in! It&#39;s a tight squeeze, but room for all! Let&#39;s go!&quot; Kapak gestured for the others to come in as he stepped inside the airlock alongside the little minion-esque creatures and Adrova&#39;s body.
&quot;If you don&#39;t want to watch the operation, stay out here, don&#39;t touch anything... but lemme tell you, no masks needed inside here!&quot; Kapak nodded with his head to the unseen room behind the airlock.</span>

Even as they decided aloud, Kinsey sounded uncertain. They couldn&#39;t bare the idea of Adrova along in the room without anyone but the spooky Nidus and his helpers. Sure enough, they shook their head and straightened. &quot;I....muck it, I&#39;m going in. Come on buddy.&quot;

Once again Kinsey gently pulled Efahz along, squeezing into the airlock and making sure to leave room for Efahz. &quot;You&#39;ll be able to take your helmet off,&quot; they whispered to him, &quot;It&#39;ll be less claustrophobic, yeah?&quot;</span>

~&quot;Oh man, the blood is gonna make a mess... don&#39;t remove the boots unless you can clean up blood.&quot; Efahz honestly didn&#39;t seem <em>super</em> worried about Adrova. After all of the stuff he&#39;s seen Kapak doing, reviving the dead hardly seemed impossible. Kapak&#39;s odd behavior was probably normal for him, right? &quot;Doc, is he gonna be alright?&quot; He asked quietly, following Kinsey into the likely very creepy operating room.~</span>

Whoever was unlucky enough to be squished next to Kapak would be able to hear his weird external heart-like organ thumping and see it emit light as it pulsated.
When the airlock gas cleared and the doors finally opened, it revealed... well, nothing short of a standard infirmary found on any other Orbiter. But this one had been modified. The fluid pipes and bizarre chair that usually occupied the center of the room were missing, obviously removed from their normal spot. Additionally, there was much less Infestation growing on the walls here compared to the rest of the ship- the air was <em>clean</em>, lacking in the presence of amber spores that were floating around both the Landing Craft and the rest of the Orbiter.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
As Kapak approached the center of the room, a flat, white slab supported by some neatly arranged Infested sinew descended from the ceiling. Kapak laid Adrova&#39;s body upon the table quickly and rushed off to the back of the room, his heels clicking over the glass floor of an underfloor aquarium.
&quot;Just store your helmets off to the left side of the airlock,&quot; Kapak called out while his two minions began to run around the room, picking up tools and moving them around to various places. One of them dropped a the laminated bag of towels on the edge of the white table next to Adrova&#39;s body before hurrying off back into the airlock and disappearing.
The Nidus began to rummage around through a variety of Corpus storage crates, grabbing various tools and jars of material as a bizarre spider-like Infested monster began to shuffle slowly towards Efahz.</span>

~Efahz was able to get his helmet off fairly easily on his own. He was looking rather pale and incredibly, incredibly anxious/worried. Adrova was possibly in danger, after all. That&#39;s when he saw the thing shuffling toward him. He panicked at first, as evidenced by his &quot;OHMYGODWHATISTHATWHYISITCOMINGTOWARDME-&quot; as he jumped back a bit. Nope, still not used to the Infested.~</span>

&quot;Oluth! Over here, you blind garbage bag!&quot; Kapak turned and walked back over to Adrova&#39;s side, snickering to the two as he passed by.
&quot;Sorry about that, Oluth is, well, blind. He&#39;s an important tool in my operations, but he doesn&#39;t need eyes, so I haven&#39;t given him any.&quot;
The spider-like lump of flesh turned and shuffled towards the sound of Kapak&#39;s voice, stopping right beside the slab.
&quot;Also, meet Petrisis and Mephalus,&quot; Kapak introduced the two other monkey emulating organisms hurrying about the room. &quot;They&#39;ll be helping me during this exp- excuse me, procedure.&quot;
Kapak waved over the taller of the two creatures (Mephalus) to his side, making a twirling sign with his finger. Mephalus barked some outlandish growls to Petrisis, and the two creatures jumped onto the table. Mephalus, at the head, unhooked the helmet after fumbling clumsily with it, exposing the very, very pale face of Adrova.</span>

Oluth belched loudly as what sounded like machinery began to growl from within the depths of its bulbous, bumpy body. In the meantime, Petrisis had unzipped the Corpus jumpsuit and was now pulling it with all its might to de-clothe the Corpus body.
&quot;Hey, dingus! Don&#39;t do that! You&#39;ll mess up the wound! We&#39;re gonna have to turn him and lie him on his stomach, then cut off the clothes. We&#39;ve done this before you daft cuck!&quot; Kapak slapped the creature and it waved its arms, trying to steady itself- unsuccessfully of course. It landed on the glass floor with a thunk.
Kapak, now done fingering Adrova&#39;s mouth, brandished a test tube that he&#39;d grabbed earlier from the boxes of supplies in his back room. It, like majority of the other tools in the theatre, were surprisingly clean. The Nidus&#39; finger warped and twisted as he pushed it deep, to the bottom of the glassware.
&quot;Cell sample, Andrew Vah&#39;s inner cheek.&quot; He said as-a-matter-of-factly, briefly showing it off to his observers.
He began to walk towards Oluth.</span>

The Nidus stopped before Oluth as the organism opened its maw, exposing a cavernous cavity behind its jaggedly toothed jaws. The flesh glowed a subtle magenta, identical to the glowing pustules on Kapak&#39;s body. Almost haphazardly, Kapak tossed the glass container into the creature&#39;s mouth, and Oluth clamped down on it.
&quot;Plasma done?&quot; Kapak asked it.
Oluth burped and grumbled.
Without hesitation, Kapak had crossed the room, grabbed an IV bag &amp; an intravenous needle with a tube, and crossed back over. He hooked the IV bag onto the golden metal bars sticking out of Oluth&#39;s head, obviously reminiscent of some medical contraption created by the Orokin. Kapak reached into a sphincter on Oluth&#39;s back, a loud sucking sound being produced as he wrapped his hands around an intestine-like tube with a metal cuff. He tugged on the tube and attached it to a one-way seal on the side of the deflated IV bag, and almost immediately a vast volume of yellowish, soupy fluid filled the plastic.
&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Kapak complimented the living device as he took the needle and plugged it into Adrova. It wasn&#39;t going to help fully, but it was better than nothing- Kapak would have to synthesize Adrova&#39;s blood.

It was a tough job, but the little guys had managed. The two of them stared at the wound, their expressionless eyes gazing at the mess of a back on the Corpus&#39; body. Mephalus dragged a long finger across the wound and licked it with a slimy, thin tongue. Petrisis hissed and slapped the other creature in return.
&quot;Muckers! Do NOT eat the patient! Mephalus, there&#39;s still that dead Ostron bounty hunter in the walls somewhere, why don&#39;t you go eat that instead?!&quot;
While Mephalus grumbled under its breath, Kapak paused and looked behind himself at his spectators.
&quot;How about you guys? Hungry? I can have someone fetch you some food. Perhaps some condroc wings? Maybe pickled fooshaw? Oh! I might have some Martian oasis jellyfish in the cold storage!&quot;

&quot;Suit yourselves,&quot; he spoke as he returned his attention to the body on the table. He cracked his knuckles loudly as the grin disappeared from his face, settling into the unsettling, emotionless smile that skulls usually bore.
Kapak held up his index and middle finger as if making a finger gun, twirling once before digging them into the flesh next to the intravenous needle. After a moment he pulled his fingers out, leaving behind a relatively large gash on the side of the neck.
&quot;250 CCs of H-Technocyte lymphatic fluid administered to subject,&quot; Kapak announced, but seemingly to no one in particular. Perhaps he was keeping mental note?
Kapak picked a piece of calcified flesh from the back of Adrova, hardened from the presence of the Infestation that had contaminated the wound. He popped the piece into his mouth and chewed it before spitting the piece out into his hand. He sniffed it over once, and then threw it back into his mouth, this time swallowing it.
&quot;Analyzing phospholipid bilayer of Infested cells.&quot; Kapak exhaled and snapped his fingers. &quot;Secreting pheromones. H-Technocyte antigens changing.&quot;
He returned to Oluth&#39;s mouth, which opened to welcome the mutant Warframe.
&quot;Material ready?&quot; He asked the creature. It grunted in acknowledgement. &quot;Excellent. Mephalus, ready the Malicious.&quot;
With a quirky little salute, the Infested Monkey leapt onto the side of the wall, scaling up it until it disappeared into the ceiling.</span>

Quickly losing track of all the fancy words Kapak was using, Kinsey settled for wrapping an arm around Efahz and giving him a gentle side-hug. &quot;Looks like it&#39;s going alright so far,&quot; they whispered, both to Efahz and to themself. They glanced sideways at their friend. He wasn&#39;t taking this very well so far. Kinsey wished they had a blanket or something to give him, but a hug would have to suffice for now.</span>

The Nidus peered over the wounds of Adrova, and thankfully the Infested tissue was beginning to glow- normally this would be alarming, but in this case, it meant Kapak&#39;s own homebrew TNK cells were doing their job.
A scorpion-like appendage lowered itself from the ceiling, very similar to that of the weird claw that had accepted blood from Kinsey earlier. Kapak once more grabbed Oluth&#39;s intestinal tube, this time hooking it into some kind of machine that was fused to the back of the fleshy, carapaced stinger.
With one more crack of his knuckles, Kapak said, &quot;Alright Helminth. Let&#39;s save this soul.&quot;
The stinger-claw-thing swung down like a scythe, embedding itself into Kapak&#39;s right shoulder. There was a hissing sound, followed by a humming noise as the veins along Kapak&#39;s arm&#39;s flesh began to bulge.
&quot;Various tissues from the Crewman&#39;s body have been successfully synthesized. Helminth, switch me to osseous tissue, please.&quot;
There was a clunk as a revolving cylinder on the back of the claw rotated. Kapak straight away set to work with grim determination. His hands morphed into various shapes and sizes, each fitting different purposes that were required- first, his right hand phased into a crab claw-like appendage as he began to snip and cut away at the mangled tissue. He cut out the entirety of the exposed backbone as well as majority of the cauterized tissue. Then, his hand seemed to shift shapes yet again, this time becoming some strange kind of organic, living pipette. Layer by layer, the Nidus deftly, carefully, but also quickly recreated the shapes of the vertebrae. Almost every second, he spoke another command to Helminth to switch tissue types- white matter, grey matter, osseous, skeletal muscle, connective... the list went on. Kapak&#39;s fingers danced over the body like a harpist playing a melody, or a tapistrier creating woven art. Soon enough, Adrova&#39;s back looked- well, still open and bloody, but at least it was now anatomically correct!</span>

~Efahz wasn&#39;t really responding to anything Kinsey was saying and/or doing at this point. He had a rather blank expression on his face, not even looking at Adrova. He wasn&#39;t looking at anything in particular, just looking... expresionless. That was probably a bad thing.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~The vent eventually dropped down into a room clearly uses to contain cargo and supplies. It seems to have been mostly cleared out, though. There was indeed a single crate in the room, attached to a rail above it (Y&#39;know those rails in Corpus ships). It was just as empty as the rest of the dimly-lit room, and the lack of light made it impossible to tell where the rail even went.
&quot;<em><strong>You may doubt the instructions, but your best interests are in mind. Enter the crate. It will take you somewhere safe. Trust me.</strong></em>&quot; It seemed the more Chegar doubted the voice, the louder and more distracting it became. It still sounded very persuasive, and Chegar would have a hard time resisting it.~</span>

&quot;Alright, now that most of his back should work properly again, let&#39;s take a look at that brain.&quot; Kapak raised his bloody, slimy hands and waved helplessly.
&quot;CAN SOMEONE GET ME A VOIDDAMN TOWEL?!&quot; he yelled. Alas, all of his helpers were preoccupied at this time.
Mephalus was pushing some kind of ancient Orokin medical monitor across the room. It was comprised of a large, transparent sheet of glass (presumably the screen) and a (once) golden base. Inscribed on the bottom of the glass&#39; frame was the word &#39;electroencephalograph&#39; in Orokin. Mephalus unhooked a pair of pads connected to wires from the machine and placed them on Adrova&#39;s temples.
Petrisis was down on its hands and knees, scrubbing away at the stray splashes of blood that had leaked from Adrova&#39;s suit after they had cut it off of the crewman.</span>

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Kapak thanked coldly, almost as if we was angry at the poor operator! &quot;More useful than my own guys.&quot;
He snatched the towel out of the Tenno&#39;s hands and spun about, turning his attention back to the medical slab while wiping his hands off. He tossed the (once) white (and now pinkish) towel to the side and commanded &quot;Helminth, erythrocytes .&quot;
With another whirr of the barrel, Kapak&#39;s hands and arm began to develop bulging veins once more. He made a fist, and a needle-like bone spike formed from the boney knuckles of his mutant hand. He inserted it carefully after measuring some invisible, unseen lines, deep, deep into Adrova&#39;s flesh.
&quot;Giving blood now,&quot; he commented. &quot;Petrisis, go let Mr. Chub- I mean, Gethar. We&#39;re gonna need to jumpstart this guy soon, so you know what that means.&quot;
Petrisis squeaked and ran past Efahz, stopping to pat the deadeyed Corpus with its lanky arms on the head before continuing out and into the airlock.
Mephalus glanced at the Orokin sensor machine and then back at the body. It burbled.
&quot;Well, now we just sit here for a while. Adroowa&#39;s body is going to be ok in this state for a little while, since I&#39;m pumping blood through it and also manually regulating his organs with my technocytes,&quot; Kapak said, turning back to Kinsey, &quot;I&#39;ll warn you, if he makes it, he&#39;s going to have at least a 50% increased risk of cancer thanks to how long his organs have been oxygen starved.&quot;</span>

The tenno, tiny in comparison to the Nidus, nodded quickly. &quot;I-I&#39;ll be sure to let him know. Uh. Is he gonna be okay, do you think?&quot; they mumbled, staring at Adrova&#39;s lifeless body on the table. He looked so small without his suit on.

The Nidus stood there, almost awkwardly, with his fingers stuck in Adrova&#39;s open, fleshy back. If Kinsey looked close enough, he might&#39;ve noticed the muscles rising and falling- it was incredibly shallow, but there!
&quot;Well, um, let me see...&quot; Kapak looked at his left hand and counted out something on his fingers. &quot;Six years ago was my last, um &#39;resurrection&#39; case, shall we call it. That&#39;s why I&#39;m pretty rusty... anyways, it was a band of Solaris United who were smuggling out a family of debtors from that frozen hellscape Anyocorp throws them all into. The patriarch of the family, he took a shot off the side of the dome and his circuits were fried to Void.&quot;
Kapak picked his tooth. &quot;The Solaris had broken into a max security Anyocorp warehouse and had actually manage to steal the man&#39;s brain. They sacrificed 3 of their own just for a chance to save the man&#39;s life... I couldn&#39;t refuse to do the job for free... so I charged &#39;em only half I usually do.&quot;
He smirked for a moment. &quot;No, I won&#39;t charge you for this whole ordeal, I&#39;ve changed. But back then, I was different. I took the man&#39;s pretty much dead body and had to transfer his brain into a brand new skull- had to grow that whole sucker from scratch. Let me tell you, I did not get that man&#39;s face right the first three times.&quot;
He shrugged. &quot;In the end, the family went away happy. I wonder if they&#39;re still out there...&quot;

<u>Kapak:</u>
Kapak chuckled nervously and faced Kinsey. &quot;Oh, Helminth, you goofy,&quot; he scratched the back of his neck. Something seemed... off about Kapak. Was it his boils? They weren&#39;t glowing as brightly...?
&quot;What an overreactor, eh?&quot; He leaned over as close as possible to Kinsey without letting his fingers out of Adrova, giving the operator a playful nudge in the stomach with his elbow. Except, it was more like an elbow to the chest because Nidus was insufferably tall.

The operator listened quietly, finding hope in the minute rise and fall of Adrova&#39;s back. &quot;One of those Corpus cyborgs? Huh. Makes sense. I&#39;ve only worked with defectors before. They&#39;re pretty easy to patch up in comparison. One of em&#39; gets hurt and you can just grow some new bits and slap some metal on there. Little less creativity. Uh...&quot; they peered at Kapak, trying to figure out what was different. &quot;Hey, are you- oof!&quot;

The elbow caught them a bit off guard, interrupting their sentence. &quot;Hey! Both hands on the wheel, Doc!&quot; they snapped, &quot;And if it&#39;s any help, tell your creepy cephalon that I go marching around outside my &#39;mortal shell&#39; all the time and I&#39;m fine!&quot;

Sighing, Kinsey glanced over at Efahz, and saw him still staring blankly forward.

&quot;Aw, jeez...&quot; Kinsey muttered, walking over and sitting next to him again. They put an arm around his shoulder and gave him a little shake. &quot;Hey, buddy....&quot; they said quietly, &quot;You&#39;re really freaked out, I know, but you&#39;re gonna be okay...&quot;</span>

~There was a bit of a delay, but the crate shook and swayed a bit as it was lifted off of the ground, and began moving. The ride itself was dark, uneventful, and took quite a while. The vague whispers in his head, though, changed a bit. They became quiet, and almost... calming. Relaxing. Again, nothing was distinguishable, but it gave the impression that it was trying to soothe Chegar a bit. The tendrils and other bits of Infested on him had slowed down in their growth, and had almost settled a bit. The tendrils were wrapped around his limbs and torso by now, and the other bits weren&#39;t really doing much.~

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
~Efahz gave no indication that he had noticed the hug, just continuing to look rather blank. He did, however, mutter something rather quietly.
&quot;He&#39;s gonna die... All my fault...&quot; And with that, he fell silent again. He wasn&#39;t crying, or frowning, or anything. He was just sorta expressionless. No emotion in his voice or facial expressions. Just the lack thereof.~</span>

&quot;Umm... a blanket?&quot; Kapak stroked his chin. After a moment of pondering, he snapped his fingers and pointed to Helminth&#39;s still flicking holographic eye.
&quot;Helminth, can you get Mr. Ch- excuse me, Gethar to see if there are any blankets from Koya or Kuve&#39;s cots?&quot; The red eye blinked and then fizzled away- the room seemed to be bluer, colder without the hologram&#39;s red light.
&quot;And you!&quot; Kapak pointed at Efahz, while his fingers were still awkwardly stuck inside Adrova, &quot;that I would consider a great insult to my magnificent work! If anyone dies, it will be because I made a mistake. And I don&#39;t make mistakes.&quot;
The Nidus wagged a finger at Efahz and then turned back to Adrova, not paying any mind to whether or not Efahz would have acknowledged his liitle rant.
Kapak, now staring intently at Adrova&#39;s exposed back become silent, and still, almost like a statue. He seemed to be focusing extremely intently on something.
&quot;Face the wall,&quot; Kapak&#39;s voice resounded, although the Warframe&#39;s mouth didn&#39;t move. &quot;Both of you. And do not turn around until I say.&quot;</span>

Kinsey got up into a crouch and gently coaxed Efahz to turn around. &quot;There, see? It&#39;s not your fault. I promise.&quot; they said, again sitting next to him and wrapping an arm around his shoulders.

Once making sure their near-catatonic friend was turned away, Kinsey gave a thumbs-up with their free hand. &quot;Okay, we&#39;re set!&quot;</span>

~The room became silent, save for the soft squelching of the flesh within and on the walls of the room, Oluth’s low growl, and the scorpion-Stinger-machine’s soft humming.
There was a rustling behind Kinsey. It was sudden, and quite loud compared to the rest of the room’s silent ambience.</span>

It took a serious amount of impulse control to avoid just tuning around at the noise. They squeezed their eyes shut, focusing on hugging Efahz close and trying desperately to ignore the curious noises behind them.</span>

The little creature retracted its hand as soon as Kinsey landed a palm across it. It let out a hiss, but didn&#39;t retaliate. Instead, it sat back, wrapping its long arms around its knees and staring, unblinking into Kinsey&#39;s eyes.
The silence continued on now, or at least the quite droning of the combined ambient noise did.</span>

With the perceived threat gone, it started to sink in how Kinsey had overreacted. They took a deep breath, trying to get their emotions under control. &quot;Muck. I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re just trying to help, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

The tenno shook their head, ashamed. &quot;We&#39;re both kind of a mess right now, Efahz and I. Look at me, I don&#39;t even know if you can figure out what the muck I&#39;m saying.&quot;</span>

Still burning with curiosity about whatever was going on behind them, Kinsey glanced sideways, very nearly looking over their shoulder, but catching themself just in time. <em>Muck, that was close!</em>  &quot;Doc, how&#39;s it going over there? You&#39;re creeping me out, dammit!&quot;</span>

&quot;Well, guess that&#39;s a no. I hope Doc&#39;s doing something useful.&quot; Kinsey commented, shifting nervously in place. They had no idea whether it had been thirty seconds or an hour, and occupied themself with listening to Efahz breathe next to them while their own heart pounded in their ears.

The hiss of the airlock made Kinsey jump slightly, and they very nearly looked right at whoever it was. They likely caught a glimpse of the figure as it passed their peripheral vision, but the Tenno again barely managed to keep from turning around.

&quot;H...hello?&quot; they managed.</span>

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;Keep looking at the wall,&quot; Kapak&#39;s voice rang out, although different. It was less bass, and more laboured than usual, but also smoother at the same time. A touch of the mechanical reverb was there as well- perhaps caused by wearing a mask?
The room suddenly lit up, a vibrant, neon green. There was a crackling, like an electrical panel had broken and the circuit had begun to arc off of the surroundings. Kinsey could feel it- the Void. Pulsating, radiating, echoing from the center of the room behind him.
The roar of the Void energy steadily grew, until it was almost deafening. The entire room seemed to shake, vibrating with whatever power was being unleashed.
And then, all at once, the light faded to darkness. The sound halted. The room seemed even quieter, even more shadowy, now that whatever had just happened had passed. The laboured breathing remained for a moment, huffing and puffing even moreso than before.</span>

&quot;S-sorry. I didn&#39;t see anything, I swear,&quot; Kinsey replied, staring firmly at the wall. They were about to ask another question, but before any more words left their mouth, the room filled with green light. They hugged Efahz close again, whispering to him that it&#39;d be okay. Soon their whisper was drowned out, and they could only cling to their friend and wait for it to pass.

&quot;Are you alright? Is it done? Can I turn around?&quot; Kinsey asked, heart still pounding.</span>

&quot;It is... done.&quot; The voice wheezed for a moment before the familiar sound of a Tenno warping away sounded out. There was a clatter as what must have been Kapak tripped and smashed something onto the floor.
&quot;You can turn around now,&quot; he coughed. When Kinsey were to back, he would see Kapak leaning against the slab, next to Adrova, who was breathing in a much less shallow manner. Kapak&#39;s fingers were also no longer inside Adrova&#39;s exposed flesh.
&quot;He&#39;s breathing. I&#39;m... going to check his brain... for...&quot; Kapak stumbled as he tried to get up from leaning against the slab, but it only caused him to fall again. Now he was on the floor, gripping the edge of the slab. Was that... sweat on his Warframe?
&quot;...check his brain. Mephalus, do your voiddamn job, would you??&quot; Kapak slammed his fist against the ground, and Mephalus jumped up from his sitting place, chittered for a moment, and then hopped towards the Orokin electroencephalograph.</span>

Even before Kapak had finished his sentence, Kinsey leapt to their feet and tugged Efahz up as well. “Efahz, he’s breathing! He’s breathing again!!” They cried, tears forming in their eyes as they dragged Efahz over to the slab.

“Holy shit, you did it! Holy shit!” Kinsey repeated in disbelief. They paused in their (possibly premature) celebration to stare at Kapak. “Void, you look like shit! Are you alright?” They asked, crouching to offer the large Nidus a hand up, still glancing back and forth between him and the now-breathing (breathing!!!!) Adrova.</span>

&quot;I&#39;m... fine,&quot; Kapak spoke, extending his longer wingspan to push Kinsey away at the chest. He seemed to be angry at something, perhaps his current physical weakness?
Well, whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t stopping him from seeing through to the end of this operation.
&quot;He&#39;s not fully alive yet, but that breathing is a good sign. Mephalus, results?&quot;
Mephalus blabbered and burped, pointing with a laser pointing to the glass window-like screen on the electroencephalograph. Some Orokin letters flashed across it, as well as several geometric lines that ran up and down the screen like a jagged crest of mountains.
Kapak wiped the sweat from his frame&#39;s body. &quot;Thank goodness. Subconscious is active, autonomous brain functions seem to be working. If they weren&#39;t, that would mean he&#39;d have to go back under the knife. I would&#39;ve had to cut open his skull and install some new brain matter.&quot;
Kapak snapped his fingers with a flourish, although nothing happened. &quot;There. My Technocytes are no longer controlling his breathing at all, or any of his other functions. Let me double check his vitals though while I&#39;m still in him.&quot;
There was silence for a moment, then slowly, Kapak sounded off his findings.
&quot;Temperature; 34.8 degrees Celsius. Too low, but we&#39;ll warm him up.&quot;
&quot;Heart rate; 62 BPM. Spot on.&quot;
&quot;Breath rate; 13 per minute. Acceptable, especially considering he&#39;s unconscious.&quot;
&quot;Blood pressure; 90 over 65. On the low side, but makes sense considering he basically had lost all of his blood- also I have to finish cleaning up this back here.&quot;
Kapak clapped his hands together, as if dusting them off.

Could range from minor behavioural changes to loss of motor control to even complete memory loss. That&#39;s something I really can&#39;t fix though.&quot;
Kapak cracked his back and waved his hand, and the scorpion tail machine hybrid reinserted itself into Kapak&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s give this man some morphine in case he wakes up in the middle of me cleaning up his back.

Kapak moved back into working position, and the room filled with noise again as Oluth gurgled, the claw machine whirred, and Kapak muttered to himself. The airlock opened, and Petrisis re-entered the room with a white blanket with red stitching all over it... huh, it appeared to be embraided with &quot;Vay Hek is Sexy&quot; and &quot;I love you John&quot;. The Infested creature dumped the blanket before Efahz and Kinsey, bowed rigidly, and then moved over to help Mephalus cuff Adrova&#39;s limbs.

~The crate slowed, and eventually stopped completely. The whispering disappeared for a moment, and everything seemed impossibly quiet. No noise anywhere, whatsoever. And then, the voice came back.

&quot;<em><strong>Prepare yourself, as there is going to be a bit of a... drop. Apologies.</strong></em>&quot; The voice warned... right as the &#39;floor&#39; below Chegar split down the middle, causing him to fall several meters into more darkness. The floor was also clearly made of metal, but something was... off. If he tried using any of his powers, none of them would function. At all. There was a Nullifier generator here somewhere. Unfortunately, though, there was no light source here. No visibility.~

<strong>LEVERET/KAPAK</strong>
~Luckily for Kapak, Adrova hadn&#39;t woken up yet. He&#39;d be able to complete the rest of the procedure with him still unconcious. At least he was stable now, right? His condition wasn&#39;t worsening, and everything seemed to be going well.
Meanwhile, Efahz was just sorta maintaining his stare throughout all of this. Sure, Adrova was healed, but... now his brain would be damaged. Honestly, he wasn&#39;t sure whether or not Adrova was better off dead.</span>

Quickly getting the message, Kinsey backed away from Kapak to let him regain some of his dignity. Tears continued to well up in their eyes - well, at least the one that wasn&#39;t covered with an ocular guard - as they listened to Kapak read out Adrova&#39;s vitals. &quot;Yeah, Doc, whatever you need to do. You&#39;ve already gone above and beyond what I thought we could do for him. I trust you.&quot;

Their heart sank as they considered the issue of brain damage. One hand found Efahz&#39;s and squeezed it encouragingly, the other being used to wipe their eye.

As soon as the blanket was delivered, Kinsey briefly released Efahz for just long enough to make a thankful gesture towards Petrisis and scoop up the blanket, wrapping it around Efahz&#39;s shoulders tightly - clearly something they&#39;d done for others many times before.  &quot;It&#39;s okay, Efahz, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll figure it out. He might not be exactly the same but he&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;

&quot;There, his body is finished,&quot; Kapak announced. His arm twisted back into normal form, and the scorpion stinger of a machine whirred &amp; clicked as it detached from Kapak&#39;s shoulder, withdrawing back up the the ceiling. Oluth&#39;s intestinal tube thing also disconnected from the machine, and the blobby spider Infested began to wander blindly back into the corner of the room, gently bumping into walls and other objects along the way.
Adrova&#39;s back looked- well, perfect. There wasn&#39;t any blemishes on his skin, no birthmarks, no pimples, not a single imperfection. There were no surgical scars at all, but the difference between the rest of Adrova&#39;s skin and the new, baby-like flesh was enough to create a false one.
&quot;Some of my finest work, probably. He might be a bit stiff in the back, but getting some exercise will sort that out.&quot; Kapak smiled proudly for a moment before his happiness faltered.
&quot;Cough, I mean, ahem, that is, if, er, when he, uhh, wakes up.&quot; Kapak scratched his chin. &quot;Should be try smelling salts or something, maybe?&quot;
Mephalus squawked and covered its eyes with its hands.
&quot;Oh, right.&quot; Kapak gnawed on his finger in thought. &quot;Nevermind then. Uh, well!&quot; he clapped his hands together loudly as he turned to face his two guests. &quot;All we can do is wait now. Would you like some food, or anything? We might as well plan out our next step against Chlorineman while we&#39;re here. My Orbiter will be your base of operations for the time being.&quot;
Kapak leaned on the edge of the slab, moving only to let the Infested Engineers unshackle Adrova&#39;s limbs.
&quot;This target of yours is dangerous. Tell me, those Infested Warframes- you may have explained this already, but how do they work? Is there some Tenno behind them? Or have they been granted an autonomic hivemind vomeronasal nervous system?&quot;
Kapak stopped himself and smiled awkwardly. &quot;Sorry. In simpler terms, do they act without an Operator?&quot;</span>

You went above and beyond what I expected. I....I didn&#39;t expect him to make it this far.&quot; They smiled tearfully as they pulled away from what was, most likely, among one of the more sticky hugs they&#39;d experienced.

Kinsey sniffed and patted Efahz on the back reassuringly. &quot;Maybe not food, but a hot drink would be a good idea. Maybe something with a little alcohol in it too, for Efahz here. Is there somewhere a little less...creepy, we can move to? I think we both need a change of scenery, and Adrova could probably use a bed.&quot;</span>

~&quot;I... believe that Clogori&#39;s... <em>things</em>... have Operators. We saw Tarnas&#39; back on Europa.&quot; Efahz snapped out of his blank stare long enough to explain this to Kapak, before looking at the now-breathing Adrova. He didn&#39;t even acknowledge Kinsey.
Speaking of Adrova, the revived Crewman moved slightly, a few fingers twitching. Then, his left arm moved slightly. He was finally regaining conciousness, after being dead for quite a while. There were a couple of confused grunts, as he was still face-down on the operating table.~</span>

Kapak snapped his fingers at Mephalus and made some kind of gesture that resembled chugging a soda can. The little creature obeyed the signal, running out of the room and into the airlock, presumably to get things.
&quot;Absolutely. I&#39;ll move you gu-&quot; Kapak stopped as he received Kinsey’s tiny hug. It wasn’t often that such a monstrous being such as himself received affection like this, so he turned in kind with a very awkward pat on Kinsey’s back.
&quot;Hmmm? Did he just move?&quot; Kapak turned his attention away to look at his patient and slapped his forehead.
&quot;OI, YOU WALKING CERVIX, NEXT TIME WE&#39;RE DONE WITH A PATIENT, MAYBE WE CAN SET THEM RIGHT SIDE UP?!&quot; he yelled towards the airlock, even though Mephalus was long gone. The Nidus sighed, and signalled to Petrisis. &quot;Let&#39;s go bud, stabilize his head. We&#39;re gonna flip him over nice and easy.&quot;
Slowly and carefully, Kapak turned Adrova right side up while Petrisis stood over Adrova&#39;s head, steading him using his long fingers and arms. Petrisis leaned in over Adrova and sniffed the Corpus&#39; face with what holes he had for nostrils.
&quot;Leveret- or Kinsey- or whatever the muck you are- why don&#39;t you come over here? It would be best for him to see a familiar face upon waking up, as opposed to well...&quot; He coughed and ran a finger along his boney jawline.</span>

Kinsey found themself at a loss for words. They&#39;d never had to talk to someone who&#39;d just been brought back from the dead. They didn&#39;t want to overwhelm him, yet so many urgent questions spiraled in their mind. <em>Does he remember us? Does he remember anything?</em></span>

~Efahz walked a bit closer to the now-alive Adrova, almost looking vaguely hopeful. He didn&#39;t say anything yet, though. Adrova did seem to be waking up, though, as he took a rather sudden breath in, and his arms and legs stretched out a bit. Nothing concerning, just stretching a bit as he woke up. This might just have been a really weird nap for him.
He woke up fully a moment later, eyes opening to look around. He was immediately met with Kinsey and Efahz looking down at him. He looked confused for a moment, luckily not noticing Kapak. He sat up slightly, trying to prop himself up on his elbows. Then, finally, he asked something, sounding rather confused.
&quot;Where... where am I? Who are you?&quot;</span>

&quot;Settle down,&quot; Kapak said as he laid a claw on Kinsey&#39;s shoulder, &quot;he might need a bit of a memory jogging- if so, I might have just the thing he needs.&quot;
Kapak let Kinsey go and approached Adrova. He gently placed a hand on his back to help support him.
&quot;My name is, ah, Doctor. Not 10 minutes ago, you were dead. Now, listen here, we&#39;re here to help you. I know you may have a lot of questions, but I have a little test that I need you to do.&quot;
Kapak sounded off several questions, waiting for Adrova&#39;s response each time before continuing on to the next. Petrisis had by now hopped off the operating slab and had picked up some old Corpus datapad and handed it to Kapak.
While the Nidus turned it on and began to press some buttons on the screen, he asked Adrova:
&quot;What is your full name? And repeat after me; maprico, vitruvian, ducat.&quot;</span>

No idea who any of you are. Is this... some sort of weird dream or something?&quot; He asked, looking around the room a bit as he tried to sit up a bit more.
&quot;Adrova, it&#39;s me. Efahz. We&#39;re in a Tenno ship. One of Clogori&#39;s things got you, and the Doctor fixed you up.&quot; Efahz explained, pointing at Kapak. &quot;Lev caught up with us. And I think Chegar&#39;s here  somewhere.&quot; Maybe Adrova remembered something. Anything.
&quot;What&#39;s a Clogori? Who... who&#39;s Chegar? Who are <em>you</em>?&quot; He asked Efahz, who looked completely broken by this question alone. &quot;Why are we in a Tenno ship? What&#39;s going on here?&quot; He reached for a sidearm of some sort, but found he was unarmed. &quot;Is this some sort of kidnapping or something?&quot;~</span>

“No, no this...I rescued you from uh. An infested Valkyr. She mucked you up <em>really</em> bad. You...stopped breathing in my arms. If it weren’t for Doc here, you’d still be dead. If you need proof that we’re allies, I’m sure I can come up with something. I can prove the wound, how you helped us get here, the whole thing. Efahz- he’s Perrin too, you can trust him, even if you don’t trust us Tenno.”

Kinsey sniffled again and took another deep breath, turning to the Nidus, “Doc, you said something about a spot that’s a little less creepy? Can we move there and settle in, maybe?”</span>

&quot;Just a second, Kimbo, I want to do some last few checks here to make sure he&#39;s alright, health wise.&quot;
Petrisis, without having to be asked to, handed Kapak a tiny flashlight.
&quot;Look here please, and hold your eye open.&quot; Kapak said, shining the light around the corners of Adrova&#39;s eyes. He was checking to see how his eyes behaved when exposed to a strong light source.
&quot;Also...&quot; Kapak said as he observed Adrova&#39;s eyes, &quot;why don&#39;t you give Adrova here a blanket? His core temperature is quite low. I don&#39;t have any Thermal Blankets, so we&#39;re just gonna have to put on some layers.&quot;</span>

~Adrova&#39;s pupils seemed to be adjusting, so there was that, at least. He was still glancing around the room occasionally, trying to get his bearings. He reached to touch the wound on his back, feeling the extremely smooth new skin there. Compared to the skin around the wound, there was definitely a difference.
&quot;But... if this is true, why do I have no idea who any of you are, then? None of you look familiar in the slightest.&quot; Adrova shrugged, touching his forehead. &quot;Last thing I remember... I dunno. I don&#39;t know when any of this stuff happened. There are events, I know they happened, but... there isn&#39;t an order to them.&quot;
 Efahz took the blanket on his shoulders, tossing it to Adrova. Adrova was caught off-guard by the blanket, and didn&#39;t have a chance to catch it before it draped over his head, probably interrupting Kapak.

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~For the Warframe, it was unclear how much time had passed. Maybe a few minutes, or hours, or days... the whispering in his head was back. The singular voice had disappeared again, the many whispering, indistinguishable voices returning. There was no other motion, or sound, or anything in this room. Not even the whirring of the ship. Nothing.
Eventually, after the unknown amount of time, something happened. The voices were gone again. There was an absolute silence for mere moments. And then, there was noise. A familiar voice. A <em>very</em> familiar voice, likely coming from some sort of speaker in the room.
&quot;Welcome, Chegar. I&#39;ve been expecting you.&quot; Clogori said.~</span>

&quot;You were, uh...dead. For a little while. Doc said you might have some brain damage. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s what happened?&quot; They sniffled again, wiping their nose on their sleeve. &quot;Ugh, sorry. I swear I don&#39;t usually get all sobby like this.&quot;

Kinsey reflexively leaned back to avoid the blanket as it flew past, then quickly moved to help Adrova wrap it around himself instead.  &quot;Void, you must be <em>freezing,&quot;</em> they muttered, making sure he was tightly bundled, whether or not Adrova protested. &quot;Doc, how&#39;s he looking?

&quot;Alright bud, just do this one last test for me, and we&#39;ll get you to a much nicer place with a hot drink. Also we&#39;ll answer as many questions that you have as we can.&quot; Kapak tapped the side of the tablet.

~Adrova managed to get wrapped up in the blanket. He wasn&#39;t shivering or anything, but he would probably be a bit more comfortable now. The now blanket-less Efahz had slowly moved to a corner, staying out of the way as all of this stuff happened. He didn&#39;t really have much to add right now, after all.
Adrova gave a quick thumbs up to Kapak, and tried drawing the clock. Well, &#39;trying&#39; was probably the right word, as he ended up drawing something closer to 2:15. Not only that, but his hand was a bit shaky. It didn&#39;t look like Adrova knew he had done anything wrong, though.~</span>

The Tenno watched in anticipation as Adrova drew the clock, quizzing themself by figuring out what the clock should look like. They then observed with growing anxiety as Adrova drew a clock that was decidedly <em>not</em> 6:30. <em>His hand looks shaky...maybe he’s just cold?</em>

Kinsey looked back and forth between the tablet and Kapak, not wanting to say anything. They’d managed to stop sniffling, but  that nagging anxiety stuck around.

Although they’d noticed Efahz moving back from their peripheral vision, they were too focused on Adrova to process it at all.</span>

&quot;Uh, alright then! Let&#39;s get a move on, then. Slowly, Slowly!&quot; Kapak helped Adrova step down onto the floor. The metal floor next to the operating slab would have greeted Adrova&#39;s bare feet with a pleasantly warm feel. He definitely needed to bathe though- the Corpus&#39; feet were stained dark brown with dried blood.
&quot;Let&#39;s see how well he can walk... he might get a bit dizzy at first, but we&#39;ll see!&quot;</span>

~Adrova looked down at his feet for the first time since waking up. He hadn&#39;t forgotten what he looked like, of course, but he was also standing up. Just wanted to be sure that everything was attatched. You can imagine his surprise when he saw they were covered in... blood? Was that blood? Dried blood? Why? How? Honestly, though, at this point, he was in no mood to question any of this.
His attempt at standing up had mixed success. He stumbled a bit, almost falling flat on his face. With a bit of assistance, though, he was able to keep his balance. Throughout all of this, Efahz was still watching from the corner, not saying anything. It was... more depressing than anything to watch this. So, he just stayed in the corner, watching Adrova try to stand up.
&quot;Whoa, uh... okay, I&#39;ve got this.&quot; Adrova wobbled a little bit, but managed to stay upright in the end. Well, he could stand at least, right? That&#39;s always good news.~</span>

Hiding their shock at the fact that Kapak hardly acknowledged the messed up clock, Kinsey swallowed hard and took a deep breath, helping Adrova onto the floor. &quot;Easy now...&quot; they said in a low voice, offering their arm for him to grip for balance if need be.

&quot;Adrova Haffon, back from the dead!&quot; they said with a (slightly forced) smile, giving his shoulder a gentle pat. &quot;Hey uh, Doc? We gonna need masks to get to the other room? I could probably zip up my hood and give the mask to Adrova.&quot;</span>

&quot;Hey, look at that! You&#39;ve got it!&quot; Kapak grinned and did a little jazz hands maneuver at Adrova.
&quot;Okay. Now, let&#39;s go over to the comfy zone...&quot; Kapak hesitated, as if becoming lost in thought for a moment before snapping back into focus.
&quot;Right. Uh, masks! No need, I&#39;ve got another in here...&quot; Kapak quickly jogged to the back of the room and back, grabbing another filter-mask-apparatus as his heels clunked over the glass of the fishtank.
&quot;Help him put it on, you muckin&#39; Corpus,&quot; he instructed to Efahz, while picking up the other two masks and extending them outwards for Kinsey and Efahz to take for themselves when they were ready.
When Kinsey would&#39;ve reached for his mask, Kapak firmly locked his fingers over his shoulder and pulled the Tenno&#39;s ear next to his mouth.
&quot;Listen, pal, I can smell your worry. And it&#39;s rightfully placed,&quot; the Nidus growled softly in a whisper, &quot;considering everything I&#39;ve seen, Androovoh has a good chance of having, or developing short term memory loss.&quot;
Kapak glanced over Kinsey&#39;s shoulder to the others before whispering again,
&quot;Now, here, he has amnesia right now, that&#39;s obvious. But I may have something that will help with both his memory loss as well as amnesia. Let&#39;s just make sure that he&#39;s comfortable and healthy before we start dealing with his mind.&quot;
Kapak released his grip, his fingers crackling like popcorn as he let go for some bizarre reason.</span>

~Adrova took the mask himself, managing to put it on without Efahz&#39;s help. It was a bit of a struggle, but he was eventually successful. Honestly, he was still a bit <em>too</em> disoriented and confused to really ask any questions about anything that was going on, content with not dying right now. Well, not dying again. Meanwhile, Efahz was having no issues with putting the mask on, probably because he wasn&#39;t literally brought back from the dead a few minutes ago.

&quot;What-&quot; Adrova tried to duck out of the way of the pat, only succeeding in stumbling forward a bit. Seeing as he has no idea who Kinsey even is anymore, that was probably an attempt at self-defense.

&quot;Oh! Rahm, sorry...&quot; Kinsey said, quickly pulling back from the pat. &quot;It won&#39;t happen again, I promise.&quot;

The tenno froze and listened closely as Kapak whispered into their ear. They could see the glowing fluid pulsating through the translucent areas of his frame, moving much slower than their current heart rate. This close, Kapak would also smell hints of fear and anger as well. Once he was done speaking, Kinsey nodded rapidly and emphatically. &quot;Gotcha. Thank you again. Really.&quot;

Once they got their mask on, they turned to make sure their crewman friends were also set to move through the rest of Kapak&#39;s ship. If Efahz hadn&#39;t grabbed his helmet yet, they&#39;d make sure he had before they left the infirmary.</span>

Once everyone had their masks on, Kapak smiled and ushered everyone into the airlock.
&quot;Please keep your masks on at all times, and don&#39;t touch anything weird.&quot; Kapak warned as the airlock closed. The familiar spray of blue gas washed over them before the chamber opened on the reverse side, allowing them back into the bottom hallway of the Infested Orbiter.
&quot;Right through here gentlemen,&quot; Kapak waved to them as he stopped next to a similar airlock installed into the doorway to the Tenno Somatic chamber.

~The air was warm, humid. Likely a spectacular sight to Adrova, and also to Kinsey who would probably be able to take notice of things better now that the urgency of saving Adrova&#39;s life had passed; the golden spores swung about the Tenno in wake of his movement, almost as if they danced and played alongside his movements. The walls pulsated and moved, shifting to an unheard heartbeat. Hopefully whatever was on the other side of that airlock would be more... normal?~</span>

~Adrova looked around, clearly a bit surprised by all of this, and possibly even fascinated. Sure, he was also very much on-edge, but still. It was a bit odd to see Adrova of all people do this, though, especially after how serious he was just moments ago. Efahz, on the other hand, kept facing ahead. He didn&#39;t seem particularly interested in looking around, or just sorta disinterested in everything right now. It wasn&#39;t easy to tell. Efahz was certainly silent, but Adrova was muttering quietly, mostly about how cool this all was.
&quot;I had no idea Infested could even form like this... I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have much of an idea about anything, but...&quot; Adrova seemed to trail off, looking as if he had lost his train of thought and had just sorta given up on finishing what he had said. Prooooobably another concerning symptom.~</span>

Most unnerving of all was the fleshy, glowing, beating heart within the center of the wood-like cocoon.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;Alright! As you can see,&quot; Kapak waved, pointing to his left, revealing a row of three cots, &quot;I have these old cots from... previous adventures of mine. You&#39;re all welcome to nap on them. Andewya, you feeling all good? Queasy at all?&quot;

~Another one of the Engineers, this one very, very fat for its size, made its way over to the group. It burbled and patted its face before pointing towards Kinsey&#39;s. One of the other Engineers of normal proportions way off to the right side of the room... seemingly doing something in a kitchenette made of clearly scavenged Grineer technology. At least all of it had been polished and painted, matching the clean feeling of (most) of the rest of the room.~</span>

Having been expecting Adrova to freak out at the trip through Kapak&#39;s ship, Kinsey was relieved to see he was at least pretty calm. Still, they kept a close eye on him, in case he suddenly looked unsteady or anything. Efahz, on the other hand, still seemed like he was barely holding it together. With the comfort of the blanket currently applied to Adrova, Kinsey could only find Efahz&#39;s hand and give it a gentle, reassuring squeeze.

As soon as they made it to the near-pristine room, Kinsey slipped off their mask and moved to help the crewmen with theirs. &quot;Doc, it&#39;s Adrova, not....whatever the muck you just said. Get it right, will ya? No need to confuse him any more than he already is.&quot; they grumbled, leading both Efahz and Adrova over to the cots and plopping down on one of them as well.

&quot;Jeez, this place is clean. What&#39;s up with your somatic link, though? How are you not trapped in there?&quot;</span>

~Efahz finally almost seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, now that he was no longer stuck in the hellscape that was the rest of the ships. Adrova, on the other hand, had been very tense right up until now, and seemed to relax almost immediately upon seeing this far less twisted and horrifying room. It was most certainly an improvement.
&quot;What&#39;s a Somatic- ah, nevermind.&quot; Adrova shrugged, remembering the whole memory loss thing. &quot;Not really feeling queasy... a bit lightheaded, though.&quot; Well, it was an improvement over being dead.
&quot;Look, I don&#39;t know what all of you are doing now, but didn&#39;t we have a <em>job</em> to do? As in hunting Clogori? Why we came all of the way here?&quot; Efahz finally broke his silence to go on a mini-rant, mostly focused on Adrova and Leveret. Adrova seemed sort of surprised at the sudden outburt, because as far as he remembers, this is the first time he&#39;s seen Efahz talk.~</span>

Seeing Efahz and Adrova finally relax a bit, Kinsey let out a breath they didn&#39;t know they&#39;d been holding.
&quot;Hey, Adrova, come have a seat over here. You&#39;re probably not feeling great because you lost, like, <em>all</em> of your blood. He patched you up pretty good but I think Doc said your blood pressure was still a bit low.&quot; Kinsey said, patting the cot next to the one they&#39;d plopped down on.&quot;

As soon as Efahz spoke up, however, the stress ramped up again. &quot;Hhhh. Yeah. We do. We also need to get Chegar out of there before it&#39;s too late. <em>But,</em> Adrova <em>died.</em> He doesn&#39;t remember any of that. You really think it&#39;s a good idea to just wake him up, dump him in a bed, and say &#39;Seeya later!&#39; and hope we come back? We at least owe him a short summary!&quot;</span>

~Efahz was silent for a moment, obviously pondering something. Adrova, on the other hand, had crouched down to observe one of the cots, curious about what exactly they were made of. After all of this Infested, he was understandably a little bit suspicious. Finally, Efahz spoke up.
&quot;Could I talk to you about something, quickly?&quot; Efahz asked, sounding a bit calmer all of a sudden. Almost too calm. He gestured for a corner a bit further away from Adrova, clearly wanting a bit of privacy.~</span>

&quot;Wha- Yeah, sure.&quot; Kinsey said, following Efahz to the corner. Their mind raced as they tried to figure out what he could be asking about. <em>Probably something that might freak out Adrova,</em> they concluded.

As soon as they reached the spot Efahz had picked for their private discussion, they leaned in to listen. &quot;Ok, I&#39;m here. What&#39;s up?&quot; they asked in a low voice, sounding concerned.</span>

~Once they were clear of Adrova, Efahz was silent for a moment as he seemed to collect his thoughts. He had a lot of stufd on his mind right now, only a portion of which was actually mentioned. Finally, though, he spoke in a hushed voice, barely a whisper.
&quot;Look, that isn&#39;t Adrova, okay? That isn&#39;t him. His body is there, but his mind isn&#39;t. He has some of his memories, but he&#39;s acting completely different. Look at him! Have you <em>ever</em> seen him behave like this?&quot; He gestured to Adrova, who was currently inspecting the cot. &quot;He would be ready for something to go wrong, not walking around unarmed in a ship full of Infested <em>inside</em> another ship full of Infested, acting like everything is okay. That&#39;s. Not. Adrova.&quot;~</span>

Either way, he&#39;s still <em>someone,</em> and we still owe it to him - Adrova or otherwise - to make this less of a kidnapping than it is right now!

They sighed. &quot;One step at a time, right? At least come sit down for a bit, maybe rest your leg and get something to drink?&quot; Kinsey offered, fully expecting Efahz to slip back into his earlier unresponsive state at any moment.</span>

It didn’t take long for it to reach its’ destination; a Tenno orbiter no different from the standard. The docking sequence was quick, latching onto the larger structure with a dull thud.~</div>

<strong>???</strong>
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">~A White, green trimmed Frost lumbered toward the docking bay.
{“Good to see you’re back, Chegar. Take it things weren’t too easy on yah?”} The Frost jested.
No reply.
{“Ah, c’mon, Kiddo. You know I’m ribbing ya.”} The Frost continued, opening the rotory door of the scimitar. He was greeted with an empty cabin; No Warframe, no Tenno, no one.
The Frost dashed towards the transference chamber, finding Chegar laying in the chair with his eyes closed.
”Chegar?” The Frost said, Snapping and clapping next to the Tenno’s head. No response. The Frost checked the Tenno’s pulse; It was strong and at a good resting pace. He pressed his fist in the center of the Tenno’s chest, moving his knuckles briskly across Chegar’s breastbone; still no response.
Something was very wrong. 
The Frost ran back to the docked ship, and began pulling files from it’s black box, hoping Chegar’s warframe had sent something back to it.
The Frost was in luck; and FFID tag for someone named ‘Leveret’ was still in the system, along with the tag’s last known location. It was a quick jog up to the nav-console; the Frost wasted no time entering in the coordinates, and even less time directing the orbiter there.

{“This is CEPHALON SVYTOJ of Tenno transport Vigil Major. Does anyone read me?”} The Frost radioed. With any luck, this Leveret would still be within range of the broadcast.~</div></span>

The other Engineer, the fat one, followed Kinsey, eagerly awaiting something. It even eavesdropped through their private conversation- although whether or not it even understood anything was unknown.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
“Oh, ha ha!” Kapak giggled as Kinsey questioned the rooty mass in the back center of the chamber. The fleshy innard of the treelike Technocytic formation jiggled and pulsed, glowing with the syllables of the words. “No, I’m not stuck in here.”
The Nidus said nothing more, but instead left the others and moved towards the Infested Somatic Link.

~&quot;It&#39;s pretty clear that the Doc has <em>something</em> guarding the ship. Look, Adrova is stable now, right? He isn&#39;t gonna start bleeding out or something. We should let him stay here, and go find Clogori.&quot; Efahz suggested. At the mention of resting his leg, he noticably shifted his weight a little bit. &quot;I&#39;m not gonna stay here while he&#39;s doing... whatever he&#39;s doing here. This isn&#39;t really time for a break, <em>especially considering that we have no idea where Chegar is.&quot;
Efahz glanced over at Adrova again, who still wasn&#39;t acting very Adrova-ish. Efahz seemed to be getting a bit restless, very clearly intending on going with the Tenno again to find Clogori.
&quot;Besides, I don&#39;t like the Doc&#39;s ship. It just seems... off.&quot; He added after a moment.~

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
~Unfortunately for Svytoj, Leveret wasn&#39;t the only one in range of the communication. There was a pause, as a completely different communication came from some unknown source.
&quot;So, *Vigil Major</em>. Funny, that sounds just like another Tenno&#39;s ship. A Tenno that just so <em>happens</em> to be here. Today is just <em>full</em> of coincidences, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Said a mildly static-y voice very clearly belonging to Clogori. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re here for Chegar. If so, good news. We have him right here, safe and sound.&quot;
The communication changed to a security camera feed. It showed a dark room, looking almost completely empty. Almost. If he looked close enough, he could see Chegar&#39;s Nekros, covered head to toe in Infested growths and tendrils, dragged into a corner. It looked sorta like it was... twitching occasionally. It wasn&#39;t clear from the low-resolution feed if the twitching was from Chegar himself, or the Infested tendrils.~

~Adrova accepted the food, sort of suspiciously prodding at it for a moment before concluding that it was probably safe. In a ship this absolutely full of Infested, he was understandably a bit concerned about hygeine. He sipped the water, occasionally having little bits of the food. When everything became red and scary all of a sudden, he didn&#39;t even seem to notice. Like, at all. Again, that may be mildly concerning. He only looked up and around upon the mention of Svytoj&#39;s name.~

CLOGORI: TENNO/ROGUE SCIENTIST.
M.O.: Experimentation and implimentation of infested biomass/aumentation of Tenno and Warframe test subjects.

KNOWN ITEMS OF INQUIERY: 
The subjugation of Tenno Tarnas, and augmentation of said Tenno&#39;s Warframe.
The Augmentation of Tenno Tavus and his warframe.
The Execution of Tavus.
The previously unreported infested outbreak on Europa.

Clogori&#39;s lack of restrain, blatant disregard for basic security protocol, and failure to provide any documentation to any governing body is of greatest concern. It is in my opinion that if Clogori is not reigned in, we could experience an outbreak equivalent to that of the Jordas Golem event.

I have scheduled for an expedition to Europa to retrieved a sample of this infested strain. I do not know what information might be gleaned from it, but with any luck, some resistances may be developed to this strain.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">~Svytoj looked over the documentation closely.

It might ring a few bells, I don&#39;t know. Anyway, you should probably know that I have Chegar here.&quot; Everything about Clogori seemed to change all of a sudden.

&quot;Yes, we were all there. Clogori was transporting one of his experiments. I don&#39;t know if you also happen to know who this is, but he was transporting a Tenno by the name of Tarnas.&quot; Efahz explained, calming down a bit to talk to Svytoj. &quot;We got ambushed by Grineer during a Europa flyby, and crashed there. And then a <em>lot</em> of stuff happened.&quot;~</span>

The Nidus sat upright and turned around to face Kinsey with an annoyed grimace before yelling, his voice echoing through the room.
&quot;I CAN FIX A LOT OF STUFF OKAY?!? JUST LET ME HELP YOUR CORPUS FRIEND FIRST AND THEN I&#39;LL-&quot;
Kapak&#39;s sudden snapping came to a halt as he observed the Infested Warframe. &quot;Oh Void... uh, well, I tell you what. That Warframe is probably going to be a goner- it&#39;s already got a lot of visible mutations on the exterior, which means its skin is already contaminated. That&#39;s the hardest part to get past- but once you do, well.&quot;
He pointed a thumb at the projected image.
&quot;We can&#39;t save that Warframe. We don&#39;t have enough time to get to it before Chloroplastglory&#39;s Infestation overwrites its Genome and renders it incompatible with its native transference bolt.&quot; Kapak retracted the thumb and stuck it between his grey teeth.
&quot;Unless... this Chegar fellow- the Operator of the Warframe, I assume- he&#39;s still connected to it to some extent? Which means that Clovealgae probably isn&#39;t trying to steal the Warframe- he&#39;s probably trying to mindjack the Tenno. I&#39;ve seen this happen on a few weird instances- a Tenno trying to disconnect from their Warframe and something goes awry. Ends up with them stuck in a Transference Loop. Essentially trapped inside the Warframe&#39;s body. That also means that if Glowgori&#39;s Infestation provides neural stimulant via hormone secretions to the Warframe, combined with some oral coaxing, he could essentially manipulate the Tenno into doing what he wants.&quot;
Kapak paused for a moment and smiled apologetically.
&quot;Ah, pardon me- Infested Bad Man can mind control Chegar using the Warframe he is stuck in.&quot;
Kapak spat a gob of goo over the edge of the room, the droplet careening out of sight into the back of the Chamber. He turned and leaned back down, reaching his arm into the side of the mass of woody roots as he began to hum to himself, ignoring the further discussions.</span>

They were running out of responses to Efahz&#39;s stubbornness.

Kinsey winced as Kapak yelled, looking ever more stressed and grumpy. But as he spoke, they seemed to understand a bit more what he was saying. &quot;Yeah, actually, I told him to cut the link but he couldn&#39;t! That must be what this is, then. So.....if we can get Chegar out of the loop, we can save him? How are we going to get him out, thou -- oh voiddammit he&#39;s not listening. Great.&quot;

They sighed and turned their attention back to Svy. &quot;Well, you heard the guy. There might still be a way to save him. I mean, he <em>did</em> just literally bring my friend back to life, so I trust him at this point.&quot;</span>

Between Clogori, Efahz, Kinsey, and the Doc talking, it took a bit for the Frost to get a hold of everything said.
That, aside from the fact that Chegar was now hijacked and tethered to an infestation riddled warframe: Not good.
&quot;Uh... Okay...&quot; Svytoj steadied himself, and separated out the lines for Leveret and Clogori.
~<em>TO CLOGORI</em>~
&quot;{Alright, alright, Cool the mad-scientist egomania... Looks like you&#39;ve been busy; Between toying with the infested&#39;s genetics, capturing and experimenting on Tenno, seems you&#39;ve got your fingers in a few too many biohazardous pies.}&quot; Svytoj said, looking over Chegar&#39;s report. &quot;{Oh, and Killing Tavus; Low... Just F###ing Low. I get business is business, but...}&quot; Svytoj Paused.
&quot;{I&#39;m off topic. How the hell did you manage all this? How&#39;d you even get clearance for all this?}&quot;
~<em>TO LEVERET/KINSEY</em>~
On the other line, Svytoj&#39;s voice came through.
&quot;{So... I&#39;m talking to this Clogori guy; I&#39;m tryin&#39;a get a read on him. What sort of BS am I in for with negotiations?}&quot;</span>

~&quot;I suppose I gave myself clearance. To be honest, it&#39;s a bit of an odd situation. Regardless, though. As for how I managed all of this... Well, a few well-placed donations to the Perrin Sequence can go quite a long way. You&#39;d be surprised, actually.&quot; Again, Clogori seems to have gone back to his earlier, more calm and collected behavior. Something seemed off here. &quot;And Tavus... TA-01... He was a neccessary sacrifice.  He may have been a failure, but he advanced my research <em>significantly</em>. His mental responses to the presence of Infested was absolutely fascinating. Besides, he was glad to be put out of his misery.&quot;~

<strong>LEVERET AND KAPAK</strong>
~&quot;What am I supposed to do? Offer moral support every once in a while? Babysit Adrova? You <em>need</em> another gun out there, okay? Someone else to watch all of your backs. You&#39;re outnumbered 10,000 to one!&quot; Efahz whispered back at Kinsey, clearly gritting his teeth. &quot;Why are you so intent on this? This is what I&#39;m trained for. I&#39;m capable. Stop acting like I&#39;ve been crippled!&quot;
Efahz wasn&#39;t adding anything to the conversation with Svytoj at this point, figuring that Kapak had it handled. The Doctor certainly understood the subject of the Infested far more than the corpus, anyway.~</span>

You have to admit, it&#39;s pretty mucking hard for you to provide extra firepower when the walls and floor are ready to eat you! If you&#39;re that convinced that this is your time to die, mucking go for it, I guess, but if I lose you too, I might just shoot myself!&quot;

Still fuming, but with most of their viable retorts spent, Kinsey&#39;s mouth snapped shut. They clenched and unclenched their fists a few times, looking up just in time to catch the tail end of Svytoj&#39;s question. &quot;Oh, rahm, no way. You can&#39;t negotiate with this guy unless you want to swear away your firstborn or something. He tried to get me to bring Adrova to him instead of Doc here. &#39;We&#39;re masters of biology&#39;, he says. Well tell him he can SUCK MY ASS!&quot;</span>

Somehow, during the conversations, Kapak had materialized right behind Kinsey&#39;s back, having returned from the far side of the room. In his hands was a golden Urn, with obvious Orokin craftmanship decorating its sides. It was old, judging by the blemishes on the not-so-gleaming metal.
&quot;What&#39;s this I heard? Someone said something about sucking asses and now I am most intrigued!&quot; Kapak grinned and raised his arms outwards, waiting to get a laugh out of someone.</span>

~&quot;And why would I do that? To be told that my work was &#39;morally dubious&#39;? I need results, something I won&#39;t get if I waste my time with them. Science comes first. Look at all of the progress I&#39;ve made so far. Everything I&#39;ve done has been with who and what I could find. If TA-02 is any indication, I got some excellent results.&quot; Clogori explained, likely referring to Tarnas. He seemed to honestly believe in and to be very proud of his research. &quot;Plus, I don&#39;t see the High Council controlling the single most dangerous bio-weapon in existence. Thanks to my research, though, I <em>can</em>.&quot;

Efahz went to go sit down on the cot beside Adrova, muttering angrily to himself. Something about him being crippled, but it wasn&#39;t really audible. Adrova was still eating the food, taking occasional sips of the water. Efahz certainly didn&#39;t seem to be in a good mood, though.

Even though Efahz had given in for now, Kinsey still felt like they&#39;d lost the argument. They took a deep breath, reminding themself that Efahz&#39;s life was more important than his feelings at the moment. They <em>were</em> starting to feel as though protecting him was holding them back, but they&#39;d never dare say so. Not after their pep talk on Mars, trying to convince him to value himself more.

As soon as Kapak appeared behind them, Kinsey instinctively went into a madurai fighting stance and whipped around. Seeing it was just the massive Nidus, they forced themself to relax. &quot;Void, Doc, the muck are you doing sneaking around like that?&quot;

With another sigh, they turned back to Svy. &quot;Efahz has a lot of data on Clogori&#39;s antics. He&#39;s been a huge part in finding him so far.&quot; (they emphasized this with some extra volume, hoping Efahz would get the idea.) &quot;He can probably get you the info you need. Whether you&#39;re stupid enough to try and negotiate with the madman, well, that&#39;s up to you I guess.

The Nidus chuckled to himself and walked across the room, quickly making his way over to the kitchen area. He pulled out a ceramic and gold teapot, setting it overtop a machine that magnetically locked it into place as it heated it up using magnetic induction.
Kapak took the urn, which he had set upon the countertop, and opened it. He pulled out a fistful of dried leaves, each blade as flat as paper.
Soon enough, the water was simmering, and Kapak tossed the leaves into the top. He reached inside and twirled his finger through the brew thrice before sticking the lid of the pot back into place.
While Kapak waited for the mysterious potion to brew, he listened in to the surrounding conversations, but held his peace.</span>

&quot;{MAKING the warframes in the first place was a morally dubious prospect; augmenting them nowadays is par for the course.}&quot; Svytoj stated bluntly. &quot;{It&#39;s the fact that you left a streak of infested biomass strewn across Europa that is of my concern.}&quot;

~&quot;Yes, the contamination of Europa. I&#39;ve had some of my best teams cleaning up the mess there, and they&#39;ve been making fairly short work of it. I expect the area to be clear rather soon. I clean up after myself when possible.&quot; Clogori explained, the sounds of him walking being barely audible in the background. &quot;And the Europa incident did provide us with a great deal of information, and a massive breakthrough. From the samples, we found instances of the strain that had adapted to the cold temperatures without the need for a host body. Just think of what this could <em>mean</em>! We could drop some Technocyte on a Corpus base on Pluto, and let the Corpus forces get overwhelmed! No need for intervention!&quot; He seemed ecstatic about this, and Svytoj could almost hear him smiling.

&quot;As for Chegar, he may not agree with what I did, but he could truly make a difference! Not only could he vastly further improve our understanding of how the Technocyte develops and evolves, but he could gain <em>incredible</em> strength, speed, durability...&quot; Clogori sounded more and more excited as he went on, seeming to break the usual calm composure he had. &quot;Of course I would want to put every Tenno through a procedure like this. Think about it! Once I completely perfect the strain and alter it to allow for genetic variation in hosts, I could make the Tenno an even deadlier fighting force by many orders of magnitude!&quot;~

~Adrova sat on the cot, finishing off the rest of his food eventually. He hadn&#39;t realized how hungry he had been, and he had no idea it had been at least a few days since his last meal. Combine that with dying, and you end up with a fairly calorie-deprived Adrova. Drinking the rest of the water, he raised an eyebrow as Kapak made whatever it was that he was making.

Efahz, on the other hand, was sitting on a seperate cot, his body language full of frustration. He was wearing his helmet and therefore hiding facial expressions, but it was pretty clear that he wasn&#39;t happy about this. He didn&#39;t even seem to acknowledge anything that Kinsey said to Svytoj.~</span>

Without anything to really say to help Svytoj, and not wanting to bother Efahz with an apology until he&#39;d cooled off a bit, all they could do was lean against a wall and slide down to the floor. Boy, they&#39;d really mucked that one up. Suddenly they felt way out of their depth. Infestation, working with Tenno they&#39;d barely met, and a pair of Perrin operatives with some sort of death wish. <em>And it&#39;s cold and dark up here.</em>

Going silent, they pulled their knees up to their chest and rested their chin on it, returning to their standard resting bitch face - though maybe with a little extra grumpiness at the moment.</span>

There was a whistling as the teapot screamed out its finality.
&quot;Ah, excellent!&quot; Kapak snatched the vessel off of its magnetic boiler, grabbed a cup and carried it over to Adrova. He knelt down next to the Corpus, quickly looking the Corpus&#39; still mostly-naked body.
&quot;How are you feeling, pal?&quot; Kapak asked as he poured a cup of the steaming hot tea. &quot;Feel queasy at all? Headaches? Trouble breathing?&quot;
He held out the cup towards Adrova.
&quot;Careful, it&#39;s hot.&quot;
Kapak sat back as Adrova would take the cup.
&quot;That there is Ruk&#39;s Klaw tea. I learned it from... a friend. I studied the plant it comes from, native to Mars. It&#39;s got a bunch of varying stereoisomers that are completely unique. If you brew it wrong, you end up with a psychedelic chemical. If you brew it right, you can destroy the psychedelic and you end up with a tea complete with medicinal properties!&quot;
Kapak fingergunned Kinsey.
&quot;It really stimulates your hippocampus. Good for memory related mental wellbeing.&quot;
Kapak scratched his neck.
&quot;Although... sometimes some of that neat psychedelic stuff can be left over. Only a small portion of course- so there won&#39;t be anything... crazy.&quot;
Kapak paused for a moment, biting his thumb. He seemed to enter deep thought about something. His entire explanation of the drink seemed relatively sound, but there seemed to be something about his delivery that portrayed an unknowingness about what he was talking about.</span>

<em>To Clogori</em>
Svytoj gave a low sigh before continuing.
&quot;{Clogori... as a soldier, and a surgeon, <em>I</em> get it; it all sounds like an overall win for us. BUT, you need to consider this; the Orokin&#39;s use of the infestation left the out colonies in ruin. The Grineer barely kept it under control, and it only took one crazed researcher to let that nightmare loose. Even Alad V, as brilliant as he is, took his studies too far.}&quot; 
He said calmly, taking a moment to refocus before continuing. 
&quot;{You&#39;ve had a breach on Europa. Just looking outside here, you do not have this properly contained. Any breach, by any faction, is a breach too many. making something that is even more fit to overtake the outer systems, especially the icy moons, is just asking for disaster.}&quot; 
He continued.
&quot;{And I ain’t even got to the test subject aspect of this. Augmentation of the Warframes is one thing; But augmenting TENNO? Their connection to the void already has damaging effects on their minds; adding in the hive mind of the infestation could send them over the edge. Considering the last Tenno fought WAS Tarnas, his increased instability and lack of restraint is NOT a desired trait; you&#39;ll be building glorified ghouls; nothing more.}&quot;</span>

~&quot;If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? There was a breach here, but it was cleaned up in the end. Also, I would <em>hardly</em> consider this to be a breach. I allow the virus here to spread and grow here. Consider this to be another experiment. In this case, seeing how the strain survives on a larger scale. As you can see, it does quite well.&quot; Clogori seemed to be walking around somewhere very busy, judging from the sound of his and several other footsteps. Svytoj could also very faintly hear the hissing noises of doors opening. &quot;The Tarnas you met last time is long gone. Thanks to some breakthroughs we&#39;ve made, he&#39;s gone from unstable to completely under control. Under our control, at least. He&#39;s changed for the better. TA-02 is an example of what Telos could do for the Tenno.&quot;
&quot;That is exactly the reason I have Chegar. Or CH-01, now. He is a skilled fighter already, of course. With the application of our methods, though, he could reach a level beyond anything he could do now. And it would solve that whole issue of him running into combat without thinking. We could do the thinking for him.&quot;~

~&quot;Not queasy, but I do feel a little bit lightheaded, still. Nothing serious...&quot; His food and water consumed, Adrova put the dishes down and looked up at the Nidus. He would be intimidated, but he was honestly too confused still. Nothing since he had woken up was even slightly normal. Holding the cup carefully, he had a sip of the tea. &quot;Thanks, uh... for the food, and apparently bringing me back from the dead. Seriously, that&#39;s a lot of stuff you did.&quot;

&quot;Seeing as you two are more <em>prepared</em> to fight Clogori, you should probably just go. I can keep an eye on Adrova. Just go get Chegar back, and maybe kill all of those... things. I dunno.&quot; Efahz &#39;suggested&#39;. There was just a little bit of passive-agressiveness in his voice, and also a little bit of concern for Chegar. He glanced over at Adrova, and gestured for the room&#39;s exit. &quot;Who knows what Clogori&#39;s done to Chegar by now. Get this Svytoj guy to back you up, maybe. I don&#39;t care. Just go.

Hearing Kapak explain the tea to Adrova, the grumpy Tenno perked up a bit. Ruk&#39;s Klaw tea? Where had they heard of that before?

That thought was quickly swept from their mind, however, as Efahz spoke. He still sounded upset - and he had every right to be - but at least he seemed to have given in for now. Kinsey stood up and approached awkwardly, giving Adrova a quick smile. Seeing him safe and alive gave them a bit more confidence.

Making an effort to not invade Efahz&#39;s personal space for once, they came to a stop in front of the rest of their ragtag group and nodded in agreement. &quot;Efahz is right. We should get going before it&#39;s too late. We had a good reason to get sidetracked but I don&#39;t think that was time we could afford to lose. Doc, unless there&#39;s anything pressing you can&#39;t handle over comms, I&#39;d like to get back in that shithole and rescue Chegar.&quot;

Then, quietly, they added, &quot;Thank you, Efahz. I know you&#39;re still pissed but thank you.&quot;</span>

“You’re okay with them staying here?” Kapak turned and looked down at Kinsey, “I mean, they’ll be safe here, but most people find my ship pretty unsettling.”
Kapak cracked his knuckles, which echoed out at a disturbingly loud volume though the chamber.

Svytoj had heard enough. Chegar was no test subject, and if Clogori wasn&#39;t going to see that, the time for civil discourse had ended.
&quot;{And that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong; Europa wasn&#39;t a tree falling in the woods. it fell on Chegar&#39;s doorstep. And now it has fallen on mine.}&quot; Svytoj said, a slight crackle on the line betraying his no-tenno origins. &quot;{I&#39;ve Given you your chance, Clogori.}&quot;
And with that, Clogori&#39;s line to Svytoj went dead.
<em>To Kinsey</em>
&quot;{Self righteous, and self assured....}&quot; Svytoj paused.

&quot;{How do you want to proceed?}&quot;</span>

~&quot;listen, compared to the rest of this whole place, your ship looks nice and pleasent by comparison. At least nothing has tried to murder us so far, and that&#39;s honestly about how low my standards are now.&quot; Efahz said, leaning forward a little bit. Even with the helmet, his body language showed he was in a... poor mood and perhaps glaring at someone. &quot;Kill Clogori, get Chegar back here. We&#39;ll figure out some sort of escape plan or something once. We&#39;ll be fine here. Just do what you arrived here to do. Get in there, kill stuff, and come back.&quot;
Adrova, meanwhile, was too busy sipping tea to notice anything happening. It was quite good, and that was from someone didn&#39;t particularly like tea. Probably a side effect of the memory loss.</span>

&quot;We will. That&#39;s been my plan from the start. Clogori&#39;s fucked up for the last time with this one. We&#39;re gonna kick his ass and be back in time for dinner.

~&quot;What&#39;s your definition of damage? Are you gonna non-lethally supress me if I stub my toe on something?&quot; Efahz asked, seeming more annoyed about Helminth than Adrova was. Adrova was peacefully sipping his tea, still, like nothing especially crazy was happening around him. Even though there was. Like, a lot. Efahz resumed his mildly grumpy stare in the direction of the exit. Even though this wasn&#39;t his ship, it was clear he wanted the Tenno to leave.~

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
~The ship he was... no, <em>ships</em> he was approaching looked like something out of one&#39;s worst nightmares. Five Corpus ships, all joined at a section of the hull by a truly massive cluster of Infestation. Massive tendrils had spread to all five ships, which had varied from anywhere between a smaller gunship, and a full-sized Obelisk cruiser. The place he was looking for was the hangar of a smaller ship, which was also where the other two Tenno were going to head back to soon. Well, here&#39;s hoping that nothing went too wrong.~</span>

Noticing Efahz&#39;s glare, Kinsey nodded and gave an awkward wave goodbye to Adrova. &quot;We&#39;ll be back soon. If either of you need anything, have Doc&#39;s Cephalon contact us.&quot;

Deciding to end the topic there so as not to piss off Efahz any further, Kinsey turned to Kapak and gave a thumbs-up. &quot;Already there.&quot; they said, shortly before disappearing in a swirl of orange-gold particles and returning to their warframe, which was still sitting cross-legged and hunched over in Kapak&#39;s lander, positioned as though still supporting Adrova&#39;s head.

Leveret&#39;s shoulder still ached slightly, and he dimly recalled ramming it repeatedly into the stack of crates. Oh....and his hands and arms were still covered in Adrova&#39;s blood. He hurriedly tried to rub some off but only succeeded in smearing it. Sagging in defeat, Leveret climbed to his feet and waited for Kapak to appear.</span>

The Nidus snickered, but didn&#39;t say anything to the feisty Crewman before turning and entering the airlock.
Kapak&#39;s journey to his Landing Craft was short. Upon stepping through the airlock, more of Kapak&#39;s Engineers stood attentively to the side, each one holding up various equipment, almost as if in offering to him. He took one object from each:
First, a small, wriggling, living weapon that pulsated softly to the touch. A Tysis, which Kapak fastened to his thigh by allowing the weapon&#39;s tentacles to wrap around the limb.
Second, a steel canister with a wide glass viewing panel in its side. It displayed a blue fluorescent substance within. Kapak fastened this with a strap to his back.
Next, wicked looking dagger that looked like it hand been carved from bone. In its hilt, a fleshy heart beat, almost mirroring the mutant nidus&#39; own exposed cardiac muscle-resembling organ. Poison dripped from the tip and spread across the blade. A single Ichor, which Kapak stored by swiftly stabbing the entirety of the weapon into his own gut. His flesh swallowed more and more of the weapon until just half of the weapon&#39;s grip was exposed. 
Lastly, rusted, ancient Orokin firearm, the Tigris Prime, browned with corrosion and scratched with action. It shared the same form as the beautifully crafted weapons from the Orokin age, yet its paint was marred with scuffmarks, and its once brilliant gold finish had been stripped away- only in certain angles did the dim light of Kapak&#39;s orbiter instigate a flash off of the weapon&#39;s metallic surfaces.
Once fully equipped, Kapak swiftly carried himself to the Landing Craft segment, next to the Chroma.
&quot;Excellent. All ready? Because here we go!&quot; He snapped his fingers, and the ramp behind the two Warframes hissed shut. There was a clunk as the ship disengaged, and then a light tug as it accelerated back towards the next of Infestation-ravaged vessels.

&quot;&#39;Throw it as hard as possible against a solid surface and make sure you&#39;re at least 40 meters away,&#39;&quot; Kapak quoted, &quot;I don&#39;t know what this thing is exactly, but if that Arbiter wasn&#39;t exaggerating, we&#39;ve got one Void of an ace in the hole here.&quot;
He shrugged and thumbed the canister on his back.
&quot;I know what you&#39;re wondering. &#39;What&#39;s in the canister?&#39; I could tell you... but then I&#39;d have to kill you.&quot; The Nidus paused with a sinister grin for a moment before playfully punching the Chroma&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Hehe, I&#39;m only muckin&#39; about. Relax. As for what&#39;s in the canister? Modified Corpus Antiserum, or MCA if you want to sound really cool. Corpus Antiserum is still one of the most effective Infesticides on the market to date, since the only thing better than it is Thrax Toxin, which also happens to be illegal to use thanks to its neurotoxicology.&quot; Kapak reached backwards- did he just unhinge his arm??- and flicked the side of the container. &quot;This is a proprietary brew, created as a part of a deal with... with my... my old boss. It&#39;s at least 10 times more potent against Technocytes while remaining safe to use around civilians and other targets. Also, it doesn&#39;t linger for like 5 months like Thrax Toxin does. I figured it might come in handy at some point, but just keep in mind this stuff isn&#39;t unlimited. Also, this is kinda in a raw liquid form- we&#39;d need a machine in order to disperse it as a mist. Although, I won&#39;t lie, using it to splash a fathermucker also works.&quot;
Kapak&#39;s arm returned to normal.
&quot;There&#39;s enough MCA inside this thing to kill me, actually. Oh, look, we&#39;re here!&quot;
As soon as the last comment left Kapak&#39;s mouth, the ship had returned to the hangar that they&#39;d departed from only a couple hours ago.

~The hangar was absolutely dead-silent, still. Nothing detected by motion sensors, and minimal life-signs seen in the Infested growths. For a ship so utterly filled with the Infested, this was unusual, of course. The smell of coolant and decay was still present, as strong as ever. Everything just seemed so... dead. So still, and lifeless. The large doors on the other side of the hangar seemed to be beckoning the group toward it, once again. The same way they had gone before. Where they had found Frez and Efahz, and where they had been fighting for their lives mere hours before. The most direct path to the center of this cluster, and to Clogori.~</span>

After quickly making sure a new moustache was fixed to his face, Kapak waltzed down the back ramp of his ship, careful not to bump his head on the top as he descended.
He breathed in, taking in the vile, stale, musty aroma that permeated the entire ship. That sickening yet comforting smell- so familiar and yet so unnerving.
He lightly pushed Leveret&#39;s Ignis to the side as he passed the Chroma, approaching the Frost as he landed in the hangar next to them.
&quot;Ah hello!&quot; Kapak said with a grin, stretching out his hand, &quot;I&#39;m the Plague Doctor. You must be... Swytov? Cephalon Shytaw? Huh, how about that- you&#39;re no Tenno, and yet you command a Warframe. Fascinating...&quot; Kapak trailed off before shrugging and pointing at the open hallway.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure this won&#39;t be the strangest thing I&#39;ll see today. And I&#39;m sure <em>I</em> won&#39;t be the strangest thing <em>you</em> see today, either. Trust me, I may look like those Infested experiments, but I am quite not like them.&quot;
Kapak gave Svytoj a reassuring grin as he finished off his introduction.
&quot;From what I heard, friend, Glocori contacted you. Tried triangulating the source of the signal?&quot;</span>

The scimitar didn’t even enter the hangar; is swooped passed as the white and green frost launched themself into the bay,Touching down roughly two meters to the aft left of Kapak.
“Didn’t get the chance; ironically, Chegar’s more the techie than me.” Svytoj replied dryly. “ BUT, I do keep records of on my ships position, not mention time and strength logs of incoming transmissions. So we should be able to get a rougher idea of where Clogori is.” He continued, walking past Kapak before stopping mid stride, and facing the nidus. “Oh... and it’s pronounced ‘Sveye-tauge’. “</span>

He gave Svy a friendly pat on the shoulder before turning his attention to the spooky corridor beyond. &quot;Now that everyone&#39;s here, let&#39;s get moving. We got a Tenno to save.&quot;

<em>Mucking bloody Void, really?</em> Kapak shivered at the thought of Thrax Toxin in action. He&#39;d tested small concentrations on samples of his own flesh and- well, he could feel his own body crying out in pain.
&quot;You guys keep moving on ahead. I&#39;ll catch up.&quot; Kapak moved off to the side, setting his shotgun on the ground. He planted his gnarly fingers into the flesh of the ship again, rooting around within the fibrous meat for more eyespot-linked nerves would let him look around the vessel for clues.

~This part seemed familiar to Leveret. The twisted flesh-like substances coating the walls/floors/ceiling, structural damage from years of corrosion and disrepair, and generally a... disturbing appearance, to say the least. There were even a few scars here and there of their previous fighting, not healed over yet. That was odd. The Infestation wasn&#39;t moving and shifting like it normally did. The expansion and contraction from the &#39;breathing&#39; that the growths did was still present, but far slower. Almost like it was asleep, or something. Still alive, but not responsive.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~Unfortunately, the &#39;sleeping&#39; Infestation didn&#39;t exactly make Kapak&#39;s plan easy. Or possible, for that matter. He got an image of things that were indeed happening, but it was very dim and blurry. The Infestation rarely acted like this, if ever. It seemed to him (as he was probably an experr on this) that the growths suddenly had much fewer nutrients than they normally did, but the cause was unknown.~</span>

Though distracted with thoughts of how to rescue Chegar, Leveret couldn&#39;t help but notice the infestation acting...odd.

&quot;Is it just me,&quot; he mused, prodding  a mass on the wall with the barrel of his ignis, &quot;or is this stuff not as squishy-breathey as it should be?&quot;

He glanced back at Kapak who turned out to still be way behind them. “Doc, you got any idea what’s going on?&quot; he called, &quot;Seems like something’s wrong with the gushy bits.”

After giving the mass on the wall another quick prod, Leveret picked up the pace again, not seeming to care about the various pustules and mushy globs he was stepping in. He did his best to try and follow the path they’d originally taken, hoping they could retrace their steps and maybe get a clue where Chegar had gone. Unfortunately, it didn’t even occur to him that Chegar may have gone in a different direction altogether.</span>

After a few moments, Kapak had caught back up to the other two.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m as good as blind in terms of &#39;hacking in&#39;,&quot; he announced, &quot;so I sure as Void hope you two have better way of finding your way throughout this place.&quot;

~Indeed, everything seemed malnourished. Slightly off-colored, and barely even moving. This wasn&#39;t just a fast change, this was borderline impossible. Did they run out of food? Is it all being drained somehow? One thing was for sure, though. There was even more wrong with this place than normal. The creatures of the Infestation are also seemingly dormant, as there is simply no sign of them. There wasn&#39;t a ping on a motion sensor, or anything big on thermal scans.  It was easy to retrace their steps, nothing coming to impede their progress this time.~

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
~How long has it been now? Minutes? Hours? Days? Weeks? Even months? Unknown. Nothing makes sense like it used to. He hasn&#39;t left his cell, though. The voice in his head has come to drown out or overpower most other thoughts, and Chegar is even able to put a name to it. Telos. Not the project, but an individual. Yes, Telos. That was the presence in his mind. It feels, too, like Chegar has become more... powerful, for lack of a better word. The mutations on his Frame had grown and flourished, and the growths spreading on the walls seem to be prospering now. The more it grew, the more a vague sense of security was instilled in Chegar.~</span>

&quot;More likely that he bailed,&quot; Kapak commented, lightly kicking a tumorous mound of flesh that was popping through the metal floor.
&quot;Let&#39;s face it: this guy knew that WE knew he was on the ship. Of course, he knew that already, but now he&#39;s fully aware of the backup you picked up.&quot;
Kapak pointed a thumb at himself before pointing at Svytoj.
&quot;He might do something stupid like lure us deep into this ship and then detonating its reactor core. It&#39;s not a fun way to die.&quot; Something seemed like the Nidus had gone through this before.

~Oddly enough, there were very few security systems still visibly functioning. Most cameras seemed to be completely inoperable, and those that did work were barely doing so. If they were being watched, it probably wasn&#39;t through a camera. How else, though? Seeing as next to nothing on this ship worked, the likelihood of any alternate Corpus security measures working were... unlikely, to say the least. There were terminals here and there, but all had been engulfed by the Infested growths, and were invariably lacking power. They mat have gotten a terminal working earlier, but clearly something was affecting this ship. By comparison, everything was so... alive, earlier. The further they went into the ship, though, things seemed to change. It was subtle, but the growths further into the ship seemed to be faring slightly better and better. They almost had a sustainable supply of nutrition. The electronics, however, still failed to function.~</span>

&quot;Actually, it seems like the mushy bits are...back to being mushing. I think I can hear the walls squelching.&quot; he commented, avoiding a slippery-looking patch of goo on the floor. &quot;Was it a passing thing? Or is it based on location?&quot;</span>

&quot;It&#39;s in muscular formations,&quot; Kapak said, running his hands across the glistening surfaces of the wallbound flesh, &quot;crushing the ship into a shape more suited for its survival.&quot;
Something clicked in his head as Kapak paused for a moment.
&quot;Oh, Void! I&#39;m a total dingnut. This isn&#39;t the only ship, is it? There&#39;s a whole network of Infestation that&#39;s branched out across several ships, isn&#39;t there?&quot; Kapak planted his hands on his hips.
&quot;There must be- forgive me- a nidus where the Infestation originated from. All massive derelicts in Eris&#39; orbit grow a similar way- the center of origin is always the most Infested, and everything around it tends to get pulled towards it.&quot;
He pointed to the pulsating flesh over the terminals and floors.
&quot;I suspect it wasn&#39;t a passing thing, my frosty dragon friend. I think we&#39;re closing in on the center.&quot;
Kapak turned to face down the hallway before them.
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s really the only lead we have. Might as well try it- just keep your eyes peeled. You&#39;ll need your wits sharp and your blades sharper- might be more of those bloody Infested Warframes or more heavily mutated organisms.&quot;
Kapak quickly pulled open his Tigris&#39; breach block to ensure it was loaded. He was met with the reassuring glint of the golden shells that sat waiting.
Kapak cracked a smile before closing the chamber and twirling the shotgun around his finger.
&quot;Groovy.&quot;
He marched forwards, quickly, but cautiously. He glanced over his shoulder and nodded to the others as if to say <em>let&#39;s go!</em>.</span>

~The further they went, the more a pattern was established in the Infested. The more they progressed toward the aft of the ship and the location where the ships intersected, the more healthy the growths were. If they ever went in any other direction, they would observe the opposite happening. There was, a tad eerily, a faint growling that became audible as they progressed more, and the appendeges became more prevalent. Honestly, it might be from the Technocyte itself, and not a creature.~

~The further they got into the ship, the more and more they came across various Corpus proxies. In the storage areas closer to the hangar they had entered through, the racks normally full of MOAs and other robots were almost completely empty. In here, though, they were everywhere. The racks overflowed, and many had been stacked and leaned against walls. They had all been affected by the Infestation, and some seemed to be falling apart to a degree. All sorts of MOAs, Ospreys, Lynxes, and a few Jackals. Enough for a normal ship, but all stored here. Unusual.~</span>

“No, not at this point,” Kapak responded to Svytoj, “looks the same from a physiological standpoint. Standard Infested phenotypes all throughout these growths.”
Kapak wagged his finger towards the flesh as they walked.
“Could have alterations in the genetics. I’d have to analyze it later.”
Kapak eyed the Corpus proxies wearily.
“Watch out for those mucking robots, eh? Ever since Alad V introduced that Mutalist genome into the strain it’s been causing all kinds of trouble.”
Kapak watched the spongy bun of Infestation wobble and jiggle as Leveret kicked it.
“Armed to the teeth? Heh, well I tell you, usually I go into things with my bare hands. But since we’re dealing with hostile Tenno- well, I can’t just try to punch a Warframe and hope to blow out its abdomen.”

&quot;Last time I was in Eris&#39; orbit I was working with this psychopath chick,&quot; Kapak continued on, elaborating on the tale Leveret brought up, &quot;she was convinced she could use her Warframe to command all of the Infestation around, like some kind of hive mother. Let me tell you, it did not go over well for her.&quot;
Kapak looked at his hand, remembering events that had gone by. The feel in his hands as he had snapped his opponent&#39;s Warframe&#39;s neck with his bare hands.
&quot;Anyways, what do you think you&#39;ll do with Yoriyorki when we catch him? Kill him? Imprison him? You should probably try to let me know ahead of time so I don&#39;t... you know, take matters into my own hands. Not that I can guarantee anything.&quot;</span>

&quot;I must admit, I do enjoy getting blood on my hands,&quot; Kapak said as he casually grabbed a nearby Moa&#39;s leg, his claw-like grasp digging into the armour plating before wrenching the appendage from the metal body. He looked at it before tossing it aside and continuing to move forward. &quot;but I would, if it&#39;s possible, like to capture this guy first. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m not interested in his work. It&#39;s not possible to Infest a Tenno, but controlling one is the next best thing...&quot;
Kapak trailed off for a moment before stopping and halting all movement. The glowing, reddish-purple boils that coated the Nidus&#39; fleshy blend of bones seemed to fizzle out for a moment. But it wasn&#39;t long before he shook his head and continued to move.
&quot;Whew! Boy, don&#39;t you hate it when you lose connection to your Warframe for a moment? At least it didn&#39;t happen in the middle of combat.&quot;
Kapak continued on, periodically sniffing the air for any pheromones- a possible warning of attack or acknowledgement of their presence.
&quot;Think this guy&#39;s watching us? He&#39;s more than a ravenous horde of mutated flesh, so I&#39;d imagine he must have some way to keep tabs on his territory.&quot;
Kapak paused by another lumpy mound of flesh, gazing into the glossy surface. He could try to hook into the Technocyte&#39;s nervous system again and take another look around.</span>

Although he didn&#39;t seem to concerned when Kapak paused, his comment on why he&#39;d stopped raised a red flag or two in Leveret&#39;s mind. Losing connection? And the way he said it made it sound like this wasn&#39;t the first time. 
&quot;What? No, that doesn&#39;t happen to me regularly. Last time I had any trouble with connection was when I went k-driving without a warframe and got a concussion. Does this happen a lot? I don&#39;t want to have to drag your lifeless frame around.&quot;</span>

~The trio find themselves in a much more open room. Really, they were in that room with the three seperate &#39;bridges&#39; and the transport rails that seem to be quite common on Corpus ships. Much fewer MOAs in here, but there was a single Jackal lying dormant to the left, lying in a rather inconvenient spot across one of the &#39;bridges&#39;. There were crates knocked over from their once-neat piles and stacks. The particulate of Technocyte hung in the air, mixing with the dust floating around. The growths squelched and growled all around them, writhing slightly. It all sounded more like an... animal, than a collection of Technocyte.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~The pheromones in the air give the impressiom that the creatures are being ordered to be dormant for now, but there&#39;s also a bit of... agression. Unease. They don&#39;t want any of you here. Without much searching, though, he finds an excellent eyespot. The growths here are much healthier. As a result, the images he recieves are much, much clearer. He can see the actions of the Infested withing several rooms. There are many little alcoves hidden behind walls, likely corroded and torn away by Infested. It all looks like... well, a safe haven. These tiny little alcoves. Maggots rolled and squirmed around, and tendrils writhed. Were these some sort of storage area?~</span>

Picking up on the hint that he wouldn&#39;t make any traction with Kapak, he made a kind of quiet grumpy noise and kept walking until Kapak stopped to prod the walls for eyespots or whatever. It wasn&#39;t very obvious to Leveret what the Nidus was doing, but he imagined it was even more gross up close.

&quot;Eugh. It&#39;s like walking around in a giant stomach, but with pustules.&quot; He grumbled, &quot;Can&#39;t wait to get this dealt with and get the muck outta here.&quot;</span>

&quot;Oh boy, I tell you, this is nowhere near as bad as walking around inside a giant stomach,&quot; Kapak clarified as he pulled his fingers from the meat.
&quot;Alright, so what I&#39;ve found is that the walls in all the surrounding rooms are filled with holes, and those are subsequently filled with a whole bunch of gestating maggots and other Infested organisms. Best not to wake &#39;em up- they&#39;re dormant right now, but not entirely oblivious to us. It almost seems like we&#39;re entering some kind of breeding grounds with the Infested structures that are growing here.&quot;
Kapak snuck a quick peek over the side of the bridge railing into the pits below them.
&quot;And watch your step, of course,&quot; he whispered- although it was more of a bold hiss.
The Nidus began to ease forward along the center bridge- each step placed cautiously, as the tumors and sinew that had warped this ship may have inflicted unseen structural damage to an already precarious location. Kapak pointed forward with his shotgun, waving with his other hand to beckon his comrades forward, silently.</span>

~Looking around, the breeding area theory seemed likely. The growths here were definitely a bit more thick, and who knew how many of those alcoves there were? Or how many maggots lived in those alcoves? Could there be even more hidden around? Long story short, this was definitely an unsafe place to be. It might be a sign that they were closer to the source, though. Whether that was a good thing or not, well...~

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
~Luckily for him, Svytoj could track down a port. This Jackal had been slowly corroded and replaced by the Infestation growing upon it, but it was still functional. Well, it was in a hibernation mode. Fairly functional, at least. It was unknown if the thing could even walk, though. Weapons might work, but it was hard to tell. At least the dataport was clean, though.~

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
~Okay, short post here. Likely by complete and utter chance, Leveret picked up a... communication? Who could be communicating out here? It was quiet and of a low quality, but audible. Maybe it was using a similar frequency?

&quot;Eugh, well, glad I brough an Ignis, then.&quot; He grumbled, deciding it would probably be best to stop kicking things now.

&quot;Doc said he lost connection with his frame? Beats me, th-&quot;

Leveret suddenly went silent mid-sentence, as though listening. &quot;Shh-shh-shh! Wait!&quot; he hissed, trying to hear whatever it was more clearly. The signal was spotty at best, ugh. He slapped the side of his head a few times, wondering if something had been jostled loose. &quot;I hear something...&quot; he whispered. &quot;Sounds like....a comms channel?&quot;</span>

~The communications continued, but they seemed to be between different people now. With a bit more adjustment, the audio would become much more clear, although there were still disturbances in the signal. Might be as close as they were going to get, though.

&quot;The boss wants everything ready within the hour. Status on subject recovery?&quot; That same voice that had talked to Clogori earlier was speaking. They seemed just a little bit more relaxed now, though. &quot;And do you think you could send someone down here with a coffee? Boss has been extending my shift lately.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll send an intern. But I just, uh... checked in with the rest of the science team. TA-02 has been sedated and is ready for redeployment. AL-01 is prepped.&quot; This was a new voice. Still mostly indistinguishable and normal, but it was clearly either Corpus or human. &quot;FE-01 should be prepared within the hour, assuming minimal deviation from schedule.&quot;

&quot;Alright, that&#39;s good. The boss seems pretty stressed right now. Can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s the new subject, or DCV-1R. Both have a pretty high risk.&quot; The first voice responded, and there were sounds in the background like they were leaning back in their seat. &quot;Can&#39;t blame him. CH-01 is still pretty unstable, and DCV is just... Well, you read the file.&quot;

~Most of the components like the radio scanner have been corroded away by the Infestation. It seemed like it was just down to weapons, and <em>maybe</em> mobility. A few more recordings could be found, and they seemed to all be within about a month of each other. So, it was working intermittently for that month, before it was shut down again until now. Maybe a bit of an unusual timeline, to be honest.

Joining Kapak on the other side of the bridge, Leveret waited for Svytoj to do...whatever he was doing. In the meantime, he continued listening in on the comms channel they&#39;d stumbled upon. &quot;Rahm, how many of these mucked-up frames has he got? They&#39;ve dropped like four names in thirty seconds.&quot; he whispered. &quot;Mucker&#39;s probably hiding behind a whole army of them.&quot;

Still, despite all the evidence that this mission would get his two Perrin friends killed, he found he felt horrible about leaving Efahz behind.

&quot;Hey uh, Doc? You think I should apologize?&quot; he asked, forgetting that the first half of his train of thought wasn&#39;t, you know, audible.</span>

Kapak waved his gun.
&quot;Well, I guess you could&#39;ve left them somewhere far more hospitable, I understand that. But on the other hand, there is no way they&#39;ll have any harm come to them where they are- I can assure you that. Watch, once this whole thing is over they&#39;ll forgive you.&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah. I guess I have been. Efahz seemed really upset about having to stay behind. I keep telling him he doesn&#39;t have to die for this and all that - void, Adrova basically <em>did</em> - but. Muck, I don&#39;t know. I guess I figured he&#39;d be okay with sticking back and keeping an eye on Adrova.&quot;

He sighed, a bit of off-white mist emerging from his helmet. &quot;It was probably something I said, or something. I guess I got kinda angry at him, too.&quot;

Leveret tried to think back and figure out where exactly the conversation escalated, but he only remembered afterwards, when Efahz had plopped down on one of the cots and began to radiate grumpiness to rival Adrova&#39;s.</span>

~Everything around them was still mostly still. Just the rhythmic squelching and... breathing. Best way to describe it, really. The floor was breathing, the walls were breathing... Gosh, the Infestation was gross sometimes. No offense, Kapak. Still, though, nothing&#39;s leaped out to attack them. Not yet. Just like that, though, there&#39;s more talking on the comms. Guess who&#39;s back. 

&quot;Sir, there are reports of maggots appearing in the transference storage. No damage as of yet. Should we do anything about that?&quot; That same person asked. Maybe this was just their job. &quot;Engineers think there might be some corrosion in the vents. Might explain how they got in.&quot;

There was just a bit of hesitation, before the answer came from a familiar voice. &quot;Capture the maggots, please, and have a talk with TE-01. This is the fifth incident this month. They have a lot to keep track of, but do so anyways. We can&#39;t have any of the pods getting damaged.&quot; Clogori answered, in his usual calm and collected voice. &quot;And let the neccessary people know we may be departing early.&quot;

~First, the most recent log. From the point of view of the Jackal as it looked around, it seemed the Infestation had spread already. Not a surprise, though. Eris was contaminated years ago. Oddly enough, though, it seemed to be on a patrol. It marched through the squelching corridors of the ship, almost as if it was oblivious to it. It wandered through corridors the group had passed through mere moments ago. For several minutes (likely sped-up), it just continued to do patrols without anything interesting happening. This was interrupted by an intercom announcement, though, made by a certain mad scientist.

&quot;Commencing first Proxy test of primary Telos subjects FE-01, AL-01, and TE-01. Subjects may engage when ready.&quot; Clogori announced calmly. &quot;Objective is to disable Jackal unit by any means.&quot;

The Jackal gave no indication it had noticed this, just continuing the patrol of the hallways. It wasn&#39;t for another minute before anything was noticed. By now, the Jackal was standing before the three bridges the group were currently standing on. The view shaked a bit, as one of the Jackal&#39;s legs was almost pulled out from under it. The vague shape of an Oberon descended in front of it, immediately lunging forward with a twisted Infested blade, which pierced the chassis right in a weak point. The Jackal attempted to open fire on the infected Oberon before it, none of the shots hitting their mark. The Jackal was dragged backward by whatever had grabbed the leg, as the Oberon pulled the sword out and stood back. It just... stopped fighting. There was a moment of complete silence, before a new Tenno entered view. Or, at least, the bottom half of one. A Nidus, to be specific. It wasn&#39;t running, though. Just... walking. The Jackal tried to lift itself to open fire, but no avail. There was another silent pause, before the recording cut off with the Nidus taking up the entire field of view.

The Nidus was too busy watching the video feed to even listen for the communication transmission.
&quot;Well I dunno about anything about the Transference, but it would make sense that this fathermucker has access to some Somatic pods for his Tenno.&quot;
Kapak lifted a finger, &quot;That Oberon though- I killed him. Or at least, the Warframe is dead. Completely obliterated it to pieces. Chegar was there when I did it...&quot;
Kapak looked over his shoulder to across the bridge to where Svytoj and the Jackal was.
&quot;This place is weird though... that proxy was obviously nothing more than a practice target... but it hasn&#39;t been cleaned up.  And there&#39;s no standardized testing area it seems...&quot;

He cocked his head as he fell in, obviously thinking of something.
&quot;DCV-1R...the designation alone makes it sound like something other than one of those infested &#39;frames. Not  to mention the way Clogori&#39;s team reacts to it.&quot; Svytoj said.

~Ahead, things were looking... more and more gross. Really. They ended up back in quite a standard hallways once again, away from whatever was in that last room. Breeding ground, testing area, who knows? Regardless, Kapak would detect a bit of a change from the pheromones, that hint of agression being less noticable here. This room seemed to be mostly unremarkable at first glance, with the expection of the even thicker Infested growths. It almost looked like it had begun eating the ship itself, with railings and walls partially corroded away. It was too much to just be a byproduct of the presence of Technocyte. They didn&#39;t dissolve Corpus alloys this quickly.~</span>

&quot;Either that or he&#39;s been here for a short while and has some kind of aggressive strain tearing through these ships.&quot;
Kapak knelt down and inspected the decaying metal.
&quot;This isn&#39;t good. Technocyte must be absorbing a ton of metal from the ships. It could be used to really up the toughness in Infested organisms... Might be part of the whole Infested Warframes project that it looks like we&#39;re dealing with. Tougher armour, you know?&quot;

~Things were silent at first, in this room. Well, besides the squelching. At first, at least. it was silent. Slowly, Kapak would notice the aggressive pheremones coming back again. It was gradual, but still a possible threat.  Eventually, the other two would start to hear a very faint growling coming from... above? It wasn&#39;t like the noises the growths made normally. No, this was much more akin to a single, aggressive creature. It was unclear what it was at this point, but that growling was starting to get louder.

<em>Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. CRASH.</em> The source of the noise smashed through the ceiling, right in the middle of the group. The ground shaked and the impact reverberated through the corridors. The source? A massive, towering mass of Infestation and shrieking. A juggernaut. Clogori&#39;s created a juggernaut.  That wasn&#39;t the end of the group&#39;s problems, though. Standing on the heavily-reinforced shell of this gargantuan pile of rage, was the silhouette of a Warframe. A Valkyr, to be precise. Seems they were at least partially right with their prediction. In a single moment, the twisted and infested Valkyr had used a ripline to fling themself at the ceiling, as the Juggernaut roared yet again, and metallic spikes flew out of the hide in nearly every direction. Oh, they looked quite deadly. One could probably at least temporarily cripple a Frame, if it hit anywhere even remotely vital. There were a lot of them, though, flying in every direction.</span>

As soon as the scraping turned into a crash, brownish-white mist puffed from Leveret’s helmet and a thick layer of icy armor formed around everyone in the group. 

He had spun to face the source of the crash, realizing in a split second that the thing was <em>close</em> and his shield would serve him better. He readied it just in time to block a metal spike from pegging his shoulder, and it was deflected with a loud clang. The thing was powerful enough to leave a small dent in his shield, but that didn’t stop him from activating his electromagnetic shielding. Orange-gold beams of light linked Leveret to his allies, managing to bend some spikes into a less lethal path. Unfortunately, they were too powerful to redirect completely. Leveret cursed in grineer, adding a few personal insults directly toward the Valkyr.

“YOU KILLED ADROVA, YOU TWISTED POXXY HYEKKA!” He yelled, more puffs of offwhite mist emerging from his helm.</span>

“Now this is more like it,” he said with a grin.
The Nidus shuddered at first as the frigid armour manifested itself on his flesh. But it was well worth it; once the Infested spines made contact with it, they deflected off of the armour into the wall, floor and ceiling.
Kapak marched forward towards the Juggernaut, before assuming a defiant stance before the monster. He spun his shotgun in his hand and spoke:
“It’s playtime, buddy.”
Kapak rushed forward towards the Juggernaut at full speed, his Tigris Prime in in hand and saliva dripping from his mouth.</span>

The juggernaut shrieked again, as it charged at Kapak. This enraged, screaming, gargantuan mass of Infested tissue preparing to crush Kapak. Then again, this was Kapak. The beast leaped up, preparing to crush Kapak. While it exposed the unarmored part of the juggernaut, there was even a layer of tougher flesh where there would be a defenseless weak point. Maybe that&#39;s where some of that consumed metal went.

The Valkyr threw a ripline right beside Svytoj as the icy bolt hit them in the arm not currently holding the line. While it seems the bolt had done its job and weakened the Valkyr as it flung itself at Svytoj, it didn&#39;t take much for the Infested Tenno to shatter the ice. A second later, the glowing claws were out, and pointed toward the Frost as the Valkyr picked up even more speed.

As for Leveret, it would seem he wasn&#39;t being left out. Through the door behind him, he could hear many stampeding footsteps. The source of the noise became clear when a horde of infected Crewmen ran through, all singling out the Chroma.</span>

&quot;We got more incoming!&quot; he yelled, gripping his axe a bit tighter in anticipation of the amount of hacking and slashing he was about to do. He activated his vex armor and braced himself, taking a deep breath as well, holding it in his chest.

Leveret could feel the cold air building up as he waited to unleash it on the incoming horde, and he released it as soon as the runners in the front got close enough. He exhaled as long and hard as he could, hoping to freeze a makeshift wall of infested to slow down the ones behind, even a little bit.</span>

<em>Hmm. That’s new,</em> Kapak thought as he regarded the unexpectedly tougher underside of the Juggernaut. At the very least, the dumb beast had exposed itself, meaning Kapak had free room to project two shots from his Tigris straight into the belly. The Nidus dropped into a slide, hopefully managing to evade the Juggernaut’s massive weight by gliding across the floor straight under the creature’s legs.</span>

The motion was fluid. Svytoj drew his redeemer, slashing through infested flesh holding the rip line. He snatched the tether, pivoted on his heals, and swung both arms down, pulling the rip line in an arc towards the floor. He kept an eye on the now, hopefully, floor-bound Valkyr, readying himself for their next move.</span>

~The wall of ice and infested delayed the onslaught by a few moments, luckily. Just a few moments, though. It didn&#39;t take long for them to start running around or climbing over. It didn&#39;t take much longer after that for a few of them to smash their way through the ice wall. It did manage to buy him long enough to hopefully really get his bearings. After that, though, this wave of infected crewmem started to rush him once again. When one died, another would just use that dead body as a shield to aid their own advance. Even a few ancients could be seen stepping through the doorway, beginning their slow march to the Chroma.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~The shot was thankfully not completely stopped by the armor. The beast roared, and immediately turned around to charge the Nidus while he was still on the ground. It really did seem to hate Kapak in particular, but that might be due to the fact that he had shot it. The ground shook with every step as it got ready to ram Kapak at full speed. There was almost certainly a lot of weight behind it as it moved.~

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
~The Valkyr hit the floor in a surprisingly fluid motion, immediately rolling back up and continuing to Svytoj on foot. It seemed the Tenno was also quite fast, as it broke out into a full sprint before leaping up and preparing for an overhand attack with all claws. It would seem the loss of the ripline only impeded the Valkyr slightly, as its attack continued. In a state like this, too, it would likely take a lot to do any major damage or even slow it down.~</span>

&quot;We got ancients over here!&quot; he called, more as a warning than anything else. He didn&#39;t want Kapak of Svytoj to end up backing into one, or getting grappled from out of nowhere.

Leveret braced himself for the attacks that he knew would come as he readied another blast of cold, relying on his shield and armor abilities to keep him from being ripped apart.</span>

&quot;OOF&quot; Kapak managed to wheeze as the creature slammed into him. Kapak&#39;s open mouth heaved up several of his internal organs, spilling a vile mixture of blood and flesh across the top of the Juggernaut&#39;s shell as it charged forward, carrying Kapak with it.
&quot;That... ouch...&quot; Kapak pulled himself up slowly as the creature charged forward still, still managing to maintain a grip on his Tigris, which was empty and now needed to be reloaded. Except...
<em>Oh muck,</em> Kapak realized as he hung on, <em>Those shells were inside me.</em>
He could feel his internals healing and growing back, but there was fat chance he could reload his weapon now. He looked behind the Juggernaut and saw his Ichor also sitting in the pile of innards on the floor. That left him with only the MCA canister on his back, but he&#39;d prefer not to use it just yet...</span>

~The relentless onslaught continued, the infected crewmen doing their best to wear down the Chroma as the ancients made their slow approach. Body after body, doing their best to break through and actually attack Leveret. The dead ones just became shields for the ones still moving. Maybe they couldn&#39;t to much damage with the shield or armor, but Leveret would likely find it difficult to escape this horde. Even more so, actually. Once the ancients entered, accompanied by a few more infested creatures, a familiar event took place. Every single door slammed shut at that moment, and the lights began to dim. Just like the first ambush, the group was now stuck in here. With a juggernaut and one of Clogori&#39;s creations, and an angry horde of Infested.~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
~The juggernaut ended the first charge after Kapak&#39;s internal organs were vomited all over it. Not out of disgust, but likely to prepare to finish off the Nidus. It stepped back a few meters, ground shaking with each step, before freezing in place for a moment. With another ear-piercing screech, it charged once again at Kapak. It seemed to be moving even faster than last time, and judging by its position, seeked to charge through the Nidus and into the wall, in what would leave any normal enemy as a stain of blood and a few fragmented bones.~

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
~Most of the bullets embedded themselves in the top layer of Infested flesh, and none seemed to slow the Valkyr down. As Svytoj dodged attack after attack, the Valkyr became angrier and faster, slashing relentlessly with the intent to destroy the Frost. During one of these attacks, one of the clawed hands attempted to disarm Svytoj, trying to rip the soma out of his hand.~</span>

Fully occupied with defending himself against the seemingly unending stream of infested, Leveret almost didn’t notice when the doors slammed shut. <em>Doors are closed. Hopefully that’ll slow the tide of infested soon.</em>

Running out of room to fight, Leveret quickly ducked down and his pelt freed itself from his back with a deafening, screeching roar. He backed up as best he could, now a bit less armored without the heavy pelt.

Giving the effigy a chance to let loose another blast of cold, Leveret refreshed the icy amor on himself and his companions. His vex armor had been soaking up quite a bit of damage so far, and he decided to put it to use with powerful swings of his axe, which only grew in force the more he attacked.</span>

The Soma goes Flying, streaking across the room in a flash of gold. But as soon as the rifle went flying, the Frost&#39;s hand was already on his redeemer,  Parrying against the infested Valkyr&#39;s claws as he continued to dodge. Barely thinking, Svytoj bats a claw away with his gunblade, and grabs hastily for on of the imbedded spines. with the quill in hand, He flips it point up, and rams the quill towards the Valkyr&#39;s head.</span>

With the effigy slowing down more of the horde, Leveret would be able to dispatch the more immediate threat without any real issue. The ancients still approached, though, and they would probably be a pain to deal with. Especially if they were healing the infected crewmen. The ones currently attacking him were relentless, though not especially tough. At least all of the ice around him would slow or otherwise impede the attackers, though.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
The juggernaut charged right past him as he barely dodged in time. The wall the juggernaut ran into crumpled from the force, and the Infested beast was stunned for a split second. Once it had recovered, it turned around and attempted to find Kapak, determined to finish off the Nidus. It seemed quite unaware of the regeneration Kapak had, and just wanted to destroy the Warframe.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
He would barely be able to stop the Valkyr, as it continued the relentless attack. Every parried attack would just be countered again with another slash. Any attacks from the Redeemer did next to nothing against the enraged Valkyr, and really only served to make them angrier. In that moment Svytoj had grabbed the spine and tried to stab the Valkyr with it, they instantly responded by using the other clawed hand that had <em>not</em> been batted away to swing toward the hand with the spike. Immediately following the parry, the Valkyr ducked down and slashed up in an attack that could possibly decapitate a Warframe.</span>

Easier said than done, of course. Even with the assistance of his effigy, there were still quite a few infested to chop though before he could even reach the slowly lumbering ancients. He hoped Svy and Doc had things under control, as he couldn&#39;t spare a moment to glance back.

The Frost dodge just a bit too late. The Valkyr&#39;s claw tore through the face plate of the Frost&#39;s Helmet, sending shards of metal flying everywhere. 
But it was just the opportunity that Svytoj felt he needed. With the spike still in hand, he rammed the point directly into the elbow of the raging Valkyr, aiming directly for the gap in the  joint.</span>

More still ran up to him in an attempt to tear the Frost to pieces. He was making a dent in them, though. Unfortunately, though, it would seem his time might be up on those ancients. One of the ancients finally got close enough to him to latch on with a tendril. With the sheer amount of Infested surrounding him, dodging would be next to impossible. Unless he figured something out, he would be dragged toward the three ancients and left vulnerable.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
The moment Kapak latched onto the juggernaut, it started flailing around, smashing into walls, and doing whatever it could to remove the Tenno. Whether it would work or not... Well, the juggernaut could only do so much from here. And judging by the trail of blood behind it as it charged around the room, that shot from Kapak&#39;s shotgun earlier had done <em>some</em> damage.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The hand that had tore away some of the helmet came back down for a second attempt to decapitate the Frost, just for the spike to get driven through the Valkyr&#39;s elbow. The technocyte and the armor did little to stop it, and it stabbed through completely. The Valkyr shrieked and stumbled backward, grasping the wound with their other hand. The claws were gone, at least for a moment, as they recoiled from the injury.</span>

He had managed to chop down a few of the Infested as he was dragged, but... Alas, he could not kill them all. Well, that, and there was the fact that some of them now crawling after him. A loss of limbs did little to deter them, with the horde now kicking at Leveret as he was dragged toward the three ancients. Already, he could notice the air was becoming less and less hospitable. Yes, one of them was a toxic ancient. That was quite unfortunate. While his effigy did a good job stopping most of the horde, there were still some that barged through and attempted to attack him. Seems like nothing was going his way.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
The enraged screams became pained screams at that moment. Having one&#39;s skin peeled away was quite painful, and this carapace was essentially this thing&#39;s skin. The flailing continued, and the juggernaut did whatever it could to remove Kapak. Granted, there wasn&#39;t much, but it tried. Luckily, it would seem the spines had not grown back quite yet. So, the beast was defenseless from here. All was going well, here&#39;s hoping Kapak noticed the tendril behind him, belonging to one of the ancients, whipping out to wrap around his neck. It turns out, in the struggle, the juggernaut had gotten closer to where Leveret was.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
Both luckily and unluckily, the Valkyr had made use of a ripline with their good arm to get some distance from Svytoj. This wasn&#39;t a retreat, though. Not yet. The pained and probably angry screams died down for a moment, as the Valkyr wrapped their good hand around the impaled arm, around the elbow. With a single pull, the damaged arm off of their body just above the elbow in a sickening <em>crunch</em>, leaving behind a bit of arm below the shoulder, dripping with blood. Holding the disembodied arm in its hand, the Valkyr plunged it into a nearby Infested growth. If Svytoj looked closely, he might see the metallic material of the spine... spreading across the disembodied arm?</span>

The ancient moved forward a bit, and almost seemed to stumble when Kapak pulled. That moment gave Kapak a chance to bury his spiky foot in the ancient, or at least it would if he&#39;s able to dodge another tendril from the third ancient. That was going to make things a bit more difficult, especially seeing as Kapak was midair. This third one was trying to latch onto one of his arms, in an obvious attempt to prevent escape.

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
As the tendril on his leg was beginning to finally weaken after multiple strikes from the axe, several more came out of the ancient&#39;s arm and all wrapped themselves around the entire lower leg. This wasn&#39;t just an attempt to knock Leveret over, this was an actual try to capture him. Or his frame, at least.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The Valkyr was now holding this metallic, disembodied arm in their right hand. Pulling it from the growth, the Valkyr sort of pointed it toward Svytoj. With another ear-splitting screech, the claws of void energy were back in her hand. Now being dug into the disembodied arm, it would seem the energy was directly being channeled into this improvised weapon, and the claws on the metal arm were back once again. With that, the Valkyr leaped at Svytoj, swinging this... arm... mace... thing? It was unusual, to say the least.</span>

Kapak&#39;s arm was caught by the other ancient, yanking him abruptly from the air. He slammed onto the ground, but quickly recovered by biting and gnawing his way out of the tangles of Infested tendrils that had imprisoned him.
&quot;Enough, you outdated fleshbags!&quot; Kapak howled as his Hirudo&#39;s spikes emerged from his forearms, &quot;I will-&quot;
Kapak stopped mid sentence as the room glowed orange, the metal remains and glossy Infested flesh reflecting the fire of Leveret&#39;s Ignis.
He fell onto the ground and began to crawl away from the orange glow, his breathing suddenly rapid and shallow.

The Frost waited, taking a crouching stance as the Valkyr dashed towards him; It only too a few seconds to close the gap.
The claws were mere feet away when Svytoj deployed his globe, and the fifteen foot area around him slowed.
The claw had begun to scrape away at the newly reformed armor.
Svytoj pulled back, claw marks marring  his newly repaired eye, and then he lunged; wrapping one arm around the Valkyr&#39;s, and his free hand around the warframe&#39;s throat.

And the Frost ran, barreling toward and through Leverate&#39;s flames, Infested Valkyr in tow.</span>

The ancient shrieked and stumbled back, and released its hold on the Chroma. The flames eating away at the face of the creature, it quite desperately tried to put itself out. It didn&#39;t seem to be effective, though, as it fell onto its back and continued shrieking. It flailed around on the ground, now basically helpless. However, Leveret had no chance to rest, though, as the horde of Infested rushed at him once again and tried to tear the Chroma to shreds.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
Well, he wasn&#39;t resisting, which certainly didn&#39;t help him at all. The ancient whose tendril had been bitten off didn&#39;t try to grab on again, stumbling back as what was left of the tendril was pulled back in that moment. However, the one still latched onto Kapak lifted him up off of the ground, wrapping a limb around his throat.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The Valkyr fell right into this trap, and it was caught off-guard by the sudden ice. It tried to break free and likely stab Svytoj, but was unable to do so as the two of them moved toward Leveret. Right as they reached the flames from the Ignis, the Valkyr suddenly struggled again as they shrieked in pain, not unlike the ancient had done. However, the third ancient who had been bitten by Kapak saw an opening, and a tendril lashed out to wrap around the Frost&#39;s throat.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
The two Corpus had been sitting in silence throughout all of this. Efahz had been seeming pretty restless, but Adrova was fairly happy to just sit there. Nothing notable had really happened. Adrova was still healthy, if a bit clueless. However, though, that wasn&#39;t going to last forever. Four objects entering scanner range. There was a small Corpus troop character, repainted in Perrin colors. Besides that, three archwings flew around it, in a sort of formation. They had come out of nowhere, and were flying toward the Orbiter worryingly quickly.</span>

&quot;No... please...&quot; Kapak whimpered as the tendril dragged him back towards the Ancient and into the air. The tendril was unsuccessful in strangling him due to the alveoli that covered nearly his entire body,  but that wasn&#39;t a problem, since Kapak was still incapacitated by his fear of fire.

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-MASTER? MASTER, YOU...</div>
Helminth&#39;s voice stopped, realizing that Kapak would be unable to offer any advice or commands.

The tendrils tightened around him, quite effectively gripping him as he panicked here. Not like he could have a chance to get his bearings again, either, seeing as there was still plenty of fire present. The downed ancient, the Valkyr...

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong> 
Well, hitting it with a Warframe was one way to do it. Unfortunately, it backfired a bit. The ancient still held onto him, as it was knocked back by the Valkyr. Svytoj would likely be dragged along with it, as it tried to get upright again. In this brief window, the Valkyr was starting to get back up.

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
It seemed no matter how many he burn through, more and more would charge in to replace them. Like before, it became difficult to tell when he was firing at an Infested creature actively attacking him, or a dead body merely being pushed toward him by the horde, like a shield. It was less like a horde, actually, and something more like a tidal wave.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
The three archwings and the transport ship pursued the Orbiter, accelerating as it began to retreat into the debris field. None of them opened fire next, but all four vehicles were moving quite fast. Right around then, Helminth would receive a message, originating from the center of the cluster of ships.</span>

Suddenly the flames from his ignis sputtered out. The canister was empty, and he didn&#39;t have time to swap it. He exchanged the gun for his shield once again, trying to use it to push away the horde of infested. Soon one leg buckled under the weight of the horde and he found himself on one knee, pushing with all his might against the impacts on his shield.

If all else failed, Kinsey knew they could try to dump their frame and make a break for it, so he kept that little bit of hope and prayed his dwindling energy would be enough to continue protecting his allies.</span>

&quot;Happy birthday, fathermucker!&quot; Kapak lashed out, forcing his hands through the flesh of the Ancient, reaching within its corroded, twisted flesh. He snagged a ball of its internal organs and ripped his hand out, attempting to pull the line of guts out through the wound he had made while jumping backwards off of the creature.

It was almost defenseless with all of its tendrils focused on restraining him, and had nothing much to fight back with when Kapak grabbed and removed its internal organs. With a last shriek and a gurgle, the Ancient let go and crumpled into a pile of Technocyte on the floor.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The plan worked... for a second. When he pulled the tendril, the Valkyr managed to lash out with a claw and slice through it, freeing itself and the third Ancient. While there was a pit of a pained groan from the Ancient, the Valkyr nearly immediately recovered and slashed at Svytoj again with the disembodied hand.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
The four spacecraft continued to accelerate, closing the gap more and more. Meanwhile, after a few moments of interference, the transmission finally came through.
&quot;<em>I&#39;m sorry...</em>&quot; The voice on the other hand was quiet, and had sounded synthesized. It actually sounded like a Cephalon, in fact. In fact, after the transmission reached Helminth, the Infested Cephalon would notice an attempt at an intrusion into the system. Also from a Cephalon. Something was trying to break into the ship&#39;s systems.</span>

The Frost was free; the Valkyr&#39;s talon cutting the binds attaching his neck to the ancient.  It was the first time Svytoj had a chance to see the battle field for what it was. As the Valkyr lunged, Svytoj rolled, Just avoiding being gutted by the claws. As he rolled to his feet again, He let out a wave of sharp, jagged, spikes of ice. But it wasn&#39;t towards the Valkyr; the wave was set to plunge directly into the swarm that had besieged Leveret.</span>

Kapak flicked his hands, tossing the innards of the Ancient aside before licking the blood and amber fluids of the Infested creature off.
He glanced down the hallway that the Juggernaut had carried him down, eying his equipment and old guts lying on the floor.
&quot;Hey where the Void did the Juggernaut go?&quot; Kapak yelled on the comms as he dashed towards his equipment, &quot;you know- the bigass fathermucking armoured monster?&quot;

<u>⇝Helminth</u>
With cold calculation, inhuman in every way, Helminth flooded the invading Cephalon&#39;s data connection with packets of corrupted data, meaningless large chunks of data in an attempt to overload the link and force the opposition to disconnect.
At the same time, the thrusters of the Orbiter turned off as the retro rockets at the nose of the ship blasted at full power. The massive Tenno craft lurched to a stop before accelerating at an alarming rate right back at its pursuers.

The ground shook, as it dropped from the ceiling once again and let out an almost painful high-pitched screech. In the confusion, it had managed to escape earlier, and seemed to be back with a vengeance. Specifically for...~

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
As the Ancient fell to the ground in front of him, he was immediately charged by the massive beast. It was angry now, and was at least intelligent enough to know that Kapak was the one that had harmed it. It was faster now, likely just out of sheer rage. He would have time to dodge, but could he take this thing in a fight?

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The wave of ice managed to knock back several of the horde and impale many, so that was good. However, in the time it took him to do this, the Valkyr was already running toward him again. It closed the last couple feet with a massive overhand slash, that looked quite deadly...

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
He would find the spot to his left to be free of Infested, as the ice crashed through there and took out a lot of the enemies bludgeoning him. The others tried to close this gap in their circle, but he had a brief window to take advantage of this weak point in the horde.

Something drove the Cephalon to maintain the connection. It did its best to counter, able to offer at least a little bit of resistance. If a Cephalon could whimper in pain, that&#39;s what this one would be doing. As it was overwhelmed, that first message was repeated. &quot;<em>I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry...</em>&quot;

Meanwhile, the pursuers split the moment the Orbiter turned around and changed course toward them. The dropship was a bit slow, but the sudden perpendicular change in direction it made was enough to keep it unscathed. It might have been slow, but the archwings weren&#39;t. The Orbiter would find itself being pelted by fire from the heavy guns the yet-unidentified pilots carried, and it was pursued by a swarm of drones from one of them. Looked like at least one was an Itzal, then.

With Tenno finesse, Kapak rolled forward, snatching up his Tigris and ammunition from the piles of gore he had left behind. He immediately leapt to the side, digging a large, bony spike into the weakened metal walls, waiting for the beast to either charge past him or charge into the wall beneath him.

<u>⇝Helminth:</u>
The interior of the ship blared with alarms as the Orbiter continued to maneuver through the debris backwards, attempting to lose the unfortunately much more deft Archwing-bound entities.
Helminth grew irritated at the invading Cephalon, and began to push back into the Cephalon&#39;s mind. Helminth&#39;s chaotic choir of voices slashed through the digital space, dangerously ravaging the Cephalon&#39;s mind in an attempt to drive it insane.
All the while, the Infested mind attempted once again to contact its master.

Holding down the trigger of the ignis, Leveret sprayed flames over the infested as he tried to scoot himself out of the center of the horde.

One of the many clawing creatures yanked on his leg in such a way that he felt something in his ankle give. Kicking the offending runner off with his other foot, he continued pushing himself backwards, hoping to find a wall and not more creatures.</span>

Though, the clattering reentrance of the Juggernaut did remind him of something.
He dashed backwards from the Valkyr, and Let out a blast from his redeemer, the pellets skidding towards the behemoth now baring down on Kapak.</span>

The juggernaut saw its target suddenly leap to the side, and immediately attempted to continue its pursuit. Right before it hit the wall, it suddenly changed direction and started to redirect itself, right as it smashed into the wall it was charging while still sideways. Barely pausing, it used the sudden deceleration to quickly recover and charge toward Kapak&#39;s new position. It was on a direct course to the wall he was attached to, likely trying to knock him off of it somehow.

<strong>LEVERET</strong>
Well, it would seem one or more of them saw an opportunity when one managed to grab onto him. The flames caused some to back away, but many still leaped toward him. One even attempted to jump onto the ignis itself, clearly sacrificing itself to stop Leveret from fighting back. He might be able to get out of this, but it wouldn&#39;t be easy.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The blast from the Redeemer struck the juggernaut&#39;s armor as it smashed into the first wall, making a little dent in the metallic hide as it recovered and charged again. Not much of an effect, really. The Valkyr, however, was still not about to give up. He suddenly found a ripline hooked onto his Redeemer, as the Valkyr tried to tear it from his hand while simaltaneously launching itself forward

Inside, the two Corpus knew something was wrong. While Adrova stumbled around in confusion, Efahz had his gun out and was pushing the bed Adrova had been laying in toward the door to use as cover, should anyone get in. Meanwhile, the Cephalon that had been trying to intrude was trying to sever the connection to the Orbiter while it repeated its apology with increasing desperation. Unfortunately, though, it was too overwhelmed to even do that.

Outside, the assault continued. The three Archwings began targetting the engines of the Orbiter, it now being barraged by weapon fire, attacks from the Itzal&#39;s drones, and missiles from an Odonata Archwing. The dropships kept its distance now, more just trailing behind the combat.

The creatures waved at the two Corpus and awkwardly stumbled over to them. Upon nearing, the Corpus would be able to see that the Infested apes bore weapons- together, two of them hoisted a Hema, while the fat one who had been staying in the chamber with them produced a Tysis from the chrysalis it had been &quot;gardening&quot;.

Leveret wasn&#39;t sure how much longer he could resist all this without getting infected himself. He didn&#39;t have a choice anymore. He had to dump his frame.

With a yell of frustration, the chroma went limp and Kinsey leapt free, dashing out of the heap of infestation and leaving a trail of flames behind them.

Svytoj quick jerked his weapon around, using it as an anchor to wrap the rip-line around his hand. His eye darted around the room, looking for another set of juggernaut spines. He opted for the more obvious target. As the Valkyr grew closer, Svytoj tightened his grip, and began to spin. With the infested Warframe mere inches away, he cut the line, sending it hurtling toward the Juggernaut, and hopefully, directly into the path of one of its spine strikes.</span>

The beast leaped up, attempting to knock Kapak off-balance with an impact from its armored carapace. The parts Kapak had tried to tear off had healed up, looking even more reinforced than before. The massive metallic shell of the juggernaut was on a direct collision course with Kapak, right as he saw several spines begin to protrude from it again...

<strong>LEVERET/KINSEY</strong>
The horde clearly thought they had won the moment the Chroma went limp, as they kept trying to tear it apart. None noticed at first when the Operator escaped, until several were engulfed in flames. Those ones shrieked in painnas they fell to the ground, and most others backed up. It was at this point that a few of them took notice of Kinsey, breaking off from the horde to chase the Operator.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
Against all odds, almost every step of his plan worked. The Valkyr was flung off toward the midair Juggernaut, helpless for a moment as it tried to regain some semblance of balance. Then, able to do so at a bit of an odd angle due to the disembodied arm they held, they fired another ripline at a nearby wall, and swung around to latch onto it. It stared down at the Frost now for a moment, before bullet-jumping back to continue its relentless assault. It didn&#39;t seem even remotely close to giving up.

The three archwings swerved to dodge the fire from the Engineer. The Itzal disappeared from sight and sensors entirely for a splut second, before reappearing under the Orbiter and opening fire on the engines yet again. The Odonata activated its forward shield, flying &#39;up&#39; before firing a volley of missiles at the Engineer. Meanwhile, the third Archwing swerved back and forth quickly, firing at any part of the engines that looked critical.

The Cephalon wasn&#39;t putting up anything close to a fight as it was bombarded with information. Already, software was starting to get corrupted, as it tried and fail to sever the connection and escape Helminth. &quot;<em>Please... stop...</em>&quot; The Cephalon begged, in a voice that sounded weak, and close to tears.

Meanwhile, inside, Efahz checked that his gun was indeed loaded, silently nodding to the disembodied voice of Helminth. He didn&#39;t even flinch when he saw the Engineers, just giving them a thumbs-up. Adrova hid under his bed, peeking out from under it occasionally.

&quot;HAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!&quot; Kapak unleashed a violent roar, his mouth open wide as he used the Void to shift his Warframe&#39;s positioning.  He torpedoed at a slight angle into the Junggernaut, his body ignoring any spines that would offend him, sinking into his flesh or not.
Hopefully he would manage to slam into the bigger creature hard enough to force it towards Svytoj below.
At the same time, he dug his Tigris&#39; blemished, rusty fan-like head into the Juggernaut&#39;s flesh and pulled the trigger.

<u>⇝Helminth:</u>
The damage to the opposing Cephalon was done, for now. Helminth severed the connection to the attacker, halting the stream of data. Of course, the Cephalon would have to be cleansed to recover from the data that had infected it and was likely still active  within its code.
Outside in space, the Engineer was now nowhere to be seen- the missiles took it out incredibly quickly. A leg and the fleshy remains of one of the Toxocysts were all that remained as proof of the creature&#39;s existence.
As the ship&#39;s engines were assaulted, fleshy tendrils escaped from the largest of holes in the armour. The vein-like growths were quick to cover the holes, calcifying rather quickly into a bone-like armour in a makeshift reparation of the ship&#39;s damage.</span>

As more and more broke off to go after the Tenno, the corpses of the others bombarded with void energy proved to be a liability. They began tripping over one another after a while, but they still gained more and more ground as they charged Kinsey. Did some dead Infested really matter, when the rest were still ready to fight? He was right, though. This plan wouldn&#39;t be sustainable. Even with the very sizable dents he had made, the horde was still massive.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The Valkyr, evaded yet again, dug a few claws into the metal floor to slow themself down. After leaving this massive gash in the floor, the Valkyr saw him moving toward the Juggernaut, and let out one of those awful screeches again. In a last-ditch effort to keep him isolated from the group, one more ripline was thrown out toward his ankle, intended to wrap around it.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
Somehow, he did manage to push the juggernaut back toward the ground. While the shotgun blast itself was partially stopped by the incredibly tough armor of the juggernaut, the blade was able to dig into hit. The tigris did hurt, if nothing else. Better than nothing. Feeling an enemy on its back, though... In a sort of confused panic, it suddenly launched each and every one of the spines at once. Some went around Kapak, some went through, but a lot of the ones already embedded in him ended up launching him back with them. Unless he managed to do something, he would soon likely find himself impaled to a wall.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
Hull damage wasn&#39;t the initial concern. Just slowing this ship down. With the engines damaged, though... All three Archwings regrouped, moving to the &#39;top&#39; of the Orbiter. Focusing on a small part of the hull, all three opened fire with every bit of destructive power at their disposal. Any tendrils that attempted to cover it up were shot at too, as they likely tried to keep whatever hull breach they could create open. Throughout all of this, the dropship was starting to close in on the Orbiter again...</span>

Kapak was strong, but physics dictated that he follow the flight path of the spines embedded in his torso. With a cry, Kapak scooted across the room&#39;s air, and was promptly impaled, pinned to the opposing wall.
&quot;Well! This is bad!&quot; Kapak groaned and shuffled, wiggling to try and escape the spiky prison he was confined to. His flesh began to shift, moving like liquid, or perhaps more accurately a bowl of excited worms. Slowly but surely, gravity worked for him, pulling the Nidus forward and off from the spines. He&#39;d be free in a few seconds!

Helminth&#39;s emotionless, bizarre voice called out to Kapak over the comms.

<u>Kapak:</u>
&quot;Yeah well, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s much I can do about it right now, is there, huh?!&quot; Kapak snapped at his Cephalon.
&quot;What do you want me to do, the thing you don&#39;t like me doing?&quot;

<u>⇝Helminth:</u>
<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-A LARGE PART OF US THINKS THAT IS- B- AD IDEA- *crackle*</div>
Helminth&#39;s transmission cut out for a moment as an explosion wracked the ship, the intruders bursting their way through the hull.

&quot;Shut your squishy digital orifice! Just try to deal with them best you can, and uh, maybe while you still can, shoot me my Archwing?&quot;

~The Engineers wiggling in anticipation did their best not to bump or even touch Efahz and Adrova. They waved their weapons clumsily, but eagerly. There was a thudding sound as the airlock to the Somatic Link was locked, only able to be overridden by Helminth at this point.~</span>

In the corner of Leverets HUD, a small way point tag suddenly burst to life, marking the location of Svytoj’s Soma prime.
“Dash over to that spot and get to cover! That’s the best I can do for yah!” Svytoj yelled to Kinsey mid leap. Just in time for the Valkyr’s rip-line to dig into his calf. The Frost landed flat on his stomach, clutching at anything he could to keep himself from being dragged back. He looked back at the Valkyr, then over to Kapak. He let go of his hand hold, redeemer clutched tight, and swung at his calf. The rip cord came loose, along with the flesh it was attached to.
He didn’t have enough time to scream. Svytoj lifted himself on his good leg, and leaped towards he pinned Nidus, and the spines that held him there.</span>

The horde may have stumbled over their own numbers from time to time,  but there was almost nothing stopping them all as they ran toward their singular target, this lone Operator. They didn&#39;t care about anything else nearby. They were all locked in on Kinsey.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
At the cost of his calf, this plan sort of worked and he was able to seperate himself from the Valkyr. Having failed to account for such a... self-destructive tactic, the Valkyr stumbled a bit as it tried to regain some balance. The ripline only returning the chunk of flesh from the Frost, the infested Frame merely tossed it aside as it growled.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
The Juggernaut&#39;s spines stayed there against the wall, buried several inches into the steel plating. The Juggernaut itself was struggling as all of those injuries seemed to catch up to it. Blood trickled down the almost metallic hide, dripping onto the floor as it glared at Kapak. And then, roaring, it tried charging yet again at close range.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
The dropship sped up a bit more, closing in. The doors on the side opened up, revealing several troops all wearing the uniforms of Perrin Sequence operatives. Prepped for zero-G, of course. Even a few MOAs hung from the sides of the ship. As the three archwings broke off a bit, all of the Perrin operatives dove down through a bit of zero-G and into the dropship, readying Dera rifles the moment they were in the Orbiter. They were followed by the MOAs, as the dropship backed off again.</span>

The tenno squinted slightly as they focused their attention on their HUD - most likely transferred through one of the implants connected near their right eye. They found the spot Svy had indicated and quickly void-dashed to it, leaving a trail of bright orange flames blazing behind them.

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough!&quot; As Kapak slid from the spines, he sprinted forward and leaped, aiming to land on the Juggernaut&#39;s back once again. The Nidus left a trail of blood which quickly dissipated as his wounds closed.

As the Perrin Sequence operatives landed within the dark, dank Orbiter, they were greeted with Helminth&#39;s glaring, cold, holographic crimson eye.

This retreat had actually bought the Operator a few precious moments, before the Infested had a chance to refocus on Kinsey again. It seemed to finally be noticeably shrinking, especially as a fair amount stumbled into the fire left behind by the Operator. There were still many of the twisted Corpus left, but... fewer. Even fewer, with every shot fired toward them. 

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
The Juggernaut, certainly lacking a fair bit in intelligence, easily fell for Kapak&#39;s plan as it charged. It kept on ramming even after the Nidus jumped up, crashing into the wall as Kapak would be able to successfully land. The beast went back to thrashing around, likely uselessly trying to shake the Tenno off of its back. It roared, as it twisted and bumped into walls. It didn&#39;t like this, that was for sure.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
There was a quiet, low growl from the Valkyr. It gripped its own disembodied arm even tighter, staring back up at the Frost. Everything was sort of silent for a moment, before the wounded infested Valkyr charged forward recklessly with the singular goal of finishing off Svytoj. They leaped up toward the wall, attempting to slash directly down as soon as Svytoj was within range.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
Orders and statuses were whispered back and forth among the operatives for a moment, as they all kept their rifles raised and aimed at the fleshy interior of the ship. The moment the eye appeared, almost all of them diverted their attention for a split second toward it. The body language of some seemed to change to something far more worried with the vague threat from the Cephalon, but the frightened ones were interrupted by orders from others. A moment later, the operatives, accompanied by their MOAs, split up into groups to go each direction. One heading toward the front of the ship, the other heading back in the general direction of the Transference chamber.</span>

Kinsey seemed to have regained some confidence from the damage the flames were doing. Even as the trail of fire dissipated, they followed it up with another volley of blasts from their amp. Maybe, just maybe, they could keep this going for a little while longer?

&quot;How we doin&#39; over there boys? Everyone still alive?&quot; they asked between shots, not being able to look away from the horde for long enough to actually check on either Svy or Kapak.</span>

Kapak once again went for the Juggernaut&#39;s dorsal plating, invoking his strength once again to pry the monster open like a crab.
&quot;OH, DOING JUST DANDY!&quot; Kapak called out in response to Leveret as he pulled with all his might.

~Within Kapak&#39;s Orbiter, the air itself seemed to grow restless. Gurgling and sloshing emanated throughout the ship&#39;s walls, lights flickering and casting the twisted shadows of the Infestation upon walls.
The group headed towards the ship&#39;s bow was attacked almost instantly, and incredibly violently as three Helminth Chargers appeared to leap from the dark. Or at least, it looked like three. One of the two Helminth chargers had two heads, its hydra-like appearance allowing it to snarl and bite twice as much as its other. The creatures growled fearsomely, tackling the closest of members of the party. At the same time, a claw-like appendage tore itself free from a bundle of flesh residing on the ceiling, falling downwards into the group like a scythe.
The group headed towards the Somatic Link would encounter nothing yet.~</span>

He still clung to the wall, quill clenched tightly in his hand; watching the Valkyr ascend towards him. As they raised their severed claw, Svytoj dove. As he fell, he pointed the tip of the quill directly at the Valkyr’s head, using his combined speed and weight to drive it into the warframe’s skull, and hopefully avoid the claws overhead.</span>

The horde was running out of bodies, but the Operator seemed to be running out of space. Kinsey was quickly getting backed into a wall, as the Infested closed in. Sure, their numbers were seriously dwindling, but they seemed intent on surrounding the Operator. Not like there weren&#39;t options for an escape, but they seemed to have some vague semblance of a plan. Odd, really... Quite odd.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
Weakened by the rather long battle, even something as powerful as the juggernaut found itself exhausted. It kept thrashing about, but it seemed to be getting sluggish. The pain of having plates peeled away hardly helped, as it roared in pain. Spines already shot out, it had nothing to defend its back. Not even any of the ancients, or the Valkyr, or the horde pursuing Kinsey.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
No tactics. Just a head-on charge. The Valkyr soared through the air for a moment, already about to swing down with the disembodied arm, before... The spine hit its mark. Not even a shout from the Valkyr. More of a pained or surprised gasp, as the spine split apart any armor plating in its way. A moment later, the Infested frame went entirely limp, right in time for the two of them to hit the ground. The disembodied arm rolled out of its hand, as the glowing void claws disappeared.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
It was chaos, within moments.  The operatives and proxies fired on the chargers, as the tackled ones were forced to the ground. At point-blank, it was hard to miss, but some panicked and fired several very poorly-aimed shots that probably just hit some walls. And while some may have hit the chargers, the operatives the creatures attacked would also get shot. A lot. Mostly by accident. That claw was another issue altogether, and a couple more operatives found themselves decapitated before anyone knew what was happening. The group bound for the Link heard the panicked cries and gunfire, but instead of turning back, just advanced toward their objective even quicker.</span>

The tenno released several void blasts at the growing heap of infestation in the hopes that the force would push them back. They tried to avoid touching the infestation - who knows what it would do to them - but it was getting pretty difficult.

“The rifle, Kid! Use the Rifle!!” He called out. Svytoj leveled his sidearms at the infested, and opened fire, being sure to keep Kinsey out of the crossfire.</span>

Kapak roared in triumph as the armour of the monster was torn away. With the Juggernaut&#39;s twisted, mutated innards exposed, the Nidus flew into a frenzy. Slowly, at first, but soon speeding up to an alarming rate, Kapak tore out organ after organ, muscle after muscle, bone after bone. The Juggernaut&#39;s arteries sprayed blood, bathing the Warframe in its juices. Kapak paused every so often to shovel a handful of the beast&#39;s flesh into his maw, furthering fueling his furor.

~Aboard Kapak&#39;s ship, the chaos within the Landing Craft segment died down. Soon enough, the assailants had put down the remaining intruders, their bodies leaking blood from their weapons.~

One lunged at the operator, but promptly found itself burnt to a crisp by void energy. Then another lunged. And another. They were really starting to close in, now. Their numbers had really thinned, but Kinsey was still outnumbered around 30 to 1. Good thing they were near that gun, right? Seeing how quickly they advanced now, Kinsey would likely have to do <em>something</em>.

<strong>KAPAK</strong>
As the Nidus began burrowing into it, the Juggernaut could only screech in pain as it lost blood an organs alike. Beyond the armor plating, the soft internal organs and muscles were easy to tear apart. It didn&#39;t take long for something vital to get hit, and the beast to let out one last shriek and a weak, futile struggle. With that, it collapsed, its metal flesh hitting the floor. No more breathing or muscle twitches. It certainly looked dead, that was for sure.

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
The body of the Valkyr stayed very much dead, especially with the impaled head separated from its warped, mutilated body. Between that and the Juggernaut, that really just left what remained of the horde chasing down Kinsey. This wasn&#39;t over yet, but it was close.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
Nothing left but a bunch of dead Perrin operatives toward the front of the ship. As the other group approached the chamber, Efahz visibly tensed up and pushed Adrova down behind cover. The sound of the MOAs in particular neared, as they rounded the corner. The door was in sight, for the operatives.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not reasoning with them. They work for Clogori, they deserve it.&quot; Efahz mumbled, holding his gun even tighter. He sounded impatient, annoyed, sort of angry... He wasn&#39;t in anything even close to what <em>might</em> be a good mood. &quot;Safer to kill them, anyway...&quot;</span>

&quot;Well, that&#39;s over,&quot; Kapak said, blood and other fluids from the monster&#39;s insides dripping from his frame. &quot;Now, Lebanon, I uh, got some... maybe bad news?

The eye blinked before disappearing. There was a clunking sound as a deadbolt locked the airlock tight.

Soon enough, a swarm of 3 Djinn Sentinels whirred to life from Kapak&#39;s Arsenal, quickly floating down the hallway and into the group of invading operatives. The Sentinels unleashed a barrage of poisonous darts- likely sharp enough to pierce jumpsuits, but not tough enough to strike through metal. Each dart, if successfully landed, would deliver a nonlethal but <em>extremely</em> painful neurotoxin- only the most strong of mind would be able to resist its crippling effects.

At the same time, a flood of maggots dropped from the ceiling, screeching hellishly as they attempted to nibble and gnaw flesh and metal alike!</span>

&quot;Actually, if you don&#39;t mind, I could use some assistance over here!&quot; they called, still frantically trying to fend off the infested. A strategic vertical void dash landed them on top of the pile of infested corpses with a poof of flame, but there were still plenty of &#39;live&#39; ones clambering towards them. One received a boot to whatever remained of its head, another a blast directly to the torso.

&quot;I had to dump my frame somewhere back-&quot; they paused their defensive barrage very briefly to motion to another pile of corpses, &quot;-there, ish, and they really went to town on it, so...yeah.

His aura finally kicked back in, the missing flesh of his leg beginning to close back up. The Frost continued to hobble towards the mass of infested between him and Kinsey&#39;s warframe, sending torrents of grakata fire into the hoard. 
And that&#39;s when he heard Kapak&#39;s question.
&quot;Go take care of it, Doc. I&#39;ve got this .&quot; Came over the COMMs, Svytoj marching ever closer to the spot where Leveret fell. He continued his onslaught against the infested, scanning for the downed Chroma.</span>

Kinsey squinted slightly, searching for where their frame was marked on their HUD. They could see the outline of the busted up Chroma lying on the ground, and marked it for Svy on his HUD as well.</span>

Between the flames, the further blasts of void energy, and the grakatas, the horde was reduced to a few stragglers within moments. Soon, those ones collapsed as well. Many burned in the void energy Kinsey left behind, leaving the smell of burning flesh in the air. A few struggled and grunted as they tried to pull themselves back to their feet, but they too gave in eventually. With that, everything was neutralized. The bodies of the Valkyr and the Juggernaut were both still, blood pooling on the floor around each.

Bodies of Infested were strewn around, all sorts of injuries damaging their bodies some way or another. Filled with bullets, sliced apart earlier during Leveret&#39;s struggle, burnt to a crisp... The damage to the room was pretty severe, but it was hardly pristine in the first place.

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
The MOAs had taken the front, which soon proved to be a good thing for the operatives. Bad for Helminth, of course. A few darts got through here and there, but most met the armor of the proxies. The Sentinels were met with a barrage of lasers in response. Probably enough to do damage, if not outright destroy them from the concentrated fire. Of course, none of them saw the maggots coming.  Some of that gunfire was directed <em>up</em>, now. A few operatives shouted or even screamed in panic, as the maggots dug through their environmental suits. Soon, many had resorted to prying the maggots off and stomping or otherwise crushing them. An few unlucky few had their suits breached, resulting in some suffocating.</span>

Kapak pulled out a maggot from the folds of his flesh, tossing it underhand at the pile of bodies that had been slain, where it would explode like a slimy grenade, ensuring furthermore that the assailants were neutralized for good.
There was a faint rattling in the distance as Kapak&#39;s archwing burrowed its way through the ship, attempting to find the fastest route to the Warframe.</span>

With the rest of the infested cleared out, Kinsey made their way towards their frame. It was pretty buried under all the infested corpses, but as soon as they shoved aside enough of them to see the white of their frame, they transferred back.

<strong>Leveret</strong>
Unfortunately, it took a moment for him to realize all the damage that had been done to his frame.
&quot;Alrighty, let&#39;s g- oh muck!&quot;
Leveret lurched to one side, leaning against a wall as he was instantly alerted to all of his injuries. He shifted his weight to one foot and pressed a hand into his side, where a noticeable amount of dimly glowing red-orange fluid was leaking. &quot;Voiddamn! Okay, yeah, now I remember why I dumped my frame earlier.&quot;

Indeed, his frame was covered in dents and scratches, and a couple of the stronger attacks had left open wounds on his torso and shoulder. Overall, he looked like shit, and it was slightly surprising he was still standing.</span>

The frost quickly hobbled over to Leveret, the hole in his leg not yet completely healed.
“Alright, kiddo, take. Breather.” He said, directing the Chroma to sit. Taking a moment to inspect the damage, Svytoj pulled out a medical kit, and alongside his aura, got to work patching his comrade’s wounds. 
“Doc, take care of your ship. Given what you did to the juggernaut over there, should only take you a couple minutes.” Svytoj said calmly.
“As for you” He said, turning his attention to Leveret “we may wanna consider pulling back; I wanna get my boy back, too. But if we ain’t smart about it, we may end up like him, or dead.”</span>

I&#39;ll be totally functional in like...two minutes tops.&quot;

&quot;Listen. Don&#39;t go back to your orbiter.

Kapak stroked his chin for a moment, not flinching at all as his archwing burst out of the doorway the group had entered from. The Nidus shot a glance at his Archwing, then back at Leveret. He walked slowly towards the Chroma, nudging Svytoj aside before sticking his fingertips inside the hole of one of the wounds.
&quot;Hmph.&quot; Kapak grunted as something inside of Leveret&#39;s Warframe lurched, &quot;Fine. We kill this asshole, but fast. I might not even have a home after this. Mucking gutheads might be bounty hunters... I would say if I lose my ship, I&#39;m going to snap your neck, but if I lose my ship.... I lose my life.&quot;
As Kapak&#39;s last words fell spitefully from his mouth, there was a jerk as Kapak pulled his fingers from Leveret&#39;s wounds. The wounds began to heal even quicker than before- looking closely, one might see the Infested flesh within the wounds shifting and lurching, sealing the lacerations from the inside, making the reparation job from Svytoj even easier.
&quot;Helminth, keep me posted on the situation.&quot; Kapak muttered under his breath as he turned and walked towards the door to the next area. As he did so, the Archwing folded itself up compactly once more and zipped back down the way it had come. &quot;If things start to get spicy, I might have to delink.&quot;</span>

Aboard the Orbiter, the onslaught of maggots continued, their small bodies aiding them in evading gunfire and the boots of the crewmen. The Sentinels, being rather delicate, were destroyed easily during the initial retaliation. Only one remained, taking advantage of the chaos to strafe about and continue peppering targets with its Stinger.
At this time, one of the Chargers from the front of the ship made it to the fray. The other one, collapsed from blood loss, lay in the middle of the upper deck. The one that made it was already dripping blood from all over thanks to the deceased intruders&#39; weapons. Without hesitation, it threw itself into the nearest Moa, taking hold of its leg with its mandible.</span>

As Frames were patched up and discussions were had, everything just sort of... shook, for a moment. The kind of shake from some heavy object being dropped somewhere off in the distance. There was no sort of follow-up, though. Just the shake, and everything went silent again. Just the breathing of the walls and the floors, as the growths all around them squirmed endlessly. Gross, but currently harmless. Heck, even the bodies seemed to be decaying already- Wait, that wasn&#39;t normal.

<strong>MEANWHILE, ON THE ORBITER</strong>
&quot;<em>DEPLOY TOXIN!</em>&quot;, shouted one of the several operatives. They were quickly being overwhelmed, so... this was really the time for extreme measures. As the MOA attacked by the charger found itself being torn apart, another operative reached for a grenade. Detonator set, hurled down the hall toward the closed door, five beeps, then... When this thing detonated, there wasn&#39;t the expected burst of plasma. No, instead, a mist of antiserum spread through the air quite rapidly, as the operatives and proxies continued shooting and stomping on maggots.</span>

The Chroma grunted and flinched slightly as Kapak shoved his fingers into one of the wounds. He couldn&#39;t help but grunt as his insides seemed to shift on their own. &quot;Ugh, that feels...weird...&quot;

Leveret grunted once more, again failing to ignore the unexpected jerking sensation. He clapped a still-bloody hand on the tall Nidus&#39; shoulder, discreetly running his other hand over the now-closing wound.
&quot;Doc, you saved Adrova&#39;s life. I owe you big time. I&#39;m not gonna just stand around and wait for them to blow up your ship. I wouldn&#39;t do this if I didn&#39;t expect to be able to go through with it.&quot;
After a moment, Leveret pushed both of the attending Tenno away and pushed off of the wall to stand on his own. His ankle still felt slightly off, but it didn&#39;t hurt to put weight on it anymore.
&quot;Alright, that&#39;s enough for now. Now scoot, both of you, we need to get m-&quot;

He glanced around. &quot;Uh...that sounded bad. Like, wreck collapse kind of bad. Watch your step further in.&quot;

With that, Leveret couldn&#39;t wait anymore, and started down the hall.</span>

That is, before his Warframe suddenly collapsed.
The deep pinkish pustules that poked through the Warframe’s bony armour flickered out for a moment, Kapak stumbling as it did.
“Voiddamnit... Helminth... hold it together...”
The Warframe wheezed, gripping at a phantom pain in its chest.

~The Orbiter went into chaos as the infesticidal fog spread throughout the air. The flesh caking the walls, floor and ceiling detached, flailing about wildly, fluids leaking from orifices and blood beginning to pour from lesions beginning to form in response to the cleansing miasma.
Maggots within the gas froze, their nerves paralyzed and the membranes on their skin bursting, causing their innards to spill. The Helminth Charger gave a howl as it finished the Moa off, quickly retreating away from the scene as the antiserum billowed toward it.
Soon enough, there were no attackers left to oppose the invading operatives. The only danger was the flailing flesh, but it was too panicked to target the operatives specifically.~</span>

The Frost finally went to retrive his weapon from under the mass of dead infested.  He was about to follow Leveret down the hall when he saw Kapak go down.

Well, the hallway ahead was... more of the same. Standard Corpus design, just entirely covered with a whole variety of growths. It all seemed to be moving and squirming more and more the further they went into here, almost unsurprisingly. By now, it almost seemed to be trying to grab at Leveret as he advanced, To no avail, of course. Even here, the walls seemed to be... decomposing, dissolving, falling apart...

<strong>HELMINTH</strong>
Of course, the operatives wasted no time. Delving into the mist of toxin, a couple of laser cutters were taken out, and within moments, the intruders were trying to burn through the door. A slow process, but the. Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, Efahz was already tensed up, and ready to open fire at a moment&#39;s notice. He may have been ready, but... Adrova was cowering there behind the makeshift cover, shaking with fear and only barely holding on to his own weapon. Neither spoke a word, at this point.</span>

The Chroma hurried over to Kapak and Svytoj, a part of him suddenly hoping he hadn&#39;t made a very dire miscalculation.
&quot;Hey, talk to us, what&#39;s going on?&quot; He urged. <em>I didn&#39;t just sign his death warrant, did I?</em>

The logical part of Leveret&#39;s mind immediately jumped to strategizing. Could the nidus walk? Would they have to carry him, leave him behind? Was pushing forward with the mission even the right choice?

He quickly squashed those questions. He&#39;d do just fine. He always did.</span>

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; Kapak snapped, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about... it! Let&#39;s just... get this mucking... job done!&quot;
Kapak gave the surrounding area a quick look around, pointing at the fluidic flesh. &quot;Something off... with the chemical... environment for this strain, maybe?&quot; Kapak prodded the nearest protruding tumour with the butt of his shotgun.

~The laser cutters of the Operatives made steady progress, as the metal the airlock was made of was nowhere near as tough as the typical rubedo-infused steel found throughout the rest of a Tenno&#39;s ship. However, as the Operatives burned through the metal frame of the airlock, the door to Kapak&#39;s personal quarters opened, revealing a dim, dark interior. Whether or not the operatives would notice as they focused on the task at hand was another story.~

Well... not much happened, to be frank. Bodies kept burning away to a crisp, the regular squelching of the growths continued, the juggernaut and the Valkyr each continued to decompose...

The door opening caught their attention, of course. There was some confused murmuring from amongst the operatives, before a decision was made and two broke off to go check out this new room. With a MOA and an Osprey to back them up, of course. Flashlights on... they stepped into the dark room, as a couple of operatives continued to burn the rest of the way through the door. Any second now...

&quot;A... what?&quot; Efahz asked, a tad muffled now as he got the mask on. Adrova kept on adjusting his, really. Never fit quite right... Efahz raised an eyebrow, glancing back as the operatives got closer and closer to breaching. Gun clenched painfully tight, he glanced back and forth from the engineer to the door. &quot;Whatever, sure. If it&#39;ll help us. Just do it quick.&quot;</span>

&quot;Nothing!&quot; Kapak snarled, wrapping his grotesque grip around Svytoj&#39;s Warframe&#39;s forearm. He pushed it away, spittle flying and drool dripping from the Warframe&#39;s bared teeth as he cursed.

~Within the darkness of the room, the only sound in the Operative&#39;s ears would have been the soft squelching of Infested flora experiments Kapak had been placing on the vignettes and broken fishtanks of the room. Nearly no light from the stars shone in; the usually present, large window on the far side of the room  was coated in a thick layer of vine-like, pulsating Infested arteries. The Operatives&#39; lights revealed mountains of junk the Nidus had been storing- half-built Prime Weapons, stolen toolboxes and equipment from Grineer and Corpus alike, an old Loki Prime Warframe, bobblehead minifgures, large pieces of Sentient and Orokin wreckage obviously scavenged from Old War sites...
Something finally caught the eyes of one of the operatives, or it most likely did. It was difficult to miss; a blue glow in the corner of the room, its source obscured by the vignette in the center of the room. Whatever it was, the Operatives weren&#39;t able to see it...</span>

Well, this next corridor was... poorly lit, to say the least. Lights flickered all of the way down, and growths had covered most of the doors and what few lights still worked consistently. It seemed so much more full of life, here. Which was... not a good thing. The walls inhaled, exhaled, and seemed to move an awful lot. Both Leveret and Svytoj would be interrupted, though, as their comms were quite abruptly detecting something. Just like last time, it seemed to be coming from <em>right</em> at the center of the ship cluster. The strange part, though... It&#39;s on a frequency neither of their comms were set to moments before, and yet they were now. Well, they were close to it.

They had been about to investigate the junk here, or just flat-out leave the room again. That was, until that flash of light, and... whatever that was. There was no time to react, of course. Neither of the operatives had a chance to open fire, one of them just flat-out dropping his weapon and falling backward. The one being attacked, well... he was probably worse off, as he screamed and shielded his face. The MOA opened fire, but was <em>very</em> inaccurate at this range and accomplished little.

&quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; One of the operatives outside shouted, hearing the shouts and gunfire from the adjacent room. Seeing how much more pressing this whole thing got, the intruders rushed to breach the door to the Transference chamber. They were nearly done cutting through, but regardless, an explosive charge soon found itself attached to the door. It was fairly low-powered, of course. Anything bigger on a ship this size was a bad idea. The operatives and proxies backed away, as the timer ticked down. 5... 4.... 3... 2...

&quot;Is that your Carmine Hive-&quot; Efahz started, before being cut off as the charge detonated. He gasped, ducked down and avoiding bits of debris. Immediately, every gun the surviving intruders had was being fired into the Transference chamber, barraging everything with laser fire. Adrova cowered there, trying to shield himself even in spite of the cover. Efahz was blind-firing over the cover, really just trying to hit <em>anything</em> as the torrent of fire from the energy weapons continued.

Again, the Chroma slapped the base of his hand against his helmet a few times, wondering if something has come loose again. However, it didn&#39;t seem to help, so he held up a hand to motion for the group to be quiet, listening in as he pushed forward. In an unexpected moment of insight, he decided to message the other two with text instead of speaking.

The fleshier innards writhed, glowing a violent intense red,  and howling in pain.
The Engineers hiding next to Adrova and Efahz shrieked incoherently, gripping their weapons as saliva dripped from their mouths. Their faces darted around spasmodically, watching the bullets peppering the walls.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
The Nidus&#39; emissive boils flickered once again, his Warframe stumbling. He kept his balance, at least.
[MUCK. WEAPONS HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED IN MY TRANSFERENCE CHAMBER.]

~The mysterious assailant collided with the Operative shielding his face, the full force of the entity battering him aside and into the wall with what was likely a very loud bang. It hovered quickly now, travelling towards the Moa and knocking it to the floor with a bump.
In the combined light of the hallway and the other Operatives&#39; weapons, the mysterious nature of the attacking thing revealed: an armless Sentient Drone. It was missing both upper limbs, and was covered in scratch marks likely inflicted by Kapak&#39;s prodding and testing. Several parts of its body were also missing the bone-like metal plates that would have usually armoured it. Of course, now awoken, the Sentient began to regenerate its armour as it jammed its intact legs into the unbalanced Moa. It was attempting to assimilate the proxy!~</span>

Further along, the twisted and thoroughly infected corridors of the ship cluster continued on. But it was so much more grown over, here. Like nothing else on the ship. Everything was overgrown like some infested jungle, and maggots could be seen crawling along here and there. Nothing bigger, though. And the maggots hardly seemed dangerous, at this point.

<em><strong>MURDER SHIP OF MURDER AND DEATH</strong></em>
&quot;What is that thing!? Is that a Sentient?!&quot; An operative nearly screamed, turning his attention away from the transference chamber. Soon, the squad was starting to retreat, abandoning the MOA altogether. They held out hope they could somehow take out the Sentient, but... They were equipped for Infested. Not likely. As soon as it had started, the assault upon Efahz&#39;s position in the chamber had ended. No, the intruders had bigger priorities.

&quot;Hey, uh... I mean, if it works...&quot; Efahz mumbled, ducking down as far as he could go as he listened to the screams, the gunfire, the panicked beeps of the MOA... He listened, while Adrova cowered and waited it all out. The blue flashes still reflected off of the walls as the drone was bombarded with energy weapons, but at least nothing was <em>actively</em> trying to kill the two defectors.</span>

It looked... vaguely mutalist, the maggot. But, well, unsurprisingly, there were differences. Very clear mutations and changes. It squirmed in his grip, trying to slip out. But it seemed harmless enough, at this size. Not intent on attacking. The other maggots crawled along, to wherever they were supposed to be going. Wherever that was...

&quot;We&#39;re-... done here...&quot; Clogori said back to whoever else was there, rather abruptly. Rather suddenly, the communication cut out altogether. The channel went silent, even the static gone. Well, that was the end of that. As they continued on, they could finally see a light. Further down the corridor, there was a sort of... intermittent, orange flashing. What could that be?

<strong>ORBITER LADS</strong>
Another operative took the full brunt of the drone, and he was done in an instant. The others were in chaos, unable to really rationally make decisions. Open fire? Run? None could decide. The proxies stood their ground, but a couple of the fleeing soldiers were gunned down by the MOA. The remaining non-assimilated Proxies managed to get a few shots in, crippling the assimilated robot. However, that was hardly the end of their issues. Seeing his chance, Efahz leaped up over cover and ducked down in the doorway, checking his weapon juuuust one more time before he popped out and took a few shots of his own at the Perrin operatives.</span>

~The Sentient drone&#39;s usefulness dropped as it began to bang its head into the side of the wall repetitively, seemingly ignoring the Operatives- at least for now. It continued to emit an otherworldly hum accompanied by loud screeches and fog-horn like bellows, all mixed together in some unholy smoothie of sound.

The light kept flashing, and turned out to be a console displaying a glowing screen of text. And right there, next to it, a door partially grown over with fairly minimal amounts of the Infested growths. The console was waiting for user input, with little infested tumors having managed to grow here and there. Well, here it was. Some sort of a sign that something was here. Well, specifically, that Clogori&#39;s... something, was here. Even with how everything else was in disrepair, the door and the console were perfectly functional and mostly clean.

<strong>MEANWHILE, IN THE ORBITER</strong>
Efahz chose to press his advantage, assisted by the Engineers. The fleeing intruders took no notice to the Sentient&#39;s odd behavior, far too preoccupied with the absolute <em>fear</em> and the attack from the others. Even with how inaccurate they were, several more were still taken down by the Engineers. With Efahz, of course. The slaughter continued, and soon... only two managed to make it back around the corner, running back up toward the middle of the ship and desperately fleeing. Well, this situation deteriorated.</span>

~The Engineers cheered as the attackers retreated, making bubbly gurgles and clumsy dances around the two Corpus.

There were a few distressed beeps as the thoroughly damaged screen flickered. But, the door didn&#39;t open. What, did Kapak expect it to work miraculously? Just open up because it malfunctions? Anyway... Well, Leveret was in luck. Access hatch, right on the side of the monitor. Opening it up would be easy. Unfortunately, it&#39;d be a bit more difficult to open the door <em>itself</em>. The various wires were far more complex than anything Grineer. Well... Maybe it would still work?

<strong>ORBITER TIME</strong>
Adrova was only further confused, and he was still very much sticking to cover. He tried peeking out, but there wasn&#39;t much he could see from where he was. Efahz, meanwhile, was staying where he was. May as well let the Sentient deal with it. As the Sentient charged once more, the last two surviving intruders dove to the groud in some last-ditch effort to avoid it. And that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> accounting for the spectres.</span>

Once the remaining operatives were in sight, the specters dropped. In unison, the Saryn and Nova slammed down on the operatives shoulders, driving them to the floor.

The Frost reached his almost-too-big hand inside and felt around, trying to get a sense of what wire connected to what. Watching the screen for changes, he unplugged a semi-random wire and plugged it back in. &quot;At least Corpus stuff is less likely to just fall apart...&quot;</span>

Kapak took a step back to let Leveret work and scratched his neck.
“Err... usually that works,” the Nidus said, casting a sideways glance at Svytoj.

~The literal disarmed Battalyst seemed to ignore the Specters as they dropped in, flying upwards and out of the ship through the hole. It shrugged off any attempts to stop it, disappearing into the darkness of space.
The Engineers also peeked out of cover next to Adrova, their derpy faces darting left and right to try and see what happened. The sudden silence from gunfire and Sentient humming piqued their interest, but they, like the two Corpus, figures it was best to wait for a moment.~</span>

It seemed the random movement of cables had only made thing worse. Triggered something or other. The sounds of locks clicking and securing could be heard from within the door itself, and the screen flashed in an almost... dissatisfied manner. Honestly, it seemed disappointed by their attempt. Were they really being judged by a console?

And just when it seemed this was another dead end, like they would have to go another way completely... something happened. The console flashed again, and Corpus text scrolled down the screen blisteringly fast. Had they just utterly broken the system that badly? But then, something <em>good</em> happened.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">ADMINISTRATOR IDENTIFICATION ACCEPTED. RELEASING LOCKDOWN.</div>

And sure enough, a moment later, the sounds of those sames lock <em>un</em>locking could be heard, and the door that once blocked their way opened, revealing a blast door of all things immediately om thr other side. Soon enough, that too slid open. On the other side... The room ahead was rather small, more of a short hallway than anything. But, it was clear it was heavily secured. The blast door that had been seen moments before was... unusual, for something like this. An automated voice spoke up, before any of them would have a chance to enter at all.

And the other operatives, well... those that were bleeding, were bleeding a <em>lot</em>. They were dead, for sure.

They didn&#39;t look gross and infested, so they were probably supposed to be helpful. He scooted out of cover just a bit, trying to get a better look at the scene.

Infested tendrils lashed across the hole in the hull, thickening until the hole was sealed. The Engineers, still a bit giddy with the excitement of winning, danced around the Transference Chamber happily.
One of the Engineers, the tallest one, approached Efahz and underhand tossed him one of the breathing apparatuses from earlier. Afterwards, the creature waddled swiftly back towards Adrova. It stopped next to the towering (in relative terms) human figure and held out another breathing mask. At the same time, it gurgled reassuringly and patted his knee.
Efahz would likely experience some shortness of breath and perhaps even a minor cough due to the spores leaking in from the ship&#39;s main compartment. Putting on the mask would cause the symptoms to alleviate shortly.</span>

The chroma stood and shrugged. &quot;Listen, I just started tugging wires. I&#39;m just glad it did <em>something.</em> Now we just gotta...uh....keep that decontamination from happening, I guess?&quot;
He peered past the open door. &quot;Cut the power maybe?&quot;

Corpus tech was beyond his skill level. He wasn&#39;t sure how to do much past unplugging things and plugging them back in. &quot;There might be some kind of shut off...thing...on the other side.&quot;</span>

The console, unfortunately, seemed to have been more than a bit damaged from Lev&#39;s tampering. Something short-circuited, the screen flickered and shut off, and the whole console went dead. But the door ahead stayed open, and nothing much else seemed to happen around them. But maybe Kapak was right. What exactly would &#39;decontamination&#39; do to all of them? What were the trio going to do, now? Where would they go, from here?


<strong>CH-01</strong>
Finally, he was aware again. The last few... minutes? Hours? Days? Weeks? It had all been a daze, for him. But he was... for lack of a better word, awake again. Yes. Now, where was he? It... was that same cell. The empty, dark room.  But he wasn&#39;t alone, now. In the corners, there were... three figures. Yes, three. All humanoid, of course. Standing there, just waiting, with Chegar- No, with CH-01, in the middle.


<strong>OH BOY, THE ORBITER</strong>
Of course, Efahz accepted the mask. He didn&#39;t speak up, just fitting the mask on and finally taking a deep breath. That was a lot better, now. He hadn&#39;t been <em>entirely</em> sure why breathing was difficult, but this alleviated that. He leaned against a wall, taking another deep breath, sighing, and reloading his weapon. That had been a mess, huh? Adrova, meanwhile, had <em>not</em> been expecting either the engineer or the poke. He gasped, scooting back, before realizing it was just one of those... things. Albeit hesitantly, he took his own mask and managed to get it on. His hands just kept shaking, most likely just out of panic. This was a weird  situation, after all.

&quot;Is, um... is it over?&quot; He mumbled finally, peeking up and looking around.</span>

&quot;The decontamination will probably not harm you folks. Your frames have that thick metal epidermis- I don&#39;t. I&#39;ll get autoclaved to the Void, so maybe I&#39;ll wait here and you guys try to get through? If you can figure out how to disable the decontamination protocols from the other side, then I can get through. Otherwise I&#39;m going to have to find a alternative route.&quot;
Kapak shot a glance around the hallway they were waiting in, seeing if there were any alternative passageways to take.

~The Engineer gave Adrova another pat on the knee, squinting its eyes into &quot;n&quot; shapes (perhaps an attempt for the cyclostomatic-mouthed creature to smile). After a moment, the Engineers perked up, and quickly began scurrying across the ship to clean up the mess made from the skirmish. Bodies and robotic limbs were dragged into hidden places, scorch marks from energy weapons were wiped, debris was swept. Periodically, an Engineer would pause to stare at one of the idle Spectres standing in the central Orbiter compartment as it passed by.~</span>

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to leave you behind. We&#39;ll head through and see if there&#39;s a way to turn the thing off, yeah?&quot;

Seeing no other option without passing through decontamination, Leveret stepped forwards into the chamber. In the following moment of waiting, Leveret&#39;s thoughts wandered. Were Efahz and Adrova okay? Would he be able to get to Chegar in time?

Leveret rolled his shoulders and quieted his mind. There would be time for that later.</span>

The Frost scratched the back of his head, thinking through what had been asked of him.
“Ah, why not?” He said, beginning to step into the chamber, cold air beginning to flutter around him. “But knowing our luck, we’re gonna need to kick in the other door next.” A smirk strangely obvious behind the helmet.

With that, the pail green globe exploded into existence.</span>

So, thanks to the snowglobe, the two Tenno were able to make it through the checkpoint entirely unscathed. Considering that the group likely wouldn&#39;t be able to leave again until Clogori was dealt with, Leveret ended up deciding to stay back and take care of the wounded Corpus. So, with the group split up, the last two emerged from the other side of the checkpoint. What they saw was frankly probably expected. As the unmanned checkpoint shut its door behind them, they were faced with the long, metallic corridors of a Corpus ship, but... clean of Infestation.

The path ahead was still dimly lit, now deviod of pretty much <em>any</em> life. The corridors ahead branched like they would on any Corpus ship, but it just seemed so <em>empty</em>. Before, at least, there had been Infested growths and maggots, but now? Now there was pretty much nothing ahead. No crew, no proxies, even though it was clear <em>something</em> was here. Maybe this part had been evacuated, because of Svytoj and Kapak&#39;s presence?

<span class="pre pre--inline">Welcome back. Please report for debriefing immediately, and remember: Report any and all suspicious symptoms. Keep the workplace safe!</span> A clearly automated message said over the intercom a moment later. Something was definitely up. Then, another voice over the intercom.

<em>&quot;Keep moving, they... they&#39;re fortifying their inner labs. Pulled back every guard and proxy they have, and... They know you&#39;re here. The whole place is on lockdown, and they&#39;re trying to ambush you... Avoid the corridors, find another way through, but...&quot;</em> The automated voice was followed by <em>that</em>, of all things. A voice, panicked, whispering over the intercom. Very clearly directed at just the two Tenno. The voice was <em>definitely</em> unfamiliar. <em>&quot;Keep moving, you&#39;re close... Close to Clogori. Avoid their sensors, and keep moving forward...&quot;</em>

Another trap? Or some genuine attempt to help?</span>

&quot;Your... thing, Helminth, I-&quot; The voice returned for just a moment. There was definitely something... unnatural to it, like the <em>cadence</em> of the voice wasn&#39;t quite normal. Like if a voice could dip into the uncanny valley. There was a short pause, right as Svytoj did indeed see one of those security cameras so common to Corpus ships, previously blending in with the metal of the hallway itself, spring to life and begin its repetitive back and forth surveying. &quot;Just go. Find a waaaaaaa- a way in, past the next checkpoi-&quot;

Whether it was the intercom or the voice itself cutting off and becoming... distorted, was unclear. But just like that, the security camera ahead was disabled again. Like it turning on at all in the first place was a fluke. Besides that, the corridor ahead was frankly the most barren and empty thing either of them have likely seen in a Corpus ship. Security cameras and deactivated ceiling turrets remained, but it was empty of everything else. Proxies, crewmen, supply crates, barrels, <em>everything</em>. It was all moved elsewhere.</span>
