The survivors, grieving as they will, had mostly split off and separated their ways. Some drowning themselves in drink, debt, and other addictions. But fate couldn’t let go of such valuable assets, not yet. Just when the past seemed buried with the dead, the dead spoke. 

A message was sent out to anyone who could find it, using a secretive Remnant cypher and broadcasting from a nostalgic location upon Lua. Some managed to heed its call, some gathered others, and some even more failed to shake off the bonds of death. But one way or another, the broken and shattered remains of a deceased remnant of a once glorious whole staggered its way back together. The remnants of a remnant.</div>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Harsh scarlet light struck the scarred side of Disruptis’s face. The sandy winds of a desert’s night felt cool and invigorating to the touch, like the cold embrace of impending doom. The atmosphere screamed ‘go on the hunt, or go to sleep’. The yellow operator cracked half a grin.

<em>No better hunter than a Tenno.</em>

Disruptis currently sat positioned on the border of the lush green vegetation of Kawamo. Unfortunately, the heavily engineered greenery waned quickly without the presence of a couple drops of water. He managed to rebuild his contact databases and send a message out to each of his old allies in their new shaky alliance. One could only hope everyone would be able to focus on the task at hand.

The Tenno averted his eyes from their trance on the flare he had left smoking in the desert sediment and turned them to the sky. <em>They should be here any time now…</em> he thought.

A dark violet glow pulsed through every scar on Disruptis’s body once again as he channeled the Naramonic energy to his sight. The soft light encompassed his ebony eyes as well. The Tenno scoured his field of view for any sort of approaching object.</span>

<em>From behind the green, lit by the vermilion, adrift in the tide, he came
A mare - nay, a specter, denying being torn out of this reality
With each stride anchoring itself deeper and deeper
Material only once in the nocturnal gown</em>

As Vuko, clad in a torn, dark cloak, approached, Disruptis could feel it. Like the smell of ozone before a storm. The unbridled rage, thirst for vengeance, for mindless slaughter, emanating from him. 
He didn’t say a word. All that needed to be spoken, already has been.

He just stood there, awaiting as the desert breeze played with his mantle, revealing the outcome of horrors past.

A tug on the leg - revealing one limb is different than the other, more... crude, mechanical, fake

A sway to the side - showing the elongated visor, armored breastplate, and battacor held in his clutch

A push at the back - exposing a rigid posture, a zylok on the holster, and a scindo axe hidden underneath the cloak

Disruptis was not one to be surprised at such a sight. After all, he was his captor, savior and editor. 
Others, not so much. 
Seeing Vuko’s Ivara mended, altered and redone, could even come as shocking. The new look reminded almost nothing of the old, golden and proud Orokin style. It brings to mind a soldier, a mercenary, a hunter. A merger of Tenno and Corpus technology intertwined to result in something completely new and unique.</span>

Following close to the Frankenstein Ivara is none other than the ever so faithful behemoth of a kubrow. The crimson pelted beast gives his head a shake, his body not yet used to the refitted armor that his friend managed to make from high quality scrap in a quick hurry. He never did have need of protective gear, mainly cause Devros’ Oberon constantly supplied him with regeneration from whatever wounds managed to inflict him. But now, he does not have that protection and with a lot of nagging from Vuko’s side he managed to accept it and let the boy fit the armor on to his bulky frame. It was nothing fancy, the armor itself is mainly aimed to protect his head as well as provide some additional spikes on to his sides for other…uses.

While feeling restricted by it, he has a basic understanding that this uncomfortable “suit” will help him in some way so he’s willing to put up with the feeling. The kubrow gives his left front leg a wiggle to test the attachment on it and feels satisfied when it doesn’t just ping out. He takes his position left of Vuko and let’s his dull golden eyes scan the area, his one working ear rotating on top of his massive head while he constantly adjusts the armor on to his body with light twitches.</span>

&quot;Well, well, well, what is this here?&quot; Kapak seemed to appear from nowhere- a common trait of the Nidus. Always stealthy when not trying, but unbearably terrible at it with effort.
&quot;I guess I&#39;m not the only weirdo-frame in the group, now, am I?&quot; The mutant Warframe&#39;s mouth rested on a crooked grin as per usual.
Kapak sniffed.
&quot;Hmm. You smell funny. Must be all that machinery,&quot; Kapak said, reaching out to lightly flick the Ivara&#39;s prosthetics.
&quot;Really reminds me of the Strider&#39;s frame, huh? With all the missing bits and such. Say, has Disruptis told you &#39;bout that whole... thing?&quot;
Kapak paused to give Garhul a quick rub while peering at Disruptis. The Nidus&#39; lighthearted speech was obviously there to attempt and cheer up his comrades, but it was still abundantly clear that he wasn&#39;t oblivious to the still-high-strung tensions from earlier.</span>

Isa&#39;s Saryn arrived shortly after Kapak, bearing heavy orndance: a zarr, a modified angstrum purchased from none other than the illustrious Baro Kiteer, and her usual sentient  blade. She had been advised not to take an army of MOAs with her, much to her chagrin. Though given the wildlife here they would probably just draw more attention and possibly get ripped apart. Still, she had loaded a few onto her landing craft so it could fly in and release them once they reached camp.

&quot;I have a unit of MOAs on standby if we need them.&quot; She said, looking around to the others, giving a nod of acknowledgement to Vuko and his curiously repaired Ivara. &quot;So. Shall the hunt begin?&quot;</span>

Cev emerged from the forest and came running up to the group as well, clad in his Octavia warframe and already prepping a low, steady beat. The sound was only heard by the Tenno around him. “Ah muck sorry mates got a little distracted.” He said as he chuckled and rubbed the back of his neck nervously. His gaze darted over to vuko’s mangled form. “What happened to you mate?”</span>

“Yeah,” Disruptis quickly answered Isa, “be careful out there. I’ve put up an objective pointer on one of our old squad HUD frequencies. Get your cephalon to switch to it if you haven’t already. I’ll recap while you get set up.”

The Tenno cancelled his enhanced vision and let the colours of his skin return to normal. He walked towards the horizon opposite the lush forest. “Vuko shot an idea about getting into the nearest camp to nab some data on where our hostages went to. Then you can track them down and rescue them. That’s priority number one.”

Disruptis paused for a moment, considering his next words. He knew he really shouldn’t let himself talk, but the situation had changed and he wasn’t exactly sure of what to make of it anymore. “While it’ll probably be a nasty time trying to take down the camp-wide alarms, you can at least stop word getting out to the other drill sites. Now, while this is priority one, the main reason you’re here is to find out what kind of assistance the grineer are getting to help them push in across the desert so easily. If you can find that out we might get some leads to something <em>real</em> cool.”

He smiled after the last line and shifted his gaze into the bright sky for a second. There wasn’t much light pollution to hide the swirls of distant galaxies.</span>

The stoic figure kept silent as the dusk wind kept tarnishing his cloak. His hand reached out to scratch Garhul, an automatic, thoughtless act that has developed over the past months as a sort of coping mechanism.
The Nidus’ arrival made him feel... well, he wasn’t sure what. Had this been just a few hours prior Vuko no doubt would be cracking jokes alongside Kapak, both masking their pain in a shared, delusional comedy. 
Now? There was something intangible between them. The once doubtless faith in his friend was dimmed... by what could only be the seed of distrust.
“No, he hasn’t.” The jarred, modified voice of Vuko responded in a disheartened tone.

Isa’s arrival got in between what further development could have been had, causing the Ivara to turn to her, producing a glare that could be seen all the way through the warframe. The sharpness almost felt as two needles about to puncture the skin. “Is <em>this</em> your idea of stealth gear?” Vuko give the argument a moment to sink in, before continuing. “We won’t be taking any MOAs. Or using any explosives. You’re to stay put unless I say so, understood?” There wasn’t any room for leeway in the voice. He clearly had enough of her. Enough of it all. Enough of himself. Vuko manifested his pain not by crying. His eyes have long stopped doing it, else he would drown in his own tears.

Cev, late to join the party, was more or less left with no answer as Vuko just meaningfully looked at Disruptis in response, not bothering to say more.

“Let’s go.” He exclaimed to the team, as his feet left the remains of the grass, and stepped into the rough sand. His steps accompanied by nothing more than the grinding of the grains. Without waiting for anyone, the Ivara was heading through the narrow passage.</span>

Kapak watched Vuko stepping away from the group and sighed. He turned to Isa and shrugged, wiping saliva from his jaw.

&quot;Keep the Moas on standby in a nearby location,&quot; Kapak spoke in a low voice to Isa, &quot;we might need them. But, until then, we&#39;ll not. I&#39;m sure you brought enough tools to create distractions nonetheless?&quot; Kapak began to walk forward after Vuko, stopping briefly to lay a reassuring hand on Disruptis&#39; shoulder.

&quot;He hasn&#39;t had time to properly grieve,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;I can&#39;t smell his emotions from this new Warframe of his, but I can definitely tell he&#39;s distressed. We just have to get through these next few weeks without anyone ripping anyone apart.&quot;
Kapak shot Cev a quick glance as well. &quot;Look after him, eh?&quot;</span>

&quot;Yes.&quot;
She responded to Vuko&#39;s question with no hesitation. This was, in fact, her idea of stealth gear.
&quot;The blade is for stealth. The other weapons, including the MOAs are available as a contingency or distraction if necessary.&quot;
The grass moved a bit near her, not in any way the wind could affect it. Her kubrow appeared with a shimmer and a low growl. It was a large one, though not a hulking beast like Garhul. Ordo was a sleek Huras kubrow, a hunter skilled at silently stalking its prey. His master&#39;s hand gently reached out and rested upon his head.
&quot;Still. Stealth is far from my specialty. I fully intend to stick to the outskirts and stay hidden with Ordo&#39;s help. With or without silenced weapons, I would not be able to infiltrate the camp effectively, even with him. I will be on standby to provide support or a distraction if needed, and the MOAs are available to be dropped in via landing craft.&quot;
Her voice was perfectly civil and emotionless, with no attempt to argue, simply explaining her preparation as fact, with not a care in the world for what Vuko had to say about it. She had her methods and she stuck to them.</span>

The behemoth appreciated the scratches and touches on his pelt, in fact he welcomed them greatly, it made him feel…welcomed, loved, happy. I suppose you can say that what he is feeling is a spark of home and security. His ear kept track of the mouthed words that the two-leggeds were mumbling between themselves but his gaze was trained on the other kubrow in the mids. His nose wiggled in the air to absorb the information of the other, his mind thinking of food and play all of a sudden as if he was a pup again. Before he could make a move on the smaller kubrow Vuko broke off, snapping Garhul’s attention back at his friend.

The bulky kubrow quickly breaks in to a trot to follow after Vuko. Large he may be, lumbering and thundering, but a ignorant pup he is not and while he knows that he is not suited for stealth he is still a trained protector, and protect he shall!</span>

A sole singer joined in their voice, resonating with the tone to create a beautiful melody before cutting off and leaving everything in silence.

“Of course mate I’ll keep an eye on him,” He shook his head, turning to go after Vuko. “Oh and Isa,” he said without looking back, “maybe try not being a gut-brain for once in your life.”</span>

Something unseen flashed through Disruptis’s eyes as he regarded Vuko’s back with a neutral expression. His scarred fingers clenched and unfurled. <em>&#39;Void doesn’t give me enough for this,</em> he thought. A mostly nonsensical, incoherent ramble.

He turned to Isa and mouthed with a more tender smile. <em>Thank. You.</em> he mouthed. No further explanation, just a little bit of gratitude, even if the Tenno didn’t think much of it. Which she probably didn’t.

Fifteen minutes after leaving the fertile land of Kawamo, the group had reached the piece of land designated as ‘Safe Strait’. It was adequately named, as evident by the massive stretches of darker-colour sand flanking both sides. Their short walk, they had been hearing strange guttural sounds here and there in the distance. Now, they were also accompanied by sloshing.

“Oh!” Disruptis’s voice butt into the warframe’s comms. “The Grinner commander watching over the happenings here goes by the name ‘Corporal Mok’ just in case you wanted to know. Mucker’s got presence, that’s for sure. He ain’t that shabby of a chief, not that it makes our work any easier. He’s cunning. Not really that smart, just cunning.”</span>

“Understood.” Was all that came from him in view of the new information. He just kept going forward, following the course he had layed out on the map, hoping that others will just fall in line. 

While being silent on the outside, on the inside there was a raging conversation. He was... confused. Angry and confused. But mostly confused. In this self-absorbed state he pushed  on, ignoring what other things his squad had to say.</span>

Her voice was completely lacking in sincerity as she proceeded to block the music out of the comm channel. She would continue along, enjoying the sound of nothing more than the sound of their footsteps until the rumbling became audible.

It was getting closer. Isa shifted the grip on her Zarr into a more ready position. It clicked softly as she set it to flak mode. It continued to draw closer now... she stopped in her tracks and waited. It was coming for her from beneath the sand. She was ready when the worm made its appearance, leaping away from it, forward toward the others, twisting in the air  to fire a burst of flak at the beast, trying to aim for the mouth. She would be somewhat close to it when she fired still, though she would only be able to make one shot before her bullet jump carried her away from it.</span>

He felt the rumbling beneath his paws and he paused his run to look around, his one working ear dancing atop his head like a homing satellite. He yipped towards Vuko, hoping to grab the others attention but that bark was overshadowed by the tumbling appearance of the worm. He watched, in utter surprise and horror at the display of it. Never has he seen something that lives to be that huge.

But he had little to dwindle on it as the worm started to trash about. The behemoth dashed towards Vuko’s side, ready to boost shields or be mounted if need be for his four legs carried faster and his bulk was enough to support the Ivara.</span>

After the worm dug itself into the sand and the sights of Vuko’s battacor, he stood there with an absentminded look in his eyes, trying to figure out what to do in this situation.

One of Kapak’s sentences did however get through to him. “Stop!” He urgently let out to Kapak. “That’s a bad idea. You’ll get swallowed in the sands.” He said, surprising himself that he still cared about the Nidus. 

“We should move on, the faster we get to the camp the better. I’m changing the order. Isa, you go first with that cannon of yours at the ready. Closely behind you Cev and then Kapak. Cev, focus on cloaking the two of them, and Kapak try to... I don’t know sense it or something? I’ll be covering your back in prowl.” As he ended Vuko stepped to the side of the straight, giving room for everyone to pass him by while he went into prowl.

In the meantime his a bit shaking hand reached towards Garhul and started petting him, but it looked like it was more to cool his nerves rather than for the Kubrow.</span>

The Saryn nodded sagely and took the lead. She switched the Zarr into its cannon mode, as the flak seemed less effective than she would have liked. She moved somewhat slowly, listening carefully for the worm, but did switch on the annoying Octavia tunes at this point, keeping their volume as low as possible. Ordo took his place at her heels, his ears swiveling about as he listened for the creature that had attacked his master. There was a  small <em>thunk</em> as Isa loaded another shot down the muzzle of the cannon. It was a good thing she hadn&#39;t opted for stealth gear.</span>

Back in the original meeting room, the yellow Tenno scurried past wood ornaments and silk curtains to the far side of the pavillion. He picked apart a table cluttered with canvas, paper, and worn books until he found one with a burgundy cover.

<em>Didn’t expect them to run into anything quite yet…</em>

A raging inferno spewed forth from the worm’s maw, breaking through the quiet darkness. The beast whipped its singed head back and forth three times, then flung itself upon the sand. There it lay still, slowly being swallowed by the wet sands. The fiery embers quietly retreated from existence in plumes of smoke and ash.

Then something surfaced.

It was a dark object. Two pulsating blue rings flanked either side of it. From the Tenno’s perspective, it was merely a sphere mostly submerged in sand some ten meters away.

Then, another came. It showed no light.

Then, another. And another. And another. Without a sound, the pools of sediment surrounding the group dotted itself with… things, lurking in the dark.

Nothing made a move.~</span>

He hurriedly started walking towards the end of the straight as fast as he could without breaking the cloak. “Move your butts along. I don’t want to stay long enough to find out what those things are.”</span>

The cloaking stuttered slightly before stabilizing as they continued forward. 

Cev ceremonious plucked a small ball resting on the hip of his warframe and pressed a button on the top of it. It pulsed three times as he then threw it over his shoulder, then rapidly expanded upon hitting the ground into a resonator. Finally, he ordered it to continue back they way they had came while pumping his music through it.</span>

Disruptis let out some of the breath he found himself holding. Things weren’t that bad. The Tenno paused his fanning of the worn book, his eyes resting on a page depicting a gigantic toad-like creature sporting tentacles from its neck and appendages.

“Alright, just back off with a cloak on. We really don’t have the time to be poking the nest of a beehive thousands of acres wide,” Disrupits commented. After the words left his mouth, he immediately regretted it and bit down on his tongue. He needed to stop.

~Six of the nearest objects sunk back beneath the surface as the group walked away underneath a cloak. It was obvious that they had made the right choice to walk away when they did, as after travelling not a couple meters away from the roller six gigantic worms with their own unique mutations burst from the sands. They all lunged for Cev’s resonator like a bunch of Tenno all diving for a Lunaro near the end of a match.

What little neon light the roller brought forth into the darkness was swallowed whole by a descending wall of darkness.~

“Oh, and now that you’re near the other side, you should conceal yourself as much as possible,” Disruptis continued, switching tone, “Remember those chiroptera creatures I was mentioning earlier? The Akuul? Well, night time’s meal time for them. They occasionally manage to make a pass on village stock, but they tend to throw their parties out where you are. While you’ll be able to trick their sharp eyes with a cloak, you won’t be able to get away from th&#39; echolocation. They use both quite well, trust me.”

~Vuko, Cev, and Isa neared the end of the strait. The night was just starting and they were already in hot water. Unfortunately, much like a local Plutonian business man whipping out his second line of magic powder in under an hour, their mission was just getting started.

The strait ended where large, sloping dunes began. The entrance do this elevated dune area formed a kind of a half-bowl facing the Tenno. Blocking the way onwards, however, was an eight-meter tall feline. Its textured fur blended into the backdrop of sand as it stared down the strait with large black eyes. The hunter crouched low, poised to pounce.

Its muscles were wound-up spring traps ready to burst forth on some unsuspecting prey, tail subtly twitching back and forth. The only one to notice the beast at first were the Kubrows&#39; sharp noses.

Meanwhile, a short stretch of distance behind, Kapak popped back into sight. He wasn’t near Cev anymore to get his benefit from his melodies. A cluster of the other murky objects in the sands began slinking towards him.~</span>

He gave Isa a gloating look after Disruptis told them to stay hidden, almost as if the Ivara’s visor was saying ‘I told you so.’ with a smug face.

“We go single file, everyone step where Isa steps, I don’t want the enemy to know how many of us there are. C’mon, let’s move it.” He started to move his hand in circles, pressuring them to go forward. “Let’s keep the formation Isa, Cev, and... Kapak?” Vuko started to look around confused, only now realising he’s missing a person. “Where the-“ His sentence interrupted by the Nidus showing up behind them on the strait, about to be pounced. “Oh by the void!”

Without a moments hesitation Vuko straightened his back into a proper archery position while a long, straight, sleek, bow made out of a composite alloy appeared in his hands. Not three seconds passed by before he had already pulled and released the string, sending an arrow with a delicate ‘whoosh’ straight into Kapak’s torso. The projectile would give Kapak about ~20 seconds of invisibility.

All the while the Ivara was completely blind to the beast, as not only was it blending in with the surrounding but he also has turned its back to it.</span>

He kept close to Vuko, despite the chaos of the worm, of the lights and the explosions he kept his calm and trailed behind the stealthy archer, cloaked just as him. He’s seen battle and war as much as any Tenno, been on the front lines from the start of it all, defending and protecting. He watches what Vuko does and how he moves, knowing the ques from the smallest of movements, movements he started understanding from his time with the Tenno on that lonely island.

But then…something unusual came about. A scent! What is it? Where is it? Garhul started sniffing the air, his ear and head whipping about to spot the source of it. There! Is it?

The kubrow quickly halted his advancement, turned around to face the direction of the prowling feline, his posture tall and threatening as he let out a deep rumbling growl, not loud enough to break his stealth but loud enough for Vuko to know that something was up.</span>

Isa was entirely clueless to the smug look. Staying hidden was wise, but they didn&#39;t have the equipment to remain hidden from a worm. Hopefully they wouldn&#39;t encounter anything else like that. She continued along after being given approval by Vuko. As they continued, Ordo let out a slow growl and nudged the Saryn&#39;s leg. She immediately came to a halt, raising her  hand to signal for the others to stop as well.

Her head swiveled to gaze on Garhul as well, then looked to see where that kubrow was looking. &quot;There&#39;s something here.&quot; She said over comms. She raised her Zarr to a ready position, searching the area. &quot;I&#39;ll wait on you to fire now.&quot; She said, turning her head slightly toward Vuko. &quot;Given your frame&#39;s sensory capabilities, it may be best for you to take the lead.&quot;</span>

The Invisibility arrow from Vuko’s bow wasn’t designed to hurt, but was enough to snap Kapak back to his senses.
“By the Orokin, what in the Void just happened?” Kapak stood up fully, his bone armour vibrating slightly to shake the sand from the cracks and crevices along his Warframe.
He looked around for a moment, seeing where the others were. He lifted an arm, noticing the blurry, unfocused, translucent appearance and realized he was cloaked.
Now empowered by the apparent safety of invisibility, Kapak began to jog over the the rest of the group, oblivious to anything else that was currently happening.</span>

The flapping, no, <em>beating</em> of wings in the night sent a very faint draft of cool desert breeze cascading over the group. The camouflaged feline straightened, eyes darting back and forth around the starry night sky. It shivered.

Meanwhile, Kapak found nothing attempting to make a move, that he could see. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught something flicker over top of the wet sands. Even if he had stopped to take a chance to look it wouldn’t have yielded anything, for a gigantic black pillar rose out of the sediment and swallowed it whole.~</span>

“Huh?” He exclaimed, Gargul’s growl ticking him off. “Yeah, Garhul’s picking up too. I’m investigating.” With that, Vuko raised his battacor into firing position and began charging a heavy blast. Carefully placing his footsteps, he began slowly advancing forward towards whatever the Kubrows were feeling. Before he could get whatever it was within his radar range, the strange pitch reached his warframe. “Cev, what is that? Give me an analysis.” He commanded, not changing his pace.</span>

“Void that didn’t last long at all…” Disruptis mumbled to himself, briefly switching off his comms for the uttering. “Yeah, we’re in a little hotter water now that you started travelling this late. That’d be the akuul you’re hearing: they just started to hunt.”

Disruptis leafed through the book until he found a page depicting a bat-like monster. “Your invisibility’s gonna be pretty useless against those things. You’ll be able to kill ‘em, especially with Vuko’s exalted bow, but there’s gonna be a lot of ‘em.”

He slammed the book shut with one hand. “You’re not that far from the drill now. You should be safe from them there. Personally, I’d feel this is a great time to get some air in your lungs—and <em>run</em>.”</span>

Which one to choose... which one do go through on.... He could try taking out the beast in front of him and turn around to face the akuul. Or maybe switch places and use the animal as a shield? Or... or... or.....

Once the Nidus turned to ask Vuko about his Artemis, he would quickly realize that the frame was no longer there and all that was left is a comical trail of sand rising upwards. Heeding the warning the Ivara was already dashing for dear life in the direction of the drill.</span>

Clearly it was not expecting that, but the adrenaline pumping through its nervous system let it recover quickly. It immediately decided to pounce on Vuko. 

But as it began its jump, the beast was broadsided by something dark. It crashed into the sandy dune with a spectacular spray of sediment, writhing and thrashing. Two dark-blue figures both about half the size of the cat assaulted it in the night.

The clamour of screeching and flapping grew louder and louder, filling the skies of the expansive desert around the Tenno. As the group reached the top of the dune, he spotted the distant glow of the drill station past many dune hills and slopes. The terrain wasn’t going to give them a straight run, but perhaps that was more advantageous for dealing with attackers. The only problem was that the drill station still sat at least a ten minute run away.

Or rather, not the only problem, since they also found ominous storm-clouds looming in the distance.~</span>

Hearing the thunderous claps of wings swirling around him only filled him with confidence that his decision to run was correct.

Knowing that he isn’t of much use on an open field with enemies in close range, Vuko didn’t even slow down in his run towards the drill. He even summoned his bow, Artemis, mid run as per Disruptis’ advice. 

To make his run shorter and gain a bit of mobility, he started shooting zip lines to connected the dunes. This should give him the ability to dodge an incoming air attack not only to the sides, but also downward, as well as make it easier to shoot and look further back as his path has already been set.</span>

The Nidus shook its head as it watched Vuko propelling himself at a very high velocity towards the target, unsatisfied with the lack of answer.
He sighed and shrugged to the air before trudging behind the rest of the group, lazily watching the rest of his squad acrobatically advancing forward.
Kapak double checked his Tigris’ barrels to ensure it was loaded before sitting down on the top of the first dune and slowly sliding down like a crippled slug.</span>

He was ready to protect and assault whoever or whatever dared threaten Vuko, but that didn’t seem to be needed as something far greater took out the feline. Talk about a brush with lady luck! The rust colored kubrow didn’t linger too long on the bloody display and simply kept by Vuko’s side. Even when the Ivara ziplined in to the air, he remained on the ground, running just bellow him, keeping in perfect synch with his friend. He eyed the air and the state of the dunes, and simply charged at it! he went up by the sheer power of his limbs and slid down on his - OOPS - he trips and rolls the rest of the way down in a show of spectacular derpy grace and fashion, meeting the level sand bellow head first like a ostrich. But he does not let that stop him and quickly pulls his head out, spits and snorts the particles from his nose before he kicks himself off in to a sprint, the sand imbedding in to his fur and brushing close to his eyes.</span>

In one moment, Isa saw him running ahead of her, and in the next, he was gone. All of the air in the Tenno’s lungs were punched out of him when he suddenly found himself flying through the crisp wind. He landed with a back-breaking blow and skipped across the sand.

Then Isa herself found a flying object, albeit slower, approaching her from behind.

A creature plucked Kapak out of his slide and threw him onto the opposite hill before he could react. It clamped down onto the sediment in front of his feet and <em>screeched</em>. In the dim light of the stars and his own headlamp, the Nidus witnessed a scaly beast that stood up to his neck. Long, leathery wings stretched into the night-lit desert on either side of it. Its vaguely alligatorinae head swung down to chomp Kapak’s head off.

Cev was lucky. While he was sliding, another one of the creatures took a pass at him but missed, barely scraping him with its claws. Then it proceeded to crash into the ground and tumble painfully down the hill, making panicked shrieking noises all the way.~</span>

Without a clue or strategy in mind he was getting a desperate. They were sitting ducks on an open field. 
“Everyone group up at the end of the zip line!” He called out, hoping both that all will make it in time and that moving as a group will give them a better chance. 

“Garhul!” He called out with his own voice, wanting the Kubrow by his side, as he began moving for the call point.</span>

The Tenno continued on running along the zipline for a moment to get the time to draw her sword, then turned around, sliding a bit backwards from her own momentum before propelling herself in the opposite direction, toward the shadow that was previously behind her, her sword arm held across her body, ready to swing the Sentient blade in a wide arc in front of her just before impact. She knew she couldn&#39;t outrun this thing, so the most reasonable course of action was to kill it. 

Her kubrow had previously been bounding along behind Garhul. While tall, he was slim and graceful unlike the hulking beast that was Garhul.

<em>What a magnificent thing!</em> Kapak thought to himself, <em>So fast... so silent! Perhaps... tasty?</em>
In a flash, Kapak&#39;s two arms grabbed onto the scale-bound being&#39;s jaws, pushing backwards to stop its advance. He screeched, and three tendrils erupted from his chest, entering the monster&#39;s throat.

Out of the corner of his eye he spotted Ordo bounding towards the bird-like reptile to assist. Kapak couldn&#39;t help but hiss at the kubrow, as if he were an alpha predator defending his catch from wily scavengers.</span>

However, the Nidus proved to be no lightweight. He completely halted the creature’s advance and even reversed the situation, successfully feasting on its insides while all it could do was squirm.

When wielding a sword, often times velocity proved itself more important than the size or sharpness of a blade. Isa was given the opportunity to witness this once more as she swung at her pursuer. It tried to dodge to the side, but was much too late. The combined momentum of the weapon and the animal’s flight cleaved the thing half-way down its torso before launching it into the sands below. It was a satisfying moment.

But it didn’t last long.

The Saryn’s arms were grabbed with an iron-like grip, then she found herself hoisted into the air. Another akuul had snuck up on her from behind. It clamped its maw down onto her and attempted to rip away the sword-steel surrounding her neck with vicious intensity.

Cev’s opponent swiftly recovered itself and leaped to the side. About a quarter of his bullet-stream managed to tear its way into its hide, but that didn’t stop it. It bounded into his range and clamped down on his neck in the same way its kind had been doing to the other Tenno. Knocking Cev to the ground, its teeth found the grooves in his warframe’s armour, cutting into his flesh a little during the struggle to find a good position.

Vuko hadn’t lost his speedy assailant yet. A much larger akuul than his friends had dealt with blanketed the sky in front of him. He didn’t have any time to react as it lunged upon him with ferocity, digging talons into his sides. His armour barely held. Vuko was dragged across the sands on his back from the assault, all the while his intimidating foe roared.~</span>

Isa felt herself rising higher into the air than she had intended. These things were getting irritating now. Its teeth failed to penetrate through the combination of armor and shields of the Saryn. She thrust upward with her sword, plunging it into the creature repeatedly, occasionally swinging upwards to try to catch its wings with the blade. Once she manage to kill it, if it didn&#39;t release her, she would skewer it on the sword to pry it off of herself so she could see where she was about to land.</span>

With a fair bit of effort thanks to hitting the ground constantly, Vuko reached for the scindo on his back, while letting his bow dissipate into nothingness.

It shrieked and gurgled as a stream of blood brushed the Saryn’s back in crimson. Muscular claws relinquished their iron grip on her, and the two began a freefall from 200 meters in the air. Sand was supposed to be soft, right?

The alpha akuul jumped off of Vuko right as the axe touched its leg, allowing the swing only time to scrape at the beast. This wasn’t incredible reaction time though, but more a response to Garhul’s sturdy grip on it. The akuul cried out in pain and tried to shake the oversized kubrow off, to no avail. Instead it changed its tactic to attack. 

It sunk its teeth into Garhul’s sandy back.

The poor akuul’s head was brutally ripped apart. Kapak only received a split second to assess the situation with the other Tenno before another pair of wings crashed into him. They seemed unfearful of their friend’s terrible demise, but cautious. This time two of the winged menaces pinned each of his arms onto the cool dunes and peered down at his body, like they were waiting to see what he would do.~</span>

However, despite the agony, he remained latched on to the creature. He hardens his bite, even starting to tug and pull against the creature, determined to keep it in place like a heavy anchor, or at least slow it, and distract it enough to give Vuko the opportunity to deliver a killing blow.</span>

Two hundred feet. Three and a half seconds to impact. The firmness or softness of the sand wasn&#39;t really a concern with that point as the Tenno had plenty of time to react, orienting herself so she was falling chest first with her arms spread. About one second before impact she used a small amount of void energy to slow her fall and glide the rest of the way down, turning herself to land on her feet with ease. She would land with grace provided her fall wasn&#39;t interrupted by any more akuul, though she did keep her blade at the ready to take a swing at any that came for her.

Meanwhile, her kubrow had hesitated when Kapak hissed at him, though the second two other akuul beset the Nidus, he was midair, pouncing on one of the creatures that had latched onto his ally.</span>

Red flooded his eyes as Vuko leapt into the air slightly above the creature, intent on chopping the weaseling things into little bits. With all the pent up anger, he aimed his axe at the base of its neck.

A moment after it, he heard what sounded like an over-bassed explosion, causing him to stagger, feeling all of his insides rumble, and grab the sides of his head. He momentarily started seeking the source of the sound, once recovered.</span>

Despite Isa’s cunning attempts to slow down, she hit the ground hard and fell over, losing her grip on her blade in the process. The akuul she expertly felled slammed into the ground next to her, sending a spray of sand onto her back. A couple more figures circled her in the air, but didn’t seem brave enough to make an immediate move after seeing her in action.

The akuul’s eyes went wide as dinner plates as Cev shoved a glowing sphere down its throat. Light illuminated its stomach, casting shadows of its veins across the dunes before a massive tremor rocked through its innards, tearing them into pieces at microscopic levels. It instinctively drew backwards to escape danger, but it was too late. Most of the bones in its body had been fractured, and the ones nearest to the sound wave were ground to powder. It fell over dead without a chance to even twitch.

Kapak’s enemy clearly wasn’t expecting the Nidus to grow a blade on his hand, so it screeched as the first stab caught it in a soft-spot in its tough carapace and leapt off him too. Its belly bled onto the dry desert sand as it regarded him. The other akuul pounced on Isa’s kubrow with intense ferocity, clamping its gigantic maw onto its neck and back, much like a cat picking up a young one but with more violent intent.</span>

She looked around, assessing the situation a moment before heading in the direction of her kubrow and Kapak, though she was rather confident Ordo could handle himself against the creature trying to pounce on him.

Ordo was circling around for another pounce as the akuul latched onto his back. He brought his forepaws up to try to claw away and push it off of him.</span>

The second akuul had seen enough. First its prey pulls a sharp object out of his mucking arm and then reaches inside his chest to retrieve yet another deadly weapon? It was smart enough to recognize what it was dealing with. Steeling itself to power through the pain of its gut, it turned away and leapt into the air.

Garhul was dragged across the sand like an over-sized garden rake. Vuko struggled up the akuul’s flailing back, but managed to hold on. The akuul him and reflexively slammed his back down onto the ground, knocking the wind out of the Tenno and bruising his stomach. The axe fell out, trailing dark-red blood through the night.~</span>

Oh shet! The kubrow got dragged across the harsh and coarse sand that got everywhere under his fur, such a irritating thing. But HUZZAH! At the end of his struggle he came out of it with a chunk of flesh in his maw...along with a really hard barrel roll that send him tumbling a few meters away from the force. Under any other circumstances, the companion would have eaten the meat but this is no time for munching, it&#39;s a time for fighting!

Garhul spit the flesh from his mouth and swiftly got up on his paws, not even giving his fur a shake from the sand, or the fact that it got in to his opened wound causing a fresh wave of pain to ripple through him. No time for that either! He saw the creature about to body slam Vuko, causing a wave of panic and urgency to rush through him. The kubrow clenched his jaw, widened his stance, lowered his head and closed his eyes. The Raksa kubrows may not be ferocious like the Sunika, sneaky like the Huras, resourceful like the Sahasha or quick like the Chesa, but it possesses something deeper, a string that binds them to those worthy of their undying loyalty, a bond that lasts a lifetime and even beyond. Through this connection they aid their Tenno, they follow them, they protect them.

Garhul does just that, he boosts Vuko&#39;s shields - like a sudden spherical ball of energy around him - just before the Akuul slammed him down, absorbing most of the damage, transferring it to Garhul.</span>

“Oh I’m so done with yoouuuuu....” He screamed out as the Akuul was smashing him against the ground, his shout culminating in a loud <em>’thump’</em> that raised a good bit of sand around them. Surprisingly enough, Vuko felt barely any pain other than the impact knocking the wind out of his lungs. He knew where all the damage had gone however. Garhul. Turning his head instinctively towards his companion, he saw the fearless Kubrow taking the brunt of the damage onto his battered and bruised self.

‘This is far too dangerous.’ He thought to himself. ‘It’s one thing when I’m risking my own skin, but with Garhul standing in between me and damage, I’ll have to be more cautious.’ In line with those words, he bolted some meters away from the beast the second there was an opening, grabbing his axe along the way and swinging it back onto his back, and summoned his exalted bow once more. “You’re gonna regret hurting my friend.” Vuko said towards the bird the moment he let an arrow loose, putting in extra effort to ensure it lands in its glistening eyeball.</span>

The powerful arrow shot straight through the large akuul’s head and slammed into the sand on the other side. The creature was tossed to the ground by the impact, spraying one last wave of sand into the night air. It moved no more. 

With the final foe and leader felled, the rest of the akuul flapping their wings in the distance took off into the pale night. The breeze was lined with dust and sediment: a result of the parties’ struggles. Blood leaked out from the many slaughtered enemies to stain the sands with signs of combat. These dunes held no remorse, but would soon deal with the aftermath in its own way.

The Tenno observed the quiet night ambience trickle in once again.~</span>

That felt like a big SLAP as he felt the force transferred to him, his bruised body only getting more bruised but he doesn’t mind, it’s what he was trained for! When the beast got murdered by Vuko, the kubrow let out a mighty and gleeful bark, as if congratulating the Ivara on the kill, his one ear straightening up and his mouth gaping to let out some of the heat that has accumulated in his body.

He started walking towards Vuko but winced when he felt the coarse sand that got in to the opened wound between his shoulders rubbing and cutting inside, like hundred of tinny little nails. It’s really irritating! He let out a annoyed huff and tried to bend his neck to somehow lick it clean…but failing due to his own thickness and the position of the bleeding wound itself.</span>

Kapak tore the akuul’s brain from its cradle, lifting it over his head as he unleashed a bloodcurdling screech. He crushed the organ, showering himself in grey matter as blood flowed down his arm.
As Kapak licked his fingers clean, he jerked his head towards Vuko and Garhul. The scent of Kubrow blood permeated the air, and the Nidus soon found himself kneeling next to the bulky beast, weaving the laceration shut with one hand while he stroked his fur with the other.
“Vuko, you alright?” Kapak asked the Ivara without turning his head from his patient, “Isa, Cev, you guys alright too?”</span>

“This took way longer than necessary...” He said with a sigh of relief once the beast has finally fallen. Before he even had the chance to alert Kapak about the Kubrows state, the Nidus was already there, patching him up.

“I’m fine for the most part, focus on Garhul.” He said, sitting down on the sound, clearly exhausted by the fight. “Am I the only one who so much trouble with these muckers? I can’t be <em>that</em> rusty.”</span>

She said as she walked over to her Kubrow, inspecting his wounds. He was bleeding but things looked mostly superficial. He could go on without Kapak&#39;s healing for now. She gave him a pat on the head before turning to Vuko.
&quot;It looks like you had to deal with the largest one, probably the leader of the flock. I can see why the Grineer wouldn&#39;t try to cross the desert on foot, though I&#39;m still not sure what would prevent them flying over in dropships.

He let out a pleased huff as he felt someone tending to that pesky wound, the strokes calming down his nerves. The kubrow lifts his head to give the Nidus a chain of wet and slobbery licks on his cheek as a show of gratitude...meaty but this meaty taste is connected to a friend so he will not eat it.</span>

&quot;Weirdass creatures,&quot; Kapak said as he strode over to Cev, &quot;I wonder if these were created by the Orokin like the rest of the things on this planet... or are they natural? Perhaps an evolution of ancient Orokin genetically modified organisms?&quot;
A fleshy tube with a toothed barb end extended from Kapak&#39;s side. He took it in his hand and stuck it unceremoniously into Cev&#39;s side. Kapak&#39;s own cells flooded the Warframe, quickly replenishing lost blood and closing the Octavia&#39;s neck wound.</span>

With an unnecessarily loud groan, he pushed himself off the sand, and got up. “It’ll be better if I do it.” He said, whilst cracking his neck, and twirling his shoulders, as if stretching after a rest. “Just make sure you’re all not too far away.”
However after trying to activate his cloak, something went awry as Vuko clutched his side and flinched, no doubt the aftermath of the giant bird prying it’s claws inside him. Before the others had to say anything about it though, he performed the maneuver again, this time successfully, and started making his way towards the outpost unseen.</span>

“It’s... trash.” He said in disbelief, expecting to already have reached the rig. The Ivara stood there for a moment, almost expecting something to happen, as the cold desert wind pulled on the tarnished cloak. “All I’m seeing is a ship junkyard. Are you sure I’m in the right place?” Vuko asked as he continued moving forward, the cloth that was supposed to keep sand out of his systems doing almost nothing as he kept being barraged by grains. ‘Great.

Disruptis let out the breath he was unconsciously holding. He was way too on edge about this, knowing full well what might lie ahead. “It’s probably just junk from Grineer vehicles. Gather everyone and move on, it’s time we get the real act started.

~Vuko, Isa, Kapak, and Cev trudged through the sand uneventfully until they lifted their feet atop the final dune. From there, the desert quickly sloped downwards and levelled out to make room for the Grineer. A large deep-surface drill dominated the center of a community of buildings, slowly grinding away the midnight oil. Only low-level lights dared attempt to pierce the dimly star-lit night, as if the complex itself was wary of the desert it called home. Paint chips spattered across the outside of the structures’ walls retold the story of harsh desert winds alongside the usual husky-red propaganda art. 

Three towers anchored the whole fort’s presence into the sandy landscape—two ballista watch-posts and one thin device that looked more like a tall radio antenna. The details of the camp were obscured from the Tennos’ distance by a gigantic net covering the entire place with only the antenna in the middle to hold it up. Other than those three, there were four more buildings of indeterminable use.

The cool breeze continued to billow any cloth hanging from the groups&#39; bodies.~</span>

The Nidus knelt on one knee at the summit of the dune, careful to not send sand shifting down the slope towards the encampment. A Codex scanner materialized in his hand, which he brought to his eyeless skull.
&quot;Nothing out of the ordinary that I can see from here,&quot; Kapak mused as he looked over the buildings, &quot;No scanners or surveillance drones, no Akkalaks or Morddas, no Vruushes in case we need fast Archwing extraction...&quot;
Kapak hummed.
&quot;Seems rather unguarded. I guess they don&#39;t expect a Tenno-mounted raid. There&#39;s a Voiddamn net in the way of the view from here though, so I can&#39;t get a clear look. Oi, Cephalon! You still online? Make yourself useful and scan the camp for digital weakpoints, would you? Find any distress signal protocols or other crap.&quot;
Kapak lowered the scanner and turned to the others.
&quot;Well, we can do this the quiet way or the fun way. Vuko, I know you can take out the Ballistas in 2 seconds if need be, so we won&#39;t have to worry about Grineer taking <em>t&#39;teakit&#39;j</em> potshots at us if things get heated. I&#39;m mostly concerned if they can call in backup and before we know it, we have a Fomorian bombing us from orbit.&quot;</span>

He stood right of Vuko and went over the camp with his senses, by the order of how he perceives everything around him: 
Smell
Sound
Sight

Smell - the strongest of the senses in his arsenal, it guides him through life, it tells him when someone is frightened, when they&#39;re in a panic induced craze, where the food is at, it tracks his prey, it tells him when it will rain, where the enemy is, who is friendly, it keeps him living. And right now he wiggles his bended nose in the air, trying to absorb any smells coming from the camp, while he is a distance away from it you cannot overestimate the power of the desert wind that carries particles across the entire savannah. Be it sweat from the Grineer, or the putrid smell of machinery and oil, he inhales it all

Sound - after his nose is done sniffing, it&#39;s his ears - er well - ear - that come in to play. He rotates it in the general direction of where his nose is pointing him to. If there are smells coming from there then there also must be sounds that can paint a better picture in his head. Is it a big or small enemy, is it close to dying, is it tired, is it leafy in nature...questions and answers fill his head as his ear bounces from left to right.

Sight - colors to Garhul are duller than what other perceive, red and yellow shades are non existent and for this he doesn&#39;t rely on his eyesight as much. His nose picks up the world around him, his ears fleshes it out, and his eyes only guide him away from smacking in to obstacles. Still, he observes the camp, not understanding much of what he&#39;s seeing from this distance but he catches on to the Grineer, knowing that they are flesh he&#39;s allowed to chew.

To the gang around him, they will see the kubrow standing still and looking at  the camp, only his nose and ear wiggling, redirecting and refocusing. The breeze caresses his crimson fur, like a cold yet comforting touch.</span>

<em>It all was code for him. Strings of it flying through the datascape. But where his own was enormous in its size, others were less liberating. Most of the hardware outside the Spire was...lackluster compared to his own, due to hundreds of years of technological stagnation and more often than not connecting to something like someone else&#39;s Orbiter, landing craft or any other device was like getting imprisoned in a room with a door and a window of thick glass. Unpleasant.

Thank Himarius this particular device had a hole in the glass.
He looks through, searching  for any outgoing signal, or any place/piece of tech that could allow such a thing.</em></span>

The Ivara crouched down next to the Nidus, silent and keen on what he had to say. As the news of the low level of security was flowing in, he hummed in approval for each piece. “Hmm.. yes.. I agree Kappy. We don’t know how many reinforcements they have available. So as to whether stealth or fun, I say why not both?”

He stepped back from the peak, calling everyone to gather in a circle.
Vuko bent down low on one knee, and began a rough sketch of the area they’re about to infiltrate with his finger. “Since this is a small outpost, they shouldn’t have more than one transmitter tower.” 
He began a line from their current position to the antenna. “Kapak and Isa, you two will head straight for the radio and put it out of commission, while I cover you from up here. I trust given enough time you can use your infestation to tear it down, Kapak. If that does not work or you get spotted, Isa’s got heavy ordinance.” He looked at the Saryn, knowing she’d really enjoy the latter.

“While you two are busy taking down their communications.” He began drawing another line, this time curved, heading around the watchtowers, straight into the heart of the camp. “Cev and I will sneak inside, and attempt to capture an asset valid for intel extraction. Probably a commander or some other high ranking bastard.”

Vuko finished the sketch by marking a big ‘X’ in the middle of the camp where the drill is. “This is our rendezvous point if all goes to shit. It should be an easily defensible position as the grineer should be scared of shooting at it in fear of damaging their precious equipment or blowing it up by accident. And if we get pinned down... like I said, it’s highly combustible.” He finished up with a tone that is the equivalent of a cheeky wink.

“Do you see any flaws in my plan, cephalon?” He asked, making sure that there isn’t some pertinent information Elo found.</span>

The Saryn quietly stood behind Vuko, looking over his Ivara&#39;s shoulder as he drew in the sand. She wouldn&#39;t particularly enjoy destroying the transmitter, but was certainly equipped to do so. &quot;I can manage if Kapak&#39;s infestation fails. I could stay outside near the walls if you take out the lookouts and jump in if needed. Stealth is not my strong suit, and as such it would be best to use me as a contingency if things go wrong.&quot;

She turned to her kubrow. &quot;Ordo, heel.&quot; The tall yet lean kubrow walked over to stand beside her. &quot;My kubrow should be able to keep me cloaked for an approach. But I doubt he will manage to get me all the way to a tower.&quot;</span>

It was resting in Cev’s possession as Elo ran his scans. He reached out with invisible fishing lines, catching the middle of electronic Grineer transmissions through the air. He sniffed a strange signal in the midst of the sea of data he was working on decoding.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
“Okay, game time.” Disruptis announced, readjusting his transmitter. “Just before you head in, let me let you in on the down-low for the security in this thing. First of--”

~Three seconds into Elo’s scan and mid-way through Disruptis’s sentence, it hit.

A wave of terrible interference.

Everything fizzed out at once. Each of the Tenno were cut off from communication with the outside world with an ear-grinding electronic screech. Disruptis’s channel vanished, connection to cephalons vanished, even comms between the Tenno turned fuzzy, though not unusable. Elo’s mind operating in milli-seconds, he found himself with a split-second decision: keep an instance of himself running inside the beacon, or disconnect entirely and separate himself from the squadron. In the meantime, deadly abnormal interference leapt up the connection and right into his databanks, corrupting bits left and right.

Everyone noticed a slight physical force pushing them back, as if they could actually feel the interference itself. It was most likely something they had never experienced before. Ordo and Garhul suffered minor migraines from it, distracting them from their initial surveillance. Even the maggots squirming inside of Kapak’s chest felt a little of it. 

The camp, on the other hand, looked unchanged.~</span>

A Cepahlon split in two was nothing. There were always copies. But to Elo...that felt like he got his limb chopped off. The fact that he had to do so willingly only sprinkled more salt on the wound. And the fact that the wound was now infected with some sort infection was the cherry on top. While sparing most of the Spire&#39;s processing power to contain and repair the damage, he opened a private secured comm-link with Disruptis. 

&quot;Fathermucker...Dis, we have a problem. Connection lost and whatever it is that caused it - my software just went haywire. The bastarding byte got inside, I&#39;m containing the damage as we speak but until those on land find and disable whatever caused it I&#39;m not going back there. Also, next time we use Spire-made transmitter. With failsafes. Gonna set up an order with Sylvianna.&quot;

&quot;That was weird... no matter! Disruptis?&quot; he paused for a moment, frowning as he tried to listen for the end of Disruptis&#39; sentence, which never came.

The transference shaved a couple decibels off Disruptis’s hearing before frying the whole earpiece, causing sparks to leap into his ears.

“AAAAAAAGH!” He cried out in anguish, ripping it out. The operator’s face contorted in a flash of pain. He took a couple moments to walk it off and promptly slam a fist onto the planning table. It took a few more to get his bearings.

<em>What the muck was that?</em>

He regarded his broken comms unit in disbelief. That thing should’ve been perfectly fine against their scramblers. Either he had mucked something up in the development process or something changed. <em>Whatever,</em> he told himself, <em>I uploaded schematics to the Spire’s database, so they should be fine.</em>

He started to walk outside for some fresh air, but froze on his second step.

“Cephalon - good idea. Isa - no, we stick to the plan. Just stick the beacon onto the tower first. The drill should give us additional cover.”

Ivara summoned the bow into its hands once again, stretching from the huddled position into a proper firing position, observing the tower and pondering the distance and wind that an arrow would have to travel to reach it.

Isa gave a curt nod when asked if she was ready, then once Kapak seemed ready she bolted down toward her target, gaining momentum with a few steps before starting to slide. She assumed that Vuko would provide a cloaking arrow for them, and as such didn&#39;t order her kubrow to cloak himself and her just yet. He instead faithfully followed behind her, bounding along gracefully despite the pain in his head. If she doesn&#39;t get cloaked by him about halfway to their target she would order Ordo to cloak them both.</span>

The Nidus flashed one more grin before bounding down the slope after Isa, galloping on all fours like some kind of aberrated beast- a sure sign that Kapak&#39;s hunger was growing. Looks like the Nidus had been saving his appetite for this event.
The air was rank with smells- Ordo&#39;s skin cells, the grease of Grineer machinery, clone blood and sweat, dried out drahk dung, feather oil from condroc feathers... a delectable aroma to Kapak.
His stomach gurgled, and his bony armour quivered.</span>

The “net” held big enough holes to easily slip through, and seemed to have no alternate effects tapered on. It certainly wasn’t giving up its purpose to any visitor from mere inspection.

The large ballista tower they passed under showed no signs of stir. Anyone with a good eye could make out the sight of many Akklak, Morda, and Vruush turrets lining its inside and outside. They carefully swiveled around: relaxed, yet cautious. The station was armed to the teeth, and with no small amount of hands to work it. At least ten Grineer troops manned the upper platform, scraping the fresh-blown sand out of its armaments with old rags. They had probably been up there all day.

As for the base itself, it was as expected. Not one sole of a boot disturbed the night sands. All were crammed in buildings or burning the drill’s midnight oil.~</span>

“Mmmm (&gt;.&lt;).” Elo was forced to transmit with an MTU of five hundred. Five hundred was very low for cephalon standards, which told a tale in of itself. This made XerAI seem quite lethargic. 

The cephalon pulled her conversation partner’s user ID and tried to match it with something from what parts of her database that she still had access to. Her search failed.

Seeing as the whole thing was progressing at snails pace, he switched to the basest of his speech forms just to make it easier...for both of them.
&quot;Cephalon ELO. Designation: Main Cephalon of the Orokin R&amp;D Facility, codename Charred Spire. First encounter with Cephalon XerAi: Approximately 10 Solar Years ago. Reason: Meeting with Cephalon&#39;s designated Operator: Disruptis. You saved me.&quot;
<em>He took a pause, giving XerAi time to process the information provided. He couldn&#39;t just send in a scanning operation into her systems, it would be impolite. Maybe she was just waking up after a long period of inactivity? What was she doing there? Where even was that &quot;there&quot;?</em>
&quot;Was working with Disruptis on a mission. Lost contact 1 minute ago. Cause: Unknown interference. Attempts at reconnection: unsuccessful at all channels. Extrapolation: Disruptis lost all communication devices. Taking into consideration that he&#39;s not with you yet, nor attempted to contact me - conclusion: He is an idiot without any means of communications or transportation. Stranded. I possess information of his locations. Requesting a landing craft.&quot;</span>

The Nidus slithered across the sand and flecks of rust, carefully creeping like a kubrodon on the hunt over the smaller Grineer machinery.
Kapak paused at the base of the Ballista tower, leaning his invisible head upwards as if he could gaze at the Grineer through the floor.
He looked around, and saw the three cables supporting the tower. An unseen smile spread across his face.
“Vuko,” Kapak called one a hushed voice over the local comms, “you remember when we first met?”</span>

A couple engineers were working away on the various parts of the drill. Tiers of walkways surrounded some of the more vital components, but much of the workers seemed to be inside sheltered alcoves attached onto it.

Kapak could see that the cables supporting the structure seemed only necessary for holding down the mesh on top of it. This wasn’t an ordinary ballista tower. It had a much wider “pole” that looked big enough to hold rooms inside. It would probably take a little more to fell it than he initially expected.

The gentle desert breeze picked up. It grew quite strong, and started grabbing the sand off the ground and tossing it to knee-height in the air. At least the group didn’t have to worry about making small noises now with the wind screaming through their ears.~</span>

Kapak looked at the ground which he&#39;d covered, noticing his footprints. Quickly, he launched two long tendril from his thigh which struck the ground, wriggling quickly to displace sand and muddle the tracks.
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Kapak transmitted back, &quot;I already did! I ALWAYS make sure my tracks are covered!&quot;
Kapak ran his hands along the Ballista tower&#39;s base, lightly drumming his fingers to the beat of Cev&#39;s music. &quot;I just brought up the &#39;good &#39;ol times&#39; because... well, you remember how well that Ballista tower crumbled in response to your Void beam severing its cables. Although, this one looks a bit sturdier. Still no sound from Disruptis?&quot;
Kapak&#39;s fingers seized up suddenly, digging into the metal base of the tower. It was enough to create a decent sized deformity without compromising the tower&#39;s structural integrity.
His belly gurgled as his hunger grew.
<em>I should&#39;ve had a snack before we headed out,</em> he thought, <em>maybe there&#39;s some grokdrul nearby I can slurp up or something. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s something inside the base of this ballista tower!</em>
Kapak carefully inched his way around the base of the structure until he found something.</span>

XerAI was a sharp cephalon, and incredibly attune to emotional nuance. She needed to be for her operator, after all. She read into Elo’s sudden question and surmised that he was worried about her. 

<em>I appreciate the concern, Elo,</em> ^‿^ she internally processed.

 XerAI was only ever really in one place, but she and Disruptis decided that it should be mostly kept secret. This wasn’t an easy place to come to.

“Do not worry about me Elo, I am safe and well-protected. ^.^ I will rest and recuperate myself.”</span>

She paused as she watch Kapak start digging into the base of the tower before making his way to the door. The only response from Vuko was a playful jab. It seemed like they were going in after all. She crept along the tower beside Kapak, waiting for him to go in first. She would follow up to make sure they were able to quickly dispatch any opposition. Thankfully the windstorm would cover their tracks and likely any noise of battle, provided there weren&#39;t any gunshots.</span>

They sat in harnesses suspended from the top of the drill’s roof. Other than that, there were three alcoves he could make out. One had a flashing light inside, like the sparking of a welder, while the others held consistent luminescence. No one was moving outside amidst the clouds of dust rising from the ground.

<em>CHINK.</em> The door clunked open, welcoming all the airborne sand into its recesses. The inside was mostly a storage unit, holding munitions for the many arms that blanketed the tower. Directly across the room was a gigantic monitor attached to the wall. It’s dull-yellow screen shone on a Grineer ballista trooper sitting on a chair right in front of it, working away. She hadn’t moved when the door opened. To the right was a ladder leading to a closed access hatch to the floor above.~</span>

He crawled across the floor, silently creeping forward until he was right behind her back.

He opens the &quot;dusty&quot; channel gateway, connecting himself to the space-station somewhere in the Origin System.

Agh Tok squinted her eyes at the warm, yellow screen in front of her. Every thirty minutes she wrote a survey report and sent it off to command. Her vat-sister Kek Tok would review it and send her back an acknowledgement, or request further information. This is the way it had been her entire post, unless a monster of the desert actually managed to attack the net. She was about to send her another report.

But she had still yet to hear back from the last one.

Protocol is protocol, though. Agh Tok shoved the thought out of her mind and slammed an armoured finger on send. If they didn’t respond to the next one, she’d give them a call.

Or not.

~Kapak’s maneuver easily succeeded, catching the ballista by surprise. Her fight or flight response couldn’t even kick in before Kapak executed a deadly squeeze, crushing the plating on her neck and strangling her.~</span>

&quot;I do. Hello there, Active, nice to hear from you again.&quot;- he sent over, being nice to the young one.
Elo was the last Cephalon he would expect to experience memory problems. Everything was catalogued and hidden in his memory banks under close supervision of hundreds of thousands maintenance drones and other digital safety nets. Elo had to admit that he was going the paranoid way with his self-preservation. But everyone on the Spire understood that if he, the Core Cephalon of the entire facility, suffers even a minor fault - the whole thing might just go and kiss the sun. Literally.
&quot;I dont really know, he seemed like he was not in any immediate danger but...no one&#39;s gonna get him out of there. Unless the group that was with him decides to go back for some reason, he is effectively on his own with zero means of communication... So yeah, knowing him - its not good. At all. Better send someone in.&quot;</span>

With his other hand, he gripped the shoulder of the Ballista, pulling hard to separate the head from the body. He tossed the head to the side before beginning to slurp up the innards from the Grineer&#39;s gaping wound.
&quot;Ohhhh... I needed this.&quot; Kapak hummed with pleasure in between bloody bites. Once he&#39;d eaten his fill, he tossed the body to the side and remained in place, watching the door so that Isa could investigate the rest of the structure without anyone sneaking up.</span>

With the Ballista dealt with, Isa climbed down from the ladder. Kapak had been quiet enough to not alert the ones up top it seemed.
&quot;Finished? We should move on. Our priority is taking out their communications.&quot;
She took a brief look around. Since they were here it wouldn&#39;t hurt to survey the inside of the tower quickly. Hopefully no one manning the top of the tower would come in any time soon to. Still, to be a bit safer she walked up to the discarded body of the ballista and picked it up, carrying it over to wherever the best spot was to hide it, then put it down, keeping her hands on it a moment and channeling her frame&#39;s corrosive abilities, quickly dissolving the corpse. Hopefully if anyone came in they wouldn&#39;t worry about the missing ballista.</span>

“That does sound pretty bad,” Active agreed, immediately clustering a new process to pull together something to save her employer. She wrote up a letter concerning the details and shot it off to resources with the number 73 in the header tag, referencing the ‘retrieve Disruptis again’ request category.

<em>Those idiots in resources better pay more attention to my messages. This would be a bad day to ignore me,</em> she thought with a smirk.

Vuko’s arrow gave a small <em>pink</em> as it wedged itself into the pole. The Grineer engineer jumped in fright. To him that sound was either something breaking inside the drill, which would mean more work, or it was the sound of something far sinister. The latter proved true when he whipped around just in time to see a hulking Ivara jab him with another arrow.

His body spasmed, but the Grineer’s flight or fight didn’t have enough time to kick in before he nodded off. The cutter he had been holding fell from his hand as Vuko threw his limp body down to the waiting Cev.~</span>

The building was a metal construct built to protect against the harsh desert weather like that of what wreathed itself around their bodies that night. Warm light dimly glowed from behind a series of thick windows about two meters off the ground, but on the west side of the building there was nothing but wall, obscuring them from any other prying eyes. The worker’s heavy eyelids twitched as he started to rouse just as Cev leaned him against the wall.

The desert wind continued ferociously around them.~</span>

“Uh… T-tenno sko--,” he clambered for words, spitting out a mouthful of sand that had made its way into his mouth from the torrential sandstorm. He recognized the situation he was in, and silently thanked the Kweens that he had to learn a bit of Orokin to fill his job description. In somewhat broken and unpracticed Orokin, he responded.

“B-big boss is Gow. He in big building with bigger boss Mok.”

The Grineer was practically shaking with fear.</span>

On the way there, he got Isa&#39;s message and responded. &quot;Understood. Isa, you can start laying the explosives. I know you have some even though I told you not to bring any.&quot; He finished in a joking voice. &quot;Detonate on my signal.&quot;</span>

Apart from that she found a single reading indicating the possibility of rain soon.~</span>

Vuko and Cev made their way around to the south side of the biggest building they could see. Visibility was so low at this point that the tops of the drill and antenna disappeared into a sandy hue. The moon and starlight that previously had well illuminated the night struggled to provide anything more than a dim light now.

There was a single entrance in the form of a large door on this side. Small windows that more resembled port-holes fitted its outer walls. Three Arid grineer lancers sat amongst a series of large, black boxes about twenty meters away from it. Their backs were turned to the two Tenno as they watched the swirling sandstorm right outside the net.~</span>

Take some of the explosives and put them around key support structures for buildings. There should be enough to cripple this base.&quot;
With that she headed for the top of the tower, sword in hand to take out the sharpshooters. Once that was done she would handle the demolition of this tower before moving onto other buildings.</span>

While Grineer Ballistas could at times be quite deadly, they were of course snipers. Close range combat was far from their forte, and Isa demonstrated such with ease as she burst forth from the hatch onto the roof, as she fell down from her jump she cleaved the head off of one of them before leaping toward a second to make an upward slash, slicing up through her chest and throat, not bisecting her, but certainly killing her with that swing. The remaining two had turned to face her as she moved in on her third victim. This time the sentient blade swung high, cutting the sniper&#39;s throat, Isa spinning and crouching down on the follow-through of her swing to turn and face the final Grineer. With a push of her leading foot she gave one more leap forward and gave this one a cleave clean through the chest. She collided with the upper half of the ballista, kicking it into the netting around the top of the tower, using it to slow herself enough that she was able to land on the tower rather than leaping off of it. She took one quick look around and then seeing no more hostiles in the immediate vicinity she speaks over the comms. &quot;Ballista tower cleared.&quot;</span>

The full drill soon emerged into her view. It stood silent and sullen, a mood that matched the relatively soundless night amidst the desert ambience. Only a very faint whirring and clicking came from the drill’s small, distant mechanisms. Isa’s vision failed to capture anything past the back half of the other buildings flanking the encampment on all sides, one of them Cev and Vuko supposedly snuck off to. It was eerily quiet.

For a split-second, Isa felt something move beneath her feet. Before she had a chance to react, something burst from the sands and pounced on her, knocking her to the ground and pinning her with an incredible strength she couldn’t match.

Isa found herself face-to-face with a humanoid creature resembling a woman with an hourglass figure whose body was formed of infestation and bits of chitin. On her back sat a large abdomen with six deadly spider-like appendages. Her face, lacking all features except two luminescent cyan eyes, came close to Isa’s, as if inspecting her.~</span>

<strong>???:</strong>
“I believed the Disruptis was the only one who would think to embellish such a gaudy colour onto a warframe,” a high-pitched, raspy voice reverberated through Isa’s very mind, “apparently not. But don’t act oblivious with me now, I know you are with him.”

The only facial expressions the infested woman could make were to do with her eyes, making it usually very difficult to get a read on her. Isa could clearly see the upturned eyes converting an invisible smile, however.

“Oh? You misunderstand. I’m not allowing you to leave your warframe any time soon.”

A hollow rattling noise started from inside the abdomen-like part of her anatomy, and a field of nullification energy spread over the Saryn, sealing not only her warframe powers, but her ability to use or cut transference.

“I’m not disclosing my plans for him here. He’s too crafty for that. I will, however, indulge your curiosity if it means I finish here sooner. I am the Weaver. Disruptis and I go way back, and he’s been quite the mischievous child as of late.”</span>

“I was afraid I might need a hostage to draw him out, looks like that is the case after all,” she murmured.

~Isa watched as a small blue light flashed in the distance for a second, then the sound of an opticor being discharged blasted through the sandy air, along with an accompanying beam placed right in the Weaver’s back. <em><strong>KABOOM</strong></em>. The shield around her flickered again in an attempt to block the blow, which it managed in mostly succeeding before it shattered.

The Weaver flung Isa to the side, freeing her from the nullification, and turned to the source of the blast to find three grenades a split-second from hitting her face. Her appendages flew out and skewered each one, rendering them useless.

When the dust settled, a black and yellow limbo armed to the teeth was standing a couple meters away from them, charging another shot from his opticor.~

<strong>Weaver</strong>:
The Weaver flexed her talon-like hands. “Oh hello, Disruptis.”

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis stared the Weaver down.

“Hey, sis.”</span>

“What? It’s not the base of my operations, but that makes it even more surprising. I would’ve never imagined I would meet her here,” he shot back as he ran.

Disruptis led Isa to the other side of one of the buildings where a heavily armoured grineer transport vehicle was waiting. He leapt into the driver’s seat which was a mess of pre-jacked wires ready for hijacking. The Limbo ignited the engines and revved the engines.

“How much power do you have left for your warframe abilities, Isa?” He blurted.</span>

“Void, that’s a good boy,” Disruptis remarked before placing a hand on Isa’s stomach. With a familiar whooshing sound, the rift surrounded her once more. Disruptis then floored the pedal, and they lurched through the swirling sands.

“Ideally? Nowhere. Wasn’t even aware she was at a point where she cared about me. It’d make more sense if she tried to jump me in space during travel though, I don’t know why it was here. Or maybe that’s exactly why it was here. Dunno, she’s crafty.”

Their transport rocketed up the first dune. They didn’t have enough vision to tell how close the Weaver was to their tail, but that specter probably didn’t last long.

“Get ready, driving a big truck through this desert is going to get us some real bad attention, though we shouldn’t have to worry about sky-bound bogies with this sandstorm. I’m still recovering, so I can&#39;t use much of my power.”</span>

Normal comms can easily get fuzzed by them as well, but you had Elo. He should’ve been able to regulate your comms just fine so that they would work. My guess is Weaver did something sly to change that.”

Sure enough, as they left the base, Isa found her connection to the outside had come back up again.

“Probably originally a trap for me, but she didn’t know I was staying behind somehow. Something’s fishy. After I lost you guys, I had a bad feeling in my gut and followed. Almost got myself killed!”

Disruptis finished that sentence with a half-laugh, half-cough that devolved into a hacking cough. His hands fumbled at the wheel.

“I’m good though, you keep an eye out.”</span>

~As Disruptis was finishing his sentence, Isa saw a silhouette pull into view. A feline creature like the one she spotted near the exit of the Strait was chasing after their vehicle and gaining.

As it fell out of view, the transport flew over the crest of a dune, forcing Isa to grab hold of something as it smashed into the ground on the other side. Disruptis kept the pedal to the metal.

The sandstorm slowly thinned until the two Tenno regained most of their vision. They were now outrunning the storm by a slim margin. They approached the strait once again, and just when they thought they were scott free, a gigantic centipede slightly larger in width than the vehicle they drove bearing a steel carapace darted forth from the rolling sandcloud behind them. Atop its back, of course, rode the Weaver.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis caught the sight while glancing at a side-view mirror performed a massive double-take.

“UHHHH what in the muck is that?!” he exclaimed.

Disruptis thought he could see a glimpse of the awaiting landing craft on the far horizon. If they wanted to get out of here safely, they needed to at least slow their pursuers.

“Hey Isa! We gotta put some distance in between us and <em>that</em>. Any bright ideas?”</span>

Isa felt the momentary sensation of weightlessness that came with the car falling as it crested the dune. She leaned down and placed her hand on the roof and stuck to it using the same techniques Tenno often used to cling to walls.

She flicked the switch on her Zarr and fired a shot at it.

&quot;I will continue firing explosives. They may be distracted trying to avoid them. If the Waver isn&#39;t sustaining her nullification field, you could try banishing it and putting it into stasis.&quot;</span>

The overgrown centipede was hit on both sides, halting its momentum. It squirmed and screeched as rows and rows of teeth adapted to carving through the naturally occurring metal protection of the creatures in this desert drilled into it. The Weaver was flung off her ride and onto the sands.

That was the last thing Isa saw of the commotion before not long after, a worm toppled their ride as well. Disruptis was flung out of the driver’s seat for not wearing a seatbelt, and Isa was tossed to the sand with him. The Limbo tumbled until coming to a stop. With more delay than he’d like, Disruptis dug his elbows into the sand and brought himself to stand once again. They were less than 100 meters off from the landing craft. The end was finally in their sights.

Disruptis turned to make sure Isa got up. Before turning to sprint the remaining distance.~</span>

Still, she stood up and barked a command to her somewhat dazed kubrow who followed the Limbo after a second or two.

A lean, indiscriminate mound of black goop with a white mask that slowly dripped viscous liquid darkness into a cavity in place of the navigation module where it sat responded to his words.

Disruptis didn’t move. 

As his muscles relaxed, his mind absorbed the outcome he was now presented with. The problem with Kawamo had gotten no closer to being resolved. His friends were fractured and dissonant, and the first mission they went on ended up in three of them being killed, albeit not permanently. The mission still ended in utter failure, and did not manage to bolster any spirits. Yet another failure. It had been a long time since the Tenno had seen a measure of success in his life. He wasn’t ever one to be easily discouraged by any means--it was one of the things that made him stand out in the Old War--but even he could only take so much.

Oh yeah, and now Weaver was looking for him.

“Y-yeah,” Disruptis eventually blurted in a weakened tone, “let me take you to your orbiter, Isa. Where is it right now?”

The scimitar broke through Earth’s atmosphere and the yawning expanse of space enveloped the viewport. Disruptis lethargically sat up in the chair of his codex module to chart their course for Coal to use, only to find bitter tears running down his face. He put a hand to his face to wipe them but realized he was still in his warframe. He didn&#39;t fully understand why he was crying in the swamp of emotions that swam in his head, but it felt right. He let the tears run off his cheeks, helpless to stop them, and set about his task.</span>

Keeping his voice as stable as possible so as to not betray his emotion, Disruptis responded. 

“Lekalis? No, just you guys. I have no idea where that Strider is or what he’s up to.” He punched the coordinates in, then it hit him.

Shifting his attention to the conversation did well to distract Disruptis from his mind, so he kept indulging in it.

“Really? Yeah you should definitely get that checked out with Lekalis if you can. I could offer you some help but… the things I could do could come with terrible consequences. And given my current streak of success… yeah.”

Not that Disruptis was the same. Especially not with Weaver looking for him. These seemed to keep spiraling out of control.

Disruptis let out a long breath. He stiffly rose to his feet and walked to the left viewport.

“Weaver is a human from the Orokin era who was involved in a certain Void related accident. An actual one, not your typical Orokin ‘accident’. Ended up both infested and changed by the Void to some degree. You won’t have to worry about her though; she doesn’t care about you and there’s probably a thousand ways she can get at me without worrying about you, as long as you aren’t in her way.”

The Limbo paused for a moment, placing a balled fist on the reinforced glass pane.

“Either way I’m going to have to settle something with her.”</span>

&quot;I see. Well if you need assistance do expect to have to actually compensate me for my time if you call on me since you do not have any of the contacts I am seeking. Hopefully Kapak recovers soon. Keep me informed on whatever Sentient threat came to you during the assault on the tower. I am curious about it.

<em>Did you think I called you as a client and not an ally?</em> Disruptis completed the thought in his head, opting to cut himself off from speaking it. Isa could be hard to read, but here he had completely misunderstood her.

<em>Oh, the Remnant family didn’t mean anything to you Isa, did it? You just saw them as a means to an end.</em>

“Right,” Disruptis coughed, “I’ll let you know more about the Sentient if I find out more. I wouldn’t hold your breath for anything soon though, since I have to deal with the Weaver first. Unless the Weaver had ties to it.”

The Limbo clutched his head. “Oh muck that’d be bad, but also there’s no way she’d do that. I think.”</span>

That comment bit hard into Disruptis’s mind, digging its way to his very Oro. He shuddered for a moment and leaned into his own comms to try to respond to Kapak. 

“Hey Kappa are you okay? Hello?”

He waited a couple moments, but no response came. He cursed under his breath and turned back to Isa.

“Look. If trust with you is built off the back of success and not on someone’s character, I can’t say you’ll ever see me as an ally.”

If I was, what happened back on this very Exosphere would’ve never happened, and half my new friends would still be alive.

Disruptis bit his tongue and steeled his frustration. It wasn&#39;t even particularly aimed at Isa, but more at himself. He clenched his fists and drew a deep breath.

“Let me cut that expectation right now. I don’t know who you’ve met in your life that you model this after, but I can’t be them. I’m a mucking idiot that’s part of so much mucked up stuff I can’t keep my head straight, but if I had it any other way, I’d be dead. Maybe I <em>should</em> just be dead.”

&quot;Well... at least you admit your flaws. Work on improving them and know that I am still willing to work with you, for a fee. Both the Weaver and this Sentient have intrigued me. Send me the whole story to look over when you can. And remember, a fee need not be paid with credits. Many alternative goods and currencies exist in this system, I&#39;m sure we can work something out.&quot;
She gestured to her Kubrow who stood up and bounded down the ramp onto her orbiter.

&quot;And as for the point... there is none. None of us exist for a reason. It is up to you to make one for yourself. Keep in touch. Figure out what you want and I&#39;ll be around. You may be a magnet for misfortune, but you at least attract interesting misfortune.&quot;
She started to depart down the ramp, but would pause if Disruptis had anything else to say to her.</span>

Disruptis let his arms go limp. He hung there for a moment, not turning around to watch her leave.

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis collapsed onto the floor, scar pains still throbbing from all his activity. He stared listlessly at the ceiling of his landing craft, past the hanging cords and tubes. He lay there for a couple minutes, just thinking. The humming of the ship and the small splashes of Coal filled the silence in his ears.

“Coal,” he eventually uttered, “take me to the Pyre.”</span>
