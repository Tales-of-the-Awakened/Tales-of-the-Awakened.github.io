    <p class="c32"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">-Kapak&#39;s Orbiter-</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&lt;Sometime before the beginning of the story of the OR</span><span
            class="c5">&gt;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">The inside of the Orbiter was just the same as the landing craft, but thankfully
            the lights were much brighter. It was damp and warm, the air&#39;s moisture clinging to the Tenno&#39;s
            skin. The ship creaked and groaned, either from strain on the metal or some hidden creature growling in
            hunger. The golden spores continued to flit around the compartment, providing that almost whimsical feel to
            the otherwise nightmarish, living dungeon that the ship was. Through the masks, the Tenno could smell the
            air- it was not an unpleasantly stench-filled atmosphere, but rather a stale, mildewy feel that assaulted
            their nostrils. Each aspect of the ship seemed to be normal besides the swathes of infested growth that
            coated consoles and machinery alike.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">To the left, there was a stripped down modification station which was covered in
            little clay jars, each of them housing a miniature infested tree. To the right, the foundry, which was
            currently using some kind of stringy flesh to sew together what appeared to be some kind of Infested weapon.
            Instead of 3D printing the weapon using a resource synthesizer, three insect-like claws wove the meat-like
            material together like some kind of unholy tapestry.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">Further down, the Companion Modules: the glass done typically used for bathing
            pets in X-rays to preserve their genetic integrity was down, covered in a spiderweb of cracks. There was
            nothing inside except what looked like a disembodied heart beating by itself. On the other side, several
            inactive Djinn sentinels floated lazily around a column of light shining from the ceiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Take me to the infirmary, would you?&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">Kapak
            coughed to his Engineers. Together, the three stubby ape-like monsters helped Kapak awkwardly get down the
            ramp and slowly eased him across the Orbiter compartment. Without another word, he disappeared down the
            slope at the back of the main Orbiter compartment, and around a corner. There was the hissing sound of a
            door opening and closing, and then silence, leaving Vuko, Koya and Kuve standing at the edge of the Landing
            Craft&#39;s boarding ramp.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.h9zvx0wokl0w"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c17">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c7 c13"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c0">The lack
            of a rough stop threw him off, as he expected the Liset to halfway crash into the orbiter. The air
            didn&#39;t bother him much as all of his attention was focused on how surprised he is by how smoothly

            the equipment with curiosity, stopping by to look longer at the foundry, fascinated by the flesh-sewing

    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">The lights of the dark booth flickered on, bathing the walls in a bloodred light,
            revealing several holes in the wall, each resembling spray nozzles.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She descends into the addressed room behind Vuko with both arms holding his shoulders
            like he was some form of shield, and her face peeks above his right shoulder. She then releases the left
            shoulder of her companion and arranges her fingers on her left hand in the shape of a gun, resting the palm
            on the same shoulder.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;I am armed! No funny business&quot;, </span><span

            don&rsquo;t like infested tissue... or don&rsquo;t want to die intoxicated... that&rsquo;s gruesome.&quot;,

            class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;...that goes without mentioning we can actually see in here&quot;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.834eqf9rn5hr"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">As soon as Koya&#39;s foot crossed the threshold of the black room, the door
            slammed shut with a clang. The room began to fill with a a light coloured, bluish-grey smoke. The red light
            of the room flickered through the steam, casting a miasmic, nebulous purple storm to whip around
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">There was a ding, and a loud sucking sound as the gas was sucked back into the
            pipes, and the door opposite to where they had entered opened, revealing the Somatic Link.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">The room was polished clean, everything completely shining and spotless, without
            any sign of infestation. Well, except for the actual Somatic Link. It was covered in a cocoon of thick, wood
            like infestation that was often present in Orokin Derelicts. Behind the woody exterior, they could make out
            what appeared to be a much more fleshy, wet, pulsating chunk of meat, rhythmically beating as if it were an
            actual heart. Next to this mass of flesh stood another Engineer- or at least it seemed like one. This one
            was rather... obese. Its arms and legs were considerably fatter, and its torso was like that of a balloon.
            It was holding a metal tray in its arms- nothing was on it, however. It seemed like it was on standby for
            something. It did burble and wave at the trio.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">To the right of the group, was some kind of shower comprised of several metal
            bars set up to hold several opaque, white plastic sheets. Next to it was a Grineer water purifier, which was
            also very polished and painted to the point that it almost did not look like it was Grineer in
            origin.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">Next to the shower were several tables set up in the formation of a kitchenette.
            While it may have not been Orokin-level in terms of quality, all the appliances there were extremely well
            polished and neatly arranged.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">To the left of the group were 3 cots set up, each with a small Corpus bench next
            to it acting as some kind of nightstand. Again, everything was neat and tidy, displaying a strange level on
            cleanliness for what Koya had known Kapak to have (or at least consider clean).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">Finally, in the very center of the room, in front of the cocooned Somatic Link,
            in front of the 3 cots, and in front of the shower, was a convex, holographic display. It was currently
            displaying several pictures in a slideshow format- mostly Corpus businessmen in formal wear shaking each
            others&#39; hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>

    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">There were no spores floating through the air here. The fat Engineer waddled over
            like the fat thing he was, bowing its head while making some funny sounding, squishy noises. It held its
            metal tray out to the three, looking up to them as it did; it was only elbow height compared to them.</span>

            burst of white blinds him causes him to try to cover his eyes with his arm, but without much effect as the
            glass helmet is in the way. As his eyes accommodate, Vuko starts looking around. What catches his attention
            first is the cocoon.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Is he in that thing?&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He asks Koya, as he leans back to her, not breaking eye contact with the infested tissue. As his
            eyes shift to the fat creature Vuko thinks to himself:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c20 c23">Great. Another one of the infested whatever-they-are-supposed-to-be. Is he a..

            class="c0">Vuko takes the glass bubble under his arm and walks over to the slideshow.</span><span
            class="c5">&nbsp;- &ldquo;And what is this supposed to be? Are they... corpus?&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Whoa... fancy&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">the girl giggles as her eyes
            sparkle with curiosity and admiration for the arrangement of utensils, furniture, and overall decoration.
            Her eyes have not adjusted to the new lightning, and are barely able to make the silhouette of the shapes of
            nearby objects, but that does not stop her from bouncing from one place to another for a thorough inspection
            of each one. She slides, spins and jumps from one item to the next, gazing with delight at the marvelous
            work. Clearly not made by Orokin architects but regal and elegant nonetheless, and clean. Her parading
            continues for a while, and just when it seems than no immovable object would be able to stop her momentum,
            she comes to a halt in front of the small, round creature bowing its head.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;You&#39;re adorable. Imma call you Mr. Chubbs. You&#39;ll be my new best
            friend, yes?&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">she proposes with a grin and wide open eyes donning a light
            emerald hue due to the lightning; her torso is bent in a perfect ninety-degree angle with her legs, and her
            head is bowed just enough so her face is pointing at the thing directly. She does not seem to wait for the
            would-be-servant to respond, and instead proceeds to imitate its squishy noises as if trying to
            communicate.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Whoa... you&#39;ve really worked on this for some time, you twisted
            genius...&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">the soldier whispers to herself as she too gazes in awe at the
            presentation. While familiar with the work of the Nidus operator, it is clear there are enough new elements
            to provoke her surprise and spark her interest. The mirrored reflection of the blonde girl clearly does not
            share the latter&#39;s methods of exploration, and simply turns in her place just enough to get a general
            glimpse of the position of each piece of furniture; her lack of movement somehow hinting at the possibility
            of exhaustion or maybe fear of turning her back towards Vuko. Whatever the case may be, she too shows a
            genuine smile at her new potential residence, which is already significantly more hygienic than the previous
            dump she had to lived in during her spying on Mars, and apparent by her constant looking on her sister, she
            is glad the search is finally over.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0 c8"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;...Oh... that&#39;s... &quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">she attempts to
            explain before her sibling baptizes the thing with a Kubrow-esque puppy name and snickers at it. Kuve had
            always been the most creative out of the five when it came to jokes, randomness, and parties.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A laugh filled the room as the flesh within the wooden-like technocyte roots pulsated
            to the syllables of words.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Ha ha ha! Mr. Chubbs. I quite like that,&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">said Kapak&#39;s voice as the beating heat matched the words. The fat little Engineer
            grumbled before jumping in alarm as Vuko walked away. It followed Vuko, prodding his leg with his metal tray
            and pointing at Vuko&#39;s mask.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;He would like to take your mask,&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">Kapak spoke again,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;you having to carry that thing
            around would be quite unpleasant, I&#39;d imagine. Don&#39;t worry, Geth- I mean, Mr. Chubbs would be more
            than happy to hang them up on the wall for your ease of access later on.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c15">&#8669;Helminth:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">As Vuko watches the slideshow, an image of a shirtless, muscular Corpus wielding a
            Prova appears on screen as part of the slideshow, giving the middle finger to whoever was viewing. Abruptly,
            the image was replaced with Helminth&#39;s eye again.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6">-YES, VUKO DRAKKAINEN, THESE ARE CORPUS INDIVIDUALS, MOSTLY INVOLVED WITH A SOCIAL

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Ah, give it a rest Helminth, it&#39;s perfectly healthy to sit back and relax
            some time.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak gave a lighthearted chuckle. He was obviously very used to
            Helminth&#39;s banter.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;Ah, Koya, this must be quite the surprise for you,
            hmm? I&#39;m sorry for making you sleep in the infirmary- quite a dreadful place for a nap, in hindsight-
            but I figured you would appreciate this all the more, especially after we finally found your sister. I have
            stored extra cots in the storage container by the door, for if- I mean, for when we find your other
            siblings.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mr. Chubbs, obviously impatient, opened his strange mouth, grabbing the mask from
            Vuko before he could give it to him using a sticky extendable tongue. Obviously some manners couldn&#39;t be
            taught. He waddled back over to Kuve and Koya, thrusting the metal tray forward with a huff and a
            burble.</span></p>

            class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Damn! You really are inside of this thing. Are you stuck in there? - </span><span
            class="c0">He asked, after jumping a step back in surprise, missing the engineer by an inch with his
            foot.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;And what do you-&ldquo; - *He started saying to the chubby
            creature only to be interrupted halfway through by the appearing image of the cephalon.- &ldquo;You know
            Helminth, or whatever you are called, it would be nice if you didn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c28">shove
            your projection in my face every five seconds.</span><span class="c7">&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He
            complained, as the helmet was suddenly sucked out from under his arm. Vuko quickly turned around, facing the
            creature, his left hand venturing behind his back, where the dagger was hidden.</span><span
            class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;You little...&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">He said with spite in his voice.
            After giving the engineer a death stare, he let go of the blade, letting it rest in its sheath. He then
            proceeds to take of the odd backpack and put it down, leaning against the nearest wall.</span></p>

        </span><span class="c8 c0">the soldier reaffirms with a stern look; her eyes do not seem to be aiming at
            anything in particular, thus it is clear her mind is elsewhere. She takes a few moments before approaching
            the cot that is closest to the wall, and when she does, she uses her right palm to softly press against the
            area destined to support her body. It feels surprisingly comfortable, and the placid expectation of a good
            rest makes her immediately drowsy. She has always been the kind of person who is able to withstand
            exhaustion, hunger, and pain as long as her mind is kept away from the notion of a solution to these, but as
            soon as she is conscious of an existing opportunity to eradicate them, her determination and willpower break
            in an instant. Naturally, the stoic girl had been able to set aside her tiredness so far, but now? The piece
            of furniture in front of her is like a siren whose chanting is seducing her eyelids and muscles to stop
            moving.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Koya does not even try to resist the calling, and soon falls flat on the mattress

            girl comments as she removes the mask from her face and places it on the tray. She cuts herself short as
            some part of her seems to fade away, leaving her with a particular feeling she had completely forgotten
            about. It is comparable to when someone gets water in their ear, causing all sounds to be suddenly muffled,
            and there is not much that they can do about it. She feels as if her eyes were closed, her ears no longer
            listened as good as before, and her awareness has been significantly impaired. The Tenno tries to shake away
            the feeling by making an effort to open her eyes wider, and using her pinky to clean her ear from an
            invisible blockage of water, but none of these actions have an effect, leaving her confused and
            anxious.</span></p>

            began to swing its arms around violently as if hitting imaginary foes. It wasn&#39;t a very thorough

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;That last image before helminth decided to grace you with his lovely blood red

            behind the metal walls of the thing.</span></p>

            she is knocked back by the hasty motion of the vessel, though somehow the reaction sounds enthusiastic, and
            not fearful. She gets up as soon as she notices the round creature rolling away from her and tries in vain
            to run after it until it collides with the wall. The inexplicably cheerful Tenno hurries up to take it in
            her arms, and draws her lips close to it to confess something.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s
            him... He came for me! My prince!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She giggles throughout the second explosion with a gaze filled with expectation while
            tightening her embrace on Mr. Chubbs.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;I should&#39;ve wore something more
            elegant, don&#39;t you think? Or done something to my eyelashes, right?&quot;</span></p>

            second one confirms the severity of the situation. She slides off the mattress and runs towards the odd
            Somatic Link station as soon as she can, almost tripping on her way with her own sister.</span><span

            - </span><span class="c0">He exclaimed out loud, making it sound like it&rsquo;s Kapak&rsquo;s fault
            they&rsquo;ve been found. As soon as he finished saying that, the sudden shift of the vessel caused him to
            stumble backwards into a nearby wall, smacking his head into it with quite some force. Vuko slid down the
            wall onto the floor to a half-sitting position, white spots appearing in front of his eyes, blurring his
            vision.</span><span class="c7 c30">&nbsp;</span><span class="c20">I shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted

            idea in the first place, but I couldn&rsquo;t have denied her even the slightest chance it was really her
            sister. But it was. And she got us into this mess..... Crap. I&rsquo;ll need to find a way out of this, but
            for now I&rsquo;ll have to make sure this infested fool doesn&rsquo;t get us killed.</span><span
            class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c0">The flurry of thoughts quickly goes through his head as he

    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He chuckled nervously.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Weapons? What weapons?
            We&#39;re on a Tenno Orbiter, not an Orokin Destroyer. What, if I give you a Tiberon or an Opticor, you
            expect you can pierce the armour of a Balor class Fomorian? Man, get outta here. Or more accurately,
            HELMINTH, STEP ON IT.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c0">There was a shudder for a moment, and then the ship
            was still, and the sound of explosions and associated racket dissolved.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Well done,&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak&#39;s voiced sighed.</span><span
            class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;We sustained pretty heavy damage on the starboard side. Might not be able to fix it

            feasible way for them to follow us post punch. You can all relax now!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Mr. Chubbs burbled from Kuve&#39;s arms, as if scolding her choice in men. The
            fungal monkey furrowed its brow and lay limp as her arms were wrapped tight around him, preventing any
            movement.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;I&#39;ll be joining you soon, and hopefully Koya and I can answer any questions
            you have. Any and ALL questions. Oh, and Getha- I mean, Mr. Chubbs, do grab the Tenno some food would you?
            Hopefully we still have those cookies we made with the recipe Koya gave us.&quot; </span><span
            class="c8 c0">Mr. Chubbs wriggled free from Kuve&#39;s iron embrace and waddled across the floor, entering
            the kitchen-like area to rummage for the food.</span></p>

            landing craft thrust cuts her short. Her balance is severely affected by both her sleep grogginess and the
            motion of the spacecraft, but she manages to land on all fours with only minor scraping to her knees. Once
            she realizes the menace is away for good, she stands up and crosses her arm at the mention of baked sweets
            by Kapak, arching a brow at him in disapproval.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;She is an addict. You

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Coooooooookies!&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">the other sister yelled as
            she ran closely behind Mr. Chubbs with the clear intention to devour every good she encounters. She knows
            Koya&#39;s cooking skills are decent at best, but her recipes have always been something special.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.f3csrydij98j"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c17">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He slowly
            rose up from the ground, still a bit hazy from the blow to the head.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;-
            &ldquo;You better be right about losing them this time. I could use a little break.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c8 c0">With that, Vuko made his way towards the cots and sat down on the edge of the left-most bunk
            with a clear intention to loosen up, but whatever the reason, he couldn&rsquo;t. With something clearly on
            his mind, he watched the two sisters squabbling, a delicate smile forming on his now tired face.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.ipeibmlpaddj"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">The airlock to the room hissed as Kapak stepped into the room, bumping his head on
            the threshold as he passed out of it. Obviously he did not install the thing to his height. His teeth
            tightened into a grimace for a moment before standing up straight and relaxing his face into a skeletal
            smile as he watched Kuve excitedly pursue her prey.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">By the kitchen, Mr. Chubbs held a glass jar triumphantly over his head, filled to
            the brim with golden brown cookies, each harboring neat, evenly spaced chunks of a warm coloured, brown
            chocolate. The dust on the lid proved that it had been stored for a while, but as Mr. Chubbs unscrewed the
            lid for Kuve, her nostrils were hit with the delightful aroma of.... COOKIES. And good cookies at that. As
            Kuve would begin to hungrily devour them while Mr. Chubbs stood by her, awkwardly holding the jar before her
            like a loyal servant, her mouth was filled with the explosive deliciousness that only Koya&#39;s chocolate
            chip cookies could.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Ah, the child-like innocence so many of us have lost, huh, Vuko?&quot;
        </span><span class="c0">Kapak said jovially as he sat on the floor beside Vuko&#39;s cot, his massive torso
            still at his eye level. Kapak&#39;s body, while still rather twisted and grotesque, looked much more
            &#39;healthier,&#39; if you could say that. The lack of burned flesh, bullet holes, and chemical-withered
            meat hanging off of him was all gone, revealing a much tougher looking exterior of muscle and bone-like
            armour plating.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;I must say, thank you. There aren&#39;t many who are so
            quick to trust me, let alone help me. I do hate, HATE fire, but your quick thinking may have saved me
            today.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak scratched his head as he looked towards the wooden technocyte
            roots cocooning the Somatic Link.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Well, uh, saved me trouble at
            least.&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak smiled as he raised a hand, palm towards Vuko&#39;s
            face.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;You okay? You might have a minor concussion. Your cerebral
            metabolic rate for glucose seems to be rising by the scent of things.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He chuckles
            delicately seeing the Nidus hit his head.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Yeah, I miss that sometimes.
            Not having the burden of it all.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He answers in a calm and a bit scratchy
            voice as Kapak sits down beside him.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;On the other hand... I
            don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s healthy to hold onto it. Look at her.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">Vuko
            nods his head towards the cookie obsessed Kuve.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been
            through so much...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">As the topic
            of the conversation changes, after a few moments of silence, he once again responds to his
            comrade.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me. It was a purely tactical choice. With
            you unconscious or dead we would have a much harder time getting off Mars.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">He pauses for a moment and turns his gaze towards the Nidus, looking where his eyes should
            be.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Though in my profession you learn to be a quick judge of
            character. I think we&rsquo;ll get along just fine. Maybe with a few bumps along the way.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c8 c0">A smirk forms on Vuko&rsquo;s face as he says the last sentence. He holds out his
            left hand a bit in front him and snaps his fingers, causing a small, cerulean flame to dance at the tip of
            his fingers. It burns for a few seconds, shining an almost white light, only to be put out as the Tenno
            opens the palm of his hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">As Kapak
            inquires about his health, he answers a bit reluctantly.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I guess I did
            hit my heard quite hard during one of the maneuvers... but that&rsquo;s not what worries me.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c0">With that, he lightly pats his left shoulder.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;...Ah </span><span class="c7 c19">yes</span><span class="c7">... now these are
            good cookies. Not the best, no. But certainly good&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">the devourer of baked
            sweets assesses out loud while dexterously holding two cookies on each hand. Her cheeks are swollen from the
            tremendous bite she has just taken from one, and small crumbles fall periodically whenever her lips part.
            Her eyes are closed, as if trying to focus on the task at hand, though some movement behind her eyelids is
            quite visible. The decent taste cause her to recall memories previously hidden in those abandoned corners of
            her hyperactive mind, memories of the old times when life was simpler and plain, and yet, she feels none of
            the nostalgia, for she is happier living day by day.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;I&#39;m still surprised how in despite of our link anyone could tell Kayn cooks
            a lot better than you, you know?&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">she adds dryly before using her teeth to
            shred another significant part of a cookie. She then motions to Mr. Chubbs, as if silently asking if it
            wants some.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Cooking involves far more than just experience and/or recipes. Some people just
            have a certain magical touch that makes their food more delicious&quot;, </span><span class="c0">the sibling
            softly explains as she makes her way back to the cot; the rush of adrenaline which previously fueled her
            actions now replaced completely by the promise of a good rest on a spongy mattress. She is way too tired to
            argue with her sister, and it is true that she is not the best at the culinary arts, but that comment was
            certainly one hurtful burn which demands reprisal.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Others, as
        </span><span class="c19 c7">you</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;might attest, have the complete opposite effect:
            they turn whatever they touch into prison food.&quot;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.jict1opntwim"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">He smiled at Vuko&#39;s remarks, not minding the strong-headed Tenno one bit,
            although his smile faltered at the appearance of the fire.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">He glanced over Vuko&#39;s shoulder shoulder and lifted his finger, cautiously
            running a gobbled index finger over the posterior portion of his shoulder.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&quot;Is it in pain? Can you move your arms? Fortunately, from here it doesn&#39;t
            seem too serious, I can probably fix you up in a jiffy. Koya would be able to advocate for my, ah, medical
            care.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Kapak inspected Vuko, Mr. Chubbs continued to stare blankly forward while
            holding up the jar of cookies to the Tsarina of biscuits. It was impossible to tell what was running through
            the creature&#39;s mind, as it lacked pupils, eyelids and everything else that most creatures use to express
            themselves. Even when offered some cookie, the infested monster seemed indifferent, its long, horizontal
            mouth remaining partially open, his body still, other than turning himself in Koya&#39;s direction and
            holding out the cookies to her.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.sns764bh067u"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">As Kapak runs his finger of the shoulder, he will find that there is a hard bump,
            about 3 centimeters down from where the shoulder ring should have ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>

            pressing the sides of the pillow behind her nape; she does not bother with removing her footwear, and simply
            raises her feet and lets them fall dead on the mattress with a spongy thud. After shimmying her way into
            that sweet resting position deemed perfect by her backbone, she closes her eyes and sighs before
            adding:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;...if you&#39;re into tentacles and viscous liquids, that
            is...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The childish Tenno stops eating for a few seconds to scan the features of the small
            creature posing as a waiter, leaving the hand that is holding the cookie frozen in midair in front of Mr.
            Chubbs. Its distorted design amuses her, for it is fairly adorable in despite of its distorted factions and
            rough appearance. The sight is enough to make her visualize herself in a similar shape and condition: small,
            chubby, misshaped, and communicating with guttural noises. This image sticks in her mind as she giggles and
            forcibly introduces the baked sweet into the tiny waiter&#39;s mouth, clearly misunderstanding its body
            language.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;Here!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.6nf9bdsovddv"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Without hesitation, Kapak grabbed Vuko&rsquo;s arms, twisting and pushing until
            there was a sudden, jarring pop. He leaned back on his heels, staying at eye level with the Tenno as he
            laughed and raised his hands, glancing towards Koya.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Look at that! No &lsquo;icky tentacles&rsquo; required! You just had a little
            bit of a dislocation, I just reset it.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">He tilted his head a little and
            grimaced.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh dear... where are my manners? I should have offered you
            some painkillers before doing that. Er, would you like some now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In the meantime, Mr. Chubbs&rsquo; eyes seemed to bulge outwards even more than they
            already did as the cookie entered its slot-like maw. As it&rsquo;s leathery lips closed over the baked
            treat, there was a brief crunching sound before the squat little thing spat it out onto the floor in a slimy
            pile of goo.*</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;My Engineers don&rsquo;t like much other than meat, darling. They descended
            from a strictly predatory, carnivorous Hunter.&rdquo; </span><span class="c8 c0">Kapak called from across
            the room before turning his attention back to Vuko.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c18" id="h.xpmw1ipq8m8p"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c17">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He grunts as
            Kapak twists his arm, and with the &lsquo;pop&rsquo; Vuko almost screams, covering it with the loudest of
            grunts as he clenches his fist with part of the bedding in his hand, trying to withstand the pain by
            redirecting it elsewhere.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c0">He says quietly and without any bass, like he was holding his breath during the
            sentence. After a few moments have gone by he adds.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;The worst has
            passed. Thanks for fixing me up.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">With that Vuko pats Kapak&rsquo;s shoulder
            with his good arm.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t mind I would really like a
            bit of rest now.&rdquo; &nbsp;- </span><span class="c0">As he finishes saying that, he begins taking off his
            suit, starting with the heavy duty shoes, revealing a &nbsp;layer of black, tight-fitting clothes. After
            piling parts of his suit next to the bunk neatly he lays down, wanting to rest.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.3ma2jfqgu0wv"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Oh... really...?&quot;, </span><span class="c0">expresses the playful girl with
            disappointment while looking up and down at the odd concierge and its reaction, and discreetly sliding her
            feet away from the pile of goo. She frowns for a brief moment before her eyes open wide and seem to shine
            brilliantly with a new idea. All of a sudden, her free hand quickly grabs a cookie from the jar which she
            once again shoves into the creature&#39;s mouth.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;Time to evolve, Mr.
            Chubbs. You can&#39;t go extinct on me, buddy!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Your disregard for basic genetics offends me beyond measure&quot;, </span><span
            class="c0">responds her sister in a tired voice as she weakly slides off the pillow behind her head and
            positions it in front of her face to dull the external sounds. She wants to continue criticizing her
            sister&#39;s ignorance before she remembers that it is not the lack of information what makes her statements
            silly and comical, but her own negligence for all the data shared through their link.</span><span
            class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;...but yeah... Kapak... you too need to evolve into something less ugly...
            hah...&quot;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.brkuo6jo5dki"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">He tried to smile warmly at Vuko as he lay down to relax. Gratitude from his help
            was something Kapak always appreciated. He stood up and walked across the room to Kuve and Mr.
            Chubbs.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Oh dear. I&rsquo;m afraid that evolution doesn&rsquo;t quite work that way,
            Kuve.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">Mr. Chubbs proceeded to spew out the cookie once again in a wet bolus as Kapak
            couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. He turned towards Koya, and whipped his imaginary hair, even though she
            wasn&rsquo;t watching.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&ldquo;What are you on about? I am GORGEOUS. Helminth told me so!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.ph2jp6wa19pg"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c17">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Vuko, who is
            now laying on the bed in a half-sitting position with his legs crossed, laughs at Kapak&rsquo;s vision of
            his own beauty.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil your self-esteem, but I
            don&rsquo;t think Helminth is the most reliable standard for beauty.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c8 c0">He
            says while still laughing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He then turns
            his head to Koya, and says, still in a cheerful tone.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
            surprised, you, of all people, seem to have forgotten how annoying she can be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.lu96o5twct6t"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;You don&#39;t really know how long you and her have been gone for... do
            you?&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">she replies to Vuko while arching an eyebrow before her tone of voice
            adopts a particular somber quality as it becomes slightly hoarser, and her eyes seem to reflect a certain
            grief.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;I had partly accepted never seeing her again. Forgetting traits such as this
            was perhaps the healthiest thing to do... but I digress...&quot;, </span><span class="c8 c0">she concludes
            as she closes her eyes and rests her head back on the pillow.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c16">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;All you need is several layers of make-up, and a wig... and a good lipstick,
            for sure&quot;, </span><span class="c0">the blonde girl whispers while her eyes scan her host up and down,
            frowning as she performs a rigorous assessment of its facial features; or rather, lack thereof. The playful
            Tenno likes a challenge when it comes to beautifying Warframes through different colours and attachments,
            but this individual certainly look like a hopeless case.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.kh58sant2wwo"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Pah! You&#39;re just jealous!&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak scoffed with
            mock insult. He sat on the floor, and stared at the display in the middle of the room. An image of the
            Orbiter popped up, an area on the side of it highlighted in red.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Void
            curses and harrowed blood,&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak swore,</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;We
            took quite the hit on the broadside. Thankfully just from a standard battery. If we&#39;d been hit by the
            Fomorian Eye...&quot; </span><span class="c0">Kapak shuddered, turning towards Vuko.</span><span
            class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;Imagine a weapon that could destroy an entire Orokin Tower in one fell swoop.*</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Vuko was left to his imagination, Kapak stood up and dusted himself
            off.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&quot;Is there anything else I can get you guys?&quot; </span><span
            class="c0">He asked the trio,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;ll be a while before we get to our
            next destination. Hopefully quickly too- I would like to set this tin can down sooner than later and get it
            patched up.&quot;</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.62jk298esjsi"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c17">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Kapak&rsquo;s
            words, however unimaginable destruction were supposed to create in Vuko&rsquo;s imagination seemed to have
            little to no effect, instead just making him smile delicately.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I think
            we are all good here, right ladies?&rdquo; - </span><span class="c0">He answers seemingly for all of
            them.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- &ldquo;You however really should pilot. I would prefer not to a crash
            in an infested &lsquo;tin can&rsquo; or however you call this flying brick.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c0">While saying the last words Vuko was already laying on the bed with eyes closed and hands behind
            his head, preparing to doze off.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.sc174p99if34"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">By the time Vuko replies to the host&#39;s question, Koya is already lying
            motionless on the bed with a pillow placed on top of her face to muffle external sounds; if it was not for a
            barely audible exhalation every so often, anyone could mistake her for a corpse. Her sister, whose cheeks
            appear to be swollen due to several large chunks of cookies she tried to eat all at once, simply nods at the
            question while pressing both arms against her chest like a squirrel.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.bcu6gdj507lu"><span class="c5"></span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c14">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Well, alright then. You&rsquo;re welcome to leave this room at any time, by
            the way. Just remember to take off the masks hanging by the wall over there before you step through the
            airlock.&rdquo; </span><span class="c8 c0">Kapak turned to walk away, but paused as he turned back to the
            group.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Ge- I mean, Mr. Chubbs, take care of them, eh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c8 c0">The fat monster nodded it&#39;s bubbly head up and down and wobbled back and forth
            on its heels, letting out a compliant burble.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak looked wearily from the Engineer, to Koya, and lastly to the ancient technocyte
            roots at the back of the room. He gave the group a warm smile and disappeared into the airlock.</span></p>
