The survivors, grieving as they will, had mostly split off and separated their ways. Some drowning themselves in drink, debt, and other addictions. But fate couldn’t let go of such valuable assets, not yet. Just when the past seemed buried with the dead, the dead spoke. 

A message was sent out to anyone who could find it, using a secretive Remnant cypher and broadcasting from a nostalgic location upon Lua. Some managed to heed its call, some gathered others, and some even more failed to shake off the bonds of death.

The man in the yellow bowler hat. Now I’m sure you have many questions and… oH, ISA PLEASE DON’T SHUT THIS OFF I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME OUT!!! I would’ve liked to have a reunion but I’ve got my hands tied behind my back, so I thought I’d kill to birds with one stone and ask you all to help me out as well. I don’t know for sure what... state you are all in at the moment but I’m treading on ice so thin I can see the sharks swimming below me. Something very important is being attacked, and everything’s going to the Void if I don’t do something about it. So… come. Please. I need your help again, Kapak. Ella. Lekalis. Kuve. Devros. Muro. Orokino. Vuko. M...Mataeru? Muck. I’ll explain everything slowly whe-- if, you get here. If you can spread the message to the others, that’d be great. I can’t contact any of you anymore, not even Cev, but I have another way to reach out to him. I kinda… lost my mailing addresses. It’s complicated. The coordinates are in this message, but you may need to keep checking them in case it changes. Hopefully I’ll see you soon.”</div>

Pink petals slowly drifted through the afternoon breeze.

The surface of a swirling river below caught them delicately at first, then violently churned them into its flowing current. The floating petals packed the air around the river, offering one of the most beautiful sights the entire Origin system could show. It was still very hot, but the dry air permitted shade of any sort to be very cool and comforting. 

People were taking advantage of the shadows too. Villagers, who lived upon the great islands between the massive stream for decades, if not centuries. Wooden bridges stretched far across the gap, connecting the civilization to its mainland. However, despite the lushness of the river banks, only a scorching desert lay beyond.

A gigantic ‘X’ lay in the yellow sand just outside a colony bridge. It was created with a few dozen, or dare I say even hundred, rolls of non reflective black tape, almost comically too. This was the designated spot for a reunion of not only the living but the dead as well, and it ecstatically awaited its recipients.</span>

As the ship passed over the spot, one might have been able to observe that the ship was in terrible condition- covered in dents, its hull warped and scratched, paint job flaking off so much that some pieces of colour floated down across the desert sand as if they were propaganda pamphlets. Another thing a keen-eyed observer may have been able to see was a shape drop from the botton of the craft.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
With a heavy thud, a massive ball of flesh crashed down next to the X, sending a spray of sand up into the air as its mass displaced the powdered rock. The figure stood up, inhaling the fresh earthen air, a grim expression on its nightmarish face.
Kapak, the Plague Doctor. Kapak,  the Deceiver.
He had some words for the sender of the message. But first, he needed to find him.
Kapak stomped through the sand towards the edge of the river, gazing inwards across the bridges. He plucked the Mutalist Cernos from his back and nocked one of its fleshy arrows, pushing aside branches and leaves to get a better look.
Holding a bow in his hands brought back memories. Memories of Vuko.... and Kuve.... memories of when he and his two friends were galavanting through the system, a time before that accursed Orokin Remnant.
Vuko had taught Kapak how to shoot one day when they had stopped on Venus for a drink break. Kapak has just freshly grown the Infested bow specifically to try and bond with the Tenno Vuko, who had told him that during the old days, he had been an Ivara user.
But those memories were as good as gone. Vuko was dead. Kuve was dead. And Disruptis had cheated death somehow.</span>

The object tumbled a moment, then stabilized and made an upward arc before turning and rocketing toward the marked area, flying high above the ground, gleaming as it caught the sun.~

Isa:
With the roar of her Odonata prime&#39;s rockets, colored in a similarly gaudy mixture of blue and gold to her Saryn, Isa sped toward the destination indicated by Disruptis&#39; coordinates, curious as to what this was all about. An ally thought dead suddenly making a return had piqued her interest.

She spotted a familiar figure on the shore, a Nidus used by another ally of hers. It seemed she would not be the only one to hail this call. She dove downward now briefly before her Odonata&#39;s wings reversed themselves, slowing her to a hover in front of the Nidus, her Saryn gleaming in the sunlight along with the trim of her Galatine Prime, Rubico, and Lex Prime.</span>

The Nidus spun around to face the Archwing-bound Tenno, his arrow drawn back.
&quot;WHO TH-&quot;
He paused as his eyes were blinded by the sunshining Saryn. But it wasn&#39;t enough to conceal who it was.
&quot;Isa? Oh thank void, I thought it was some freakish bounty hunter who&#39;d set a trap.&quot;
He lowered the bow and breathed.
&quot;Now come on down, I&#39;m trying to scout out this place- there&#39;s a whole village here! We&#39;ll sort out pleasantries later, I just want to know where we are and who these people are! They&#39;re not part of the Ostron clades, they&#39;re too far away from the others.&quot;</span>

&quot;Absolutely.&quot;
Kapak couldn&#39;t lie, it was a little heartwarming to see and work with Isa once again. But also heartbreaking, as it brought up some sour memories.
There was a clicking noise as the comms connected.

⇝Helminth:
<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-ISA TEKCHEN. A PLEASURE TO SERVE YOU ALONGSIDE MY MASTER ONCE AGAIN. IT HAS BEEN MANY UNITS OF TIME SINCE LAST OUR DESTINIES HAVE CROSSED. DOES YOUR VILE DEMON STILL SPEW HELLFIRE?</div>

&quot;Oh for Void&#39;s sakes, Helminth, she did not mean to burn that portion of the ship when we were patching her up on the Orbiter.&quot; Kapak would have rolled his eyes if he had any.  &quot;Sorry Isa, you know how he is. At least you don&#39;t have to look at his eyeball now.&quot;
He waved his fingers towards the village.
&quot;Alright then. I&#39;ll start to move towards the village, as close as I can get. You be careful in the skies- they don&#39;t look like the kind of people with advanced antiair technology, but be cautionary anyways.&quot;</span>

With a sigh and a shake of his head, Kapak turned around and continued to move towards the edge of the river.
“Well, at least she’s not using an Elytron. Otherwise I’d be worried she’d firebomb this whole area.” Kapak muttered to himself.
He crawled through the flora until he was standing almost right on top of the River.
He strained his vision in the gleaming sun to try and see what was on and around the bridges he had spotted earlier.</span>

Heavily tanned villagers wrapped in thin cloths traveled about performing their various duties, of which Isa couldn’t quite make out. All their faces were obscured by what looked like… masks.~

~The sandy shores of the riverbank crunched beneath Kapak’s feet. Unfortunately, not a soul could be seen working this side of the river. Many bamboo constructs flanked the embankments, their contents deployed into the shimmering water below, obstructing them from view. Wooden pavilions mostly clear of overgrowth and packed with crates and strewn items dotted the landscape a little distance from the water. The bridge stretching a little off to the left was grounded into the riverbed via large pikes surrounded by massive stones, providing the structure with quite a load capacity.~</span>

&quot;It&#39;s.... clean.&quot; He said to himself, &quot;little to no microorganisms. No presence of Grineer biotoxins. What the Void kind of body of water is this flowing from?&quot; He stood up and eyed the underbelly of the bridge. Seems like it was sturdy enough to support a mutant Nidus climbing underneath of it.

&quot;And if they are armed and hostile, I doubt it would be well enough to take down my archwing before I can escape while letting loose a missile barrage.&quot;
She hovered in place, waiting for a response from Kapak as she continued to observe the villagers.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Hold on, my guest.” A hollow voice called out in sonorous tenor, disturbingly close behind the Nidus. 

~Amongst the dense vegetation just a couple steps out of his sight, a man leaned back against a tree. A sizeable mammalian skull engulfed his entire head, shining a beetle green in the small glimpses of penetrating sunlight. Antlers protruded from the top, decorated with leaves and a few vegetables. The stranger wore a thin, ornate tunic cut in the middle in order to expose his midriff to the pleasant breeze. A large farming scythe also rested against his right shoulder.~

~As Isa loitered in the air, popping noises could be heard from a variety of directions around her. The pink petals that strayed close enough to catch the flames of her burners seemed to be… engaging in miniature combustions.

Meanwhile, the villagers along the riverbank finally took notice of the airborne Tenno. At this distance, the masks on each of their faces were revealed to be skulls. They covered the entire head with some showing off small antlers and others, various beads and cloths hung from the back. 

Three of them stopped whatever they were doing with the bamboo constructs sunk into the flowing river and conversed with one another. Isa couldn’t hear them over the sound of the environment and her archwing. After a couple seconds, one ran off inland while the other two remained on the embankment and held a hand up to the Tenno.~</span>

She decided to try one last effort to break through these people&#39;s thick skulls, she spoke one last thing to Kapak: &quot;Apyo, kay pke jutykop to sitp.&quot; She then raised her rifle into the air, she fired off a shot into the sky, the sniper rifle&#39;s report echoing throughout the area. She spoke as she leveled her weapon back into a resting position, taking her finger away from the trigger. &quot;Stop groveling and answer me.

The man guiding Kapak froze, his head snapping to the source of the gunshot. He couldn’t see well over that much river, but the concern within him could not be disregarded. The man’s skull hid his worried expression.

“Um… yes,” he blinked, shaking himself to wariness, “anyway, as I was saying, we have prepared accomodations for your presence inside Kawamo.”

They arrived at one of the nearest pavilions. Crates lined the edges of the marble floor. Nets and various fishing equipment were strewn over the rail guards surrounding the entire structure. The man stopped in the middle of the circular floor and pointed upwards to a spot not visible from Kapak’s position.

“Do you mind retrieving that for me?”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Isa</span>
“They cannot bring themselves to face an angel, Tenno,” a voice called out from a few meters to the left bank of Isa. A women donning a beautiful matte, dark blue skull strolled up to the Saryn. Beads hanging down from along her small, white antlers clacked softly in the wind.

“Especially when your figure shines like one,” she added, offering a small bow. The villagers still trembled slightly at the sound of the gunshot.</span>

At the man&#39;s request, Kapak looked upwards and failed to see what the man was asking for.
&quot;Er, alright I guess,&quot; Kapak answered the man as he crouched downwards. With one fluid motion, he channeled Void energy through his twisted, fleshy legs, compressing  the air beneath him in order to propel himself upwards. A bullet jump maneuver, hopefully not too powerful as to knock the man down.
Upon landing, Kapak looked around to see what was there.
&quot;What is it exactly here you need?&quot;</span>

Folded and laying on the little storage cubby lining the inside of the pavillion’s roof was a dark blue tunic. The tunic looked massive, enough to cover even the modified Nidus from head to toe, even including a hood for his head. 

What was on top of the cloth would easily catch more attention. It was a large, white oval that curved inwards slightly and featured a strong band of some kind connecting either side at the back. A pair of grossly oversized gloves made from coarse fibers also sat beside the getup.</span>

A passing thought swept through his mind about how much damage the village seemed to suffer in the presence of Tenno. Not that they had much choice. 

He held out his arms towards the Tenno, trying to calm him down.

“Peace, peace! The villagers will grow very frightened by your appearance. They may start abandoning their posts to run for the other side of the river. We do not mean to distress,” he frantically explained.

The green skull was still dodging the real issue, of course. They didn’t want the people of the skull to lose trust in the Tsukait by bringing a warframe into the village. But, it’s not like they wanted any Tenno to realize that. Especially when they can often do… things just for the sake of defying others.</span>

&quot;Is this because I look like a walking corpse?&quot; Kapak asked. He was no stranger to the idea that he was one ugly fathermucker, but he was still suspicious.
Kapak allayed it though, and threw the cloak over himself. It did slightly impress Kapak that they managed to create something that could conceal his massive body.
&quot;There. I&#39;m not putting on those ridiculous gloves, or that white plate of a mask. Let&#39;s just go.&quot;
He was getting impatient. He just wanted to see if Disruptis was truly there.</span>

“Injured?” The blue skull repeated curiously, leaning forward and tilting her head. She froze for a couple moments in thought. 

“Ah yes, I see. You must be the one he told us about, right? Disruptis wishes you to meet him with your messenger, but if you absolutely cannot, then take to the skies once again to the other side of the river. On the right-most bridge there will be a man in a green skull waiting for you. He will make proper accommodations for you.”</span>

The green skull started towards the Nidus, then wavered. His hidden mouth quivered as another retort threatened to escape, but was eventually swallowed. He didn’t wish to push his luck.

“Very well,” the man declared, retrieving his staff off the nearby pillar and pounding the butt end once on the ground, “I shall lead you forwards. Keep your hood up.”

And with that, he lead the way back to the bridge.</span>

The blue skull paused. She hadn’t expected that. Disruptis had told them that messengers need not fear wounds, for any amount of gravity of injury simply heals quickly. What was this Tenno talking about? Perhaps she was merely trying to spite them. 

Disruptis had warned them about that too.

Fortunately, the Tsukaits technically did have a solution for this problem, even if it was indeed accidental coincidence. The Tenno had mentioned the true recipient of their costume had already met what sounded like Ivarill, so that meant Boonka was still waiting. It just so happened that the villagers had prepared more than one costume for the ‘one without a messenger’ and placed them at either ends of the river in case he had taken an alternate path. She have to wear the backup instead. While the blue skull decided the garment would be quite long on this Tenno, it was a good enough alternative.

But if another came without a messenger, there would be trouble.

“Oh,” the lady spoke up again, “My mistake, it’s true that your friend has met him. Your accommodation is to the left from here instead, on the other side of the river. Look for one of our white structures there and you will find a man with a purple skull. Please seek him, if you will.”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Kapak</span>
~Kapak followed the shiny green skull through the path and onto the bridge. The structure proved quite impressive, not budging an inch to his massive strides… in most places. The breeze felt pleasantly cool amidst the late afternoon sun. Sounds of the bubbling river caressed their ears. As they drew closer to the opposite shore, a flurry of pink petals quickly made their home on the Nidus’s cloak.~

“Ah yes,” the green skulled man spoke up after a period of silence, “you wished to learn about Kawamo? By your reaction, I assume your brother hasn’t informed you of our clan.”</span>

We hold stories from our ancestors, passed down to us. They enlighten us with a foggy view of our origins.”

The man held his scythe sideways as they walked. The blunt end of the sickle dragged lightly across the top of the handrail.

“We live as quietly as we can, barely interacting with the outside world. The grineer leave us alone: partially because of the treacherous sands and skies, partially because our lands hold no value to them. It’s not worth the risk enough for them… yet.”

The long bridge finally ended. Kapak’s feet met soft soil as they continued towards a stone path.

“We were largely blinded from the system’s squabbles here. That is, until you Tenno came. Your brother has been the largest supporter of Kawamo. He somehow solved our river’s slowly growing toxicity problem.”</span>

Kapak shrugged.
&quot;Bizarre that no outsiders have bothered you. Ever run into Ostrons? They&#39;re a northeast of here.&quot; Kapak gazed upon the desert lands beyond the oasis.

Boonka was sitting on the storage pavillion’s bench when fire descended upon him.

With a start, he scrambled up to a standing position as Isa detached from her archwing and hit the ground. The gentleman was as sharply-dressed as a villager could seem to get: with sleek, wellfitting black attire made of the same garments the others wore. His violet skull and antlers held immaculate symmetry in positioning. Everything about him seemed refined, even his surprised stance.

Except his name, of course.

The purple skull quickly made an effort to adjust his collar.</span>

The green skull hesitated. “We have... journeyers who meet with the Ostron and bring back tales of the splendor of Cetus. It is… difficult… for them to venture out, however. We do not wish to expose ourselves to the outside as much as possible, so picking up the tabikaiken is no small task.”

The two continued farther on the stone path. Villagers worked on various tasks around them. Some were busy planting crops, some were lugging fishing equipment around, some were idly chatting outside storehouses. Every single one of them wore a skull, save a couple of playful children that dashed across the path ahead who had on something closer to a mask.

Most took notice of the disguised Nidus, but none seemed suspicious of anything. One open-area pavillion complex the walked by held out-dated cloth-weaving technology, but the mechanisms were covered with bark, bamboo, and string wherever it seemed possible. 

“And as for your brother? My. He’s accomplished much goodness for our clan, but much crazy too. Keeps us quite safe. It’s a bittersweet thought: receiving the best of allies for the transition into the public world, but slowly losing the anonymity we once claimed. We knew we needed to deal with this in our time but…” he gave a tired sigh, “many hoped it otherwise.”

He paused for a second amidst a relatively secluded stretch of the path, hidden by dense bamboo trees on either side.

“But enough about sorrow, we are very glad to have another brother of Disruptis here, Tenno.”</span>

“Wow...” Kapak breathed as he observed the stalky trunks of the bamboo. “These plants still grow out in the wild? This place... this place is incredible!” Kapak reaches out and caressed the yellow-green wood.
“Before now, I thought the only place left in the system where these grow were in Tenno gardens, in dojos.”
Kapak shook his head.
“Remarkable! New Loka would flip if they found out about this place! This makes their Silver Grove look like a joke!”
He cleared his throat and turned to face the man.
“Would you mind if I took a sample? Then we can continue on our way,” Kapak inquired, shuffling his foot.</span>

 The purple skull opened his mouth in response, but uttered nothing. Perhaps Disruptis had made some… miscalculations on this size of his guests. He let his mouth hand for a couple more seconds then shrugged and gave a light bow.

“Of course, it’s a pleasure to have your presence in our village. I hope you were able to find us without any problems?” the man asked. He lunged two steps into the pavillion as he listened for a reply, drawing near a thoroughly pressed blue garment that lay sprawled flat across a large crate. The purple skull picked it up daintily.


<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Kapak</span>
“U-um. I suppose so,” the green skull stammered in reply. The man wasn’t certain whether that was a good idea or not, but figured they were giving up their privacy anyway. 

<em>Caw!</em>

The strident sound reached Kapak as he turned back around. Behind the green skull, and a few meters up, there was a crow hanging onto a bamboo stalk like a woodpecker to a tree, with its claws imbedded into the plant.

<em>Caw! Caw!</em>

It sounded once again, this time even more metallic and distorted than before. Upon closer inspection the Nidus could notice that it is not a living, breathing creature, but instead a mechanical construct.

The bird seemed to be observing him. It’s eyes like obsidian marbles, eager to plunge under the cover of the hood, eager to know more about the stranger in the cloak.</span>

He turned to the skull masked man and pointed at the empty branch.
&quot;What was that? It was a proxy, that&#39;s for sure. Surveillance?&quot; Kapak stepped forward, his heel dragging some weird fleshy tubercle out from the ground as he took a step.

“I am not sure… it is not ours,” the green skull replied with a hint of suspicion. After a few moments of staring into the distance, the villager readjusted his grip on his scythe and pounded the ground once with it. “Come, let us head to Disruptis quickly.”

Almost abruptly, the bamboo fell away to another shore. A much shorter bridge spanned the distance between this one and the next island over. The two crossed it in no time at all. 

“Hai, Dokutaa!” Kapak’s guide called out to a woman wearing a dark blue skull a little aways from the path they tread. She was gazing intently towards the water’s edge.

“Ah,” the lady responded, peeling her eyes away for a brief moment, “Ivarill, aisatsu!”

The exchange didn’t break their pace. The Nidus could easily notice the increased population density on this bigger island. Their walk took them past many structures with albeit a little outdated technology, but what really caught the eye was their placement and external design choices.

Kapak watched as a thick polymer curtain was pulled over a data-screen mounted to the wall, cleverly disguising it as a window. Children playing in the fields accidentally knocked over a wooden barrel, only to reveal a standard ferrite container nestled inside. All while the breeze continued to rain sheets of pink petals everywhere.

The finally, the green skull stopped in front of a large building featuring many traditional Tenno archways. It&#39;s red, wooden beams greatly contrasted with the surrounding environment.

“We have arrived. Take the outside hall to the left until you reach the second right. You’ll no doubt find him in one of the rooms.”</span>

“Not to worry, we’ve planned all this ahead of time,” the purple skull answered with a dismissal wave of the hand. “Dokutaa sent you though? Shimatta…”

The dandy man gave a couple raps to the pavillion banister in quick succession. <em>A shame, I was hoping to enjoy our tea time. That woman wins at everything.</em>

“Enough with that. If you would kindly follow me, we will depart,” the purple skull said, moving onto the path ahead and extending his arm towards further down it. “I will answer any questions you might have while we progress.”</span>

The Nidus wasted no time. With two massive strides, he crossed over the ground and stepped onto the porch, and with another two he moved through the sliding door- opening it and passing through in one swift motion. With that, he was inside.
Kapak boldly stepped through the halls, paying no heed to any decorations or hung art, nor did his gaze loiter on any others who he found within. He knew what- or rather, who, he was looking for.
Finally, he reached the door that had been described to him. He stopped in front of it and gripped its frame. He paused for a moment, everything becoming silent (besides the low creaking and cracking of door frame as Kapak&#39;s nervous grip crushed the wood). This was it, the moment of truth. If Disruptis was truly alive here, could there be more who also survived all those months ago?
Kapak flung the door sideways and barged into the room, his massive frame barely fitting through the door&#39;s.</span>

Kapak almost seemed to slide across the very floor at the speed that he reached. In the blink of an eye the towering mutant of a Warframe was directly in front of the Tenno, right arm outstretched. It lunged forward as if it were a Corpus Orb proxy, with the intent of closing around the Tenno&#39;s throat.

The smile on his face didn’t budge an inch.

“Ack-- hey-- ck-- Kap-ah…” he managed to squeeze out of his throat. Now close-up, the Nidus caught a good look at a large, new scar starting from the operator’s right cheek and disappearing down his neck. The blemish seemed to only accent his incredulous grin.</span>

Disruptis slid across the floor, scattering and tearing bits of paper before slamming his back into the tipped table. He grunted in pain with a face fixed in delirious laughter. Three chuckles escaped his lips.

“I--” he began, looking down at his arms. He imagined the long, white scars now lacing his body just underneath the seams. He imagined what made them. He imagined the time he’d missed.

Then, slamming his palms into his closed eye sockets, the Tenno drilled all his fingers into his face. His open smile twisted into gnashing of teeth.

“N-no,” his voice came again, shaky and broken. “H-how many in the end?”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Isa</span>
Boonka led Isa through the various sights of the Kawamo as they approached their destination. The buildings were mostly dedicated to manufacturing in the upper districts, so there was no shortage of various smith stations and ship factories. All of the newer technology was covered by dried grass, wood, and all sorts of natural items. Isa even walked by a miniature generator covered in flowers and vines. Thankfully, the walk had been uneventful.

Until someone called the out from behind.

“Boooo~nka!” yelled an energetic young girl approaching the two. She wore a white skull faintly brushed by a hint of pink. The mask included small, faded purple ram horns protruding out from the back in a circle.

“Ah, Sangata, I’ll--” the purple skull began to say before the girl sauntered over to the disguised Isa and cut him off.

“Who are you???” she blurted eagerly, addressing the Tenno.</span>

Kapak paused for a moment, regarding Disruptis&#39; mannerisms. The inquisitive Tenno had always seemed to have a screw loose, but now it seemed like something was actually up. He was definitely off.
&quot;Three... well, four now that you&#39;re alive again,&quot; Kapak grunted. He paced around the room, keeping his head turned towards the yellow suited Operator.
&quot;Isa, Cev, and myself. Everyone else... everyone else is dead.&quot; Kapak paused to pick up a piece of paper off the top of the desk as he paced by it, glancing at it out of curiosity.
He kept majority of his focus on Disruptis though.
&quot;That scar,&quot; Kapak said, pointing at the imperfection marring the Tenno, &quot;looks nasty. The Void happened? And you better explain everything. I want a damn good reason why you just-&quot; Kapak snapped his fingers- &quot;disappeared when we needed everyone the most.&quot;
Kapak&#39;s voice... quivered? It was uncharacteristic of the Nidus&#39; usual tough-guy act. His face didn&#39;t show any emotions though; it remained with a grimace plastered on his angry, crimson, bloated cherry of a head atop his shoulders.</span>

Isa&#39;s gaze wandered about the village as she was guided through the village. It seemed these people were slightly less primitive than they initially seemed, as she now spotted the well-hidden technology they used. Still, their worship of the Tenno was something that annoyed her. Her thoughts were disrupted  by the sudden arrival of a small girl addressing Boonka, and next her. She didn&#39;t hesitate to answer the girl.
&quot;My name is Iya.&quot;
She responded, her voice distorted as usual from the combination of speaking through her warframe and her voice being synthesized through her artificial larynx.
&quot;I am here to do some business with Boonka.&quot;</span>

Disruptis shifted his hands over his mouth, freeing the already red-stained eyes underneath. All of his repressed emotions came out at once as he failed to choke back a couple of tears.

“O-oh.. Void…” he muttered through a pained expression. The lump in his throat still swelled amidst the bitter sadness, desperately trying to contain a waterfall of sorrow. The Tenno didn’t even bother trying to answer Kapak’s other questions just yet, allowing himself a silent moment to breathe his grief.

~The paper Kapak had picked up seemed to be the layout of some sort of grineer structure. Various notes in Disruptis’s terrible handwriting were scrawled over various entrances, ramps, and what looked like devices. At a glance, the Nidus could pick out the biggest words on the page contained in a much more attractive circle: “Don’t touch the migraine modulators! You will be breakfast!”~</span>

“I already heard from Cev how it happened,” he finally spoke up in a somber and sullen tone, “I knew I should’ve had him break the news before this.”

The yellow Tenno hugged his knees tightly to his chest.</span>

The tribal gentleman paused to steal a glance at the robed warframe, his mind racing. “...here to see about supplying us some new generators. Now, you should head back to the task I know you left.” He finished with a shaming finger.

“I was on breaaak~~” the young girl complained. Of course, that was a white lie. Knowing her uncle would be able to see through it, she retreated off down the street.</span>

“No, I only got in touch with Cev yesterday. He couldn’t get a hold of you any faster than I could. But before I go explaining what’s been happening I think we should wait for others...” the sentence trailed off before Disruptis looked up at Kapak with a more hopeful expression.

&quot;Oh, Cev only showed up yesterday... uh.... well, I&#39;m still mad at you! I am furious! The only reason I&#39;m not slamming your yellow-suited body against the wall is because I want to know about whatever the Void&#39;s going on!&quot;
Kapak slumped onto the floor across from Disruptis, his massive body comically bumping things gently as he sat, and his weird cloak snagging on the desk&#39;s edges.
The Nidus emitted a sigh.
&quot;Yeah... Isa&#39;s coming. We split up to scope out this place,&quot; Kapak said as he yanked on his cape, trying to dislodge it from its entrapment, &quot;you must understand from my... past that there are a lot of people willing to go great lengths for my capture. It&#39;s been such a long time that Black Obsidian wants to raise my bounty by another 10k platinum. <em>Ityate suykety</em>.&quot;
With a final tug, the cape came free of the desk&#39;s corner.
&quot;You mentioned Cev told you things... did he tell you about...&quot; Kapak inhaled and spoke again, voice still shaky, &quot;...about what happened at the Grineer Fortress?&quot;</span>

Having been guided to the room by Boonka. Isa stepped inside now. Her Saryn still wearing the cloak and mask. Now out of sight from the villagers, she revealed her true self, appearing in front of the Nidus and other Tenno. Or at least it was likely her. She wore the same outfit, though with the hood up, concealing her face.

&quot;Ah, so the deserter has decided to reveal himself.&quot;

Her synthetic voice rings out, dripping with venom.

&quot;I see you&#39;ve made a nice little cult.&quot;

Something about the way she held her body seemed off. It was oddly tense, though not as though she was ready to attack. She seemed to instinctively be leaning somewhat to the right.</span>

Disruptis furrowed his brows in suspicion. “Cev shou--” 

The door slid open. Disruptis quickly wiped his wet face as best he could and twirled around just as the beautiful golden Saryn entered. Before the Tenno knew it, Isa was standing in front of him, in the flesh. Disruptis immediately perked up and shoved his melancholy tone further down his throat.

“Eyyyyy Isa!” He called out, leaning onto the overturned table with a beaming grin, “Just in time--”

<span class="pre pre--inline">&quot;I see you&#39;ve made a nice little cult.&quot;</span>

“Huh?” Disruptis blinked, “Oh. Ha! I know what you’re talking about. As much as I’d like to take credit, that was something the elders themselves cooked up and served to their people.”

He swung himself around the table and meandered up to one of his old partners. His arm stretched out to offer a firm handshake. 

“Good to see you again,” Disruptis spoke genuinely.</span>

She looked at Disruptis&#39;s hand for a moment, then her gaze moved back up to his face. Even behind the mask, one could sense the maliciousness of her gaze. The tension in her stance grew. It seemed now to be not just discomfort, but hostility. Flames began to sprout from her left arm, spreading over her body. The Void fire that she had been known to have a talent with seemed to burn even hotter than when she had previously ignited Kapak.

&quot;Not that I care particularly about that. You&#39;ve done <em>far worse</em>.&quot; Her voice dripped with venom as she spoke. It was rather clear that unless he was able to talk quickly or subdue her, there would be a fireball flying at his face in a few moments.</span>

The Nidus shifted uncomfortably and took a multitude of tiny steps back until he was practically against the far wall. The mutant Warframe’s sudden shift from bitterness has quickly given way to an unconcealed, overwhelming fear of the embers coiling through the fingers of the Corpusborn Tenno.
“Ummmm.... ummmm...” Kapak seemed like he was trying to say something but all that came out were groans and squeaky whimpers.”</span>

<em>No. No, no. No no no no nonononono…</em>

“I-Isa? Ho-hold on. Before you make any judgements, please listen to what I have to say. I know I seem like scum prime right now but I promise..” he pleaded in a fearful tone.

The Tenno dropped to his knees knit his fingers together, holding them out towards Isa in a begging position.

&quot;Fine... explain yourself.&quot;

She said, then reached down and took hold of him by the shirt with her fiery arm, the flames licking at it, singing it and him, probably. She would lift him up to his feet and shove him back a step or two.

&quot;And do it without groveling like a tipyk.&quot;</span>

“Oh… yeah,” Disruptis replied, doing a complete 180 from his pleading disposition and returning to his normal self. He quickly stroked a couple fingers across his cheeks to dissipate heat from the singed hairs, but mostly shrugged the damage off.

“So, I might as well start the full explanation now as I…” Disruptis stole a glance and the cowering Nidus, “...don’t think we’ll have anyone else.”

He sat down against the overturned table once again and clapped his hands together. “Now, a quick recap. As you guys know, we disable the solar rails and move the tower into earth’s orbit. Then Vay Hek comes out of nowhere with a fomorian and tears us a new one. But just as it shows up, I disconnect from my warframe.”

Disruptis lifted his hands in wide gestures to symbolize each component in an invisible diagram. “I… could’ve never imagined the fomorian would show up. I did, however, rig some general countermeasures in case we needed to protect the tower from… unexpected threats. Had them on Sanctuary too actually. Only problem is I need to flip the switch in person back on my orbiter.”

His hands fell down on his lap. “Honestly, I’m not sure what I was thinking. It was the only thing I knew how to do. I hoped it would do… something. Anything really. Might’ve kept the void anchor from going boom long enough to get everyone out, but it’s hard to tell for sure….”</span>

She formed  more of a claw with her left hand as the flames began to concentrate there.

“I was about to,” Disruptis replied, meeting where he thought Isa’s concealed eyes might be. Now that he thought about it, it was strange for her to be wearing the hood up anywhere outside of a lab environment. 

“Message you, that is. But someone was waiting for me on board. They jammed my transmissions right as I entered and near-fried my cephalon. If it hadn’t been for her special properties, XerAI would’ve been toast.”

The Tenno got up and started pacing a safe distance away from the fiery Isa. “I’m not even sure what hit me. It was dark and all happened too fast. I fought a creature with the power to destroy oro and the intellect to slice me open for it. My best theory to this day is that it was a more… sentient, sentient. I have no idea how it pulled a wool over XerAI’s receptors and got in, but it did.”

He sent another glance Kapak’s way and pointed to the new scarring on his face. “That’s how I got this by the way. Mucker just about tore me up before I flushed it into Venus’s stratosphere. It couldn’t fly I guess. It was a long time before I finally healed. Like, this long.”</span>

The flames stopped converging in Isa&#39;s hand now. Still, they flickered and danced across her arms and body. &quot;I see.&quot;
The suspicion in her voice was still quite audible.

&quot;So this sentient attacked you, you managed to dump it, then came... here? Did you not have the means to message before you were healed?&quot;

Still, there was a hint of something more in her voice. Hearing about some new, and previously unknown form of sentient piqued her interest. If Disruptis was just making something up to not be burned alive, he knew what strings to pull with Isa.</span>

The Nidus visibly relaxed, no longer pressing his entire body as deep into the wal as possible. Yet, the still-flickering flames over Isa were enough to keep him from walking towards them.
“A Sentient. Really.” Kapak’s voice called out incredulously.
“What, a Conculyst waltzed into you Orbiter and unplugged your Somatic Link or something? Come on, at least make your tale believable.”
Kapak harrumphed. “There’s no Sentients left in the System that you couldn’t possibly deal with by yourself, unless it was Hunhow himself who flipped the switch on you.”
Kapak raised his hand to cut off any explanation Disruptis would try to give.
“Just... continue with the story. Let’s see where this goes.”</span>

“That’s… right Kapak. The whole battle was kind of weird actually…” Disruptis let his sentence trail off into the air as he stood with a ponderous expression.

“But regardless, as I said Isa, the sentient toasted my cephalon’s… um… memory… kind of. She lost everything in her databanks short of her own personality and a few important details. That meant she lost your calling cards, and couldn’t safely contact you with another general broadcast without letting the enemies know right where we were.”

Disruptis scoffed. “Well, I’m sure <em>I</em> could’ve rigged something up if I wasn’t out like an LED for the following months. Didn’t really come to until about a month ago.”

“Oh wait,” he interrupted himself, only now properly processing his companion&#39;s words. “Oh no Isa sorry, I didn’t come here for healing. XerAI wouldn’t take that risk. I had a nice little hidden station outside of systemic orbit that I chilled in.”</span>

Now, feeling much better that the heat that had radiated from Isa had diminished by a significant amount, Kapak took another step forward, closer to the conversation.
&quot;Yeah, okay... assuming this..... <em>&quot;SENTIENT&quot;</em> is real, it is reasonable. But there are millions of other better-known safe spaces we could&#39;ve met at.

A smile crept back on to Disruptis’s face. His eyes begun to shine with his old glee, as if the Tenno had picked out the perfect present for his best friend and couldn’t wait to see their reaction.

“Oh, are we gonna get to the fun stuff now?” He returned to the overturned table. “You see, I have a <em>lot</em> to explain, and a <em>lot</em> to do. So I’m going to get both things done at once.”

Disruptis heaved the table back into its upright position and the readjusted the now slightly torn map.

“Welcome, to Kawamo,” he continued, waving his arms over the giant sheet of paper. It showed a picture of the river and surrounding area. “Home to less than five thousand authentic members of a unique people group. They’ve stayed largely under the radar for years, even dodging grineer attacks thanks to the deserts all around. As far as I know, I and two other unrelated people are the only Tenno to ever stumble across it.”

“Now unfortunately,” Disruptis pointed to a couple small drill symbols a good distance away from the river, “The grineer do enjoy mining the desert for resources, so they’ve squatted in the more safer zones. They’ve tried a lot of times to cross over, but by the time they make it their ranks are so thin they can dodge rain drops! Easy pickings! That’s how it used to be, at least. Word now is that they’re getting more and more successful; It might only be a matter of time before the Kawamo have to up their response-game. But, we’re not worried about that today.”

Disruptis spread his arms across the table and leaned down on his hands. “I told these guys I’d help them out in little ways. Just kind of the thing I do when I visit new colonies, really. They hit me up not long ago to help them deal with a situation with some of their kin being kidnapped by the grineer. That’s the first part of why I brought us here, because I wanted to see if you guys were willing to help me with that. Any questions so far?”</span>

Disruptis allowed himself a deep, internal sigh. <em>Yeah…</em>

“Yeah yeah, I know you guys don’t care about this kind of stuff, so I wouldn’t have called you here if it was just that. The second reason is because I don’t believe for a VOID DAMN second that a hunting group of these people were so easily plucked up and rolled away by just the grineer, even with their supposed ‘recent success’. Not near the river, at least.”

Disruptis performed a cursory sweep of the large traditional room and the halls outside as he spoke. Satisfied with whatever he found, he returned to the two and continued, this time in his fairly good Corpus.

“[Corpus] I have reason to believe there’s someone helping them. Someone powerful, and who’s trying to lure me out into the open. Naturally as I am still recovering, so I can’t let that happen. I’m safe here, but I don’t know if the moment I step outside I’m going to be turned into fertilizer for the desert plants.”

He turned and lost his sight in the beautiful view outside of the window. “I’m not sure exactly which enemy of mine it is, but I know that if we can investigate the interaction between them and the grineer, we may be able to trace them back. They may have some very good piece of tech that they’re using to stay alive in the desert, and that’s well worth our time. It might even be orokin, who knows? [/Corpus]”</span>

&quot;[Corpus] Disruptis... I... had no idea your brain was that smooth. You speak like desert survival requires some sort of powerful technology. Given two hours and a Corpus shopping catalogue I could acquire all the products I need to survive in a desert for a year, indefinitely if I were to find an underground source of water. Honestly anyone smarter than a Grineer butcher with a small amount of the proper modern technology can survive the desert with ease. If you honestly believe that the Grineer are incapable of crossing the desert to attack these villagers if they thought them worth the manpower and fuel, you&#39;re only fooling yourself.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen anything other than some ancient plants, but I did see a robot bird,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;but it was unlike any design I&#39;d ever seen. It wasn&#39;t a Corpus proxy, and it definitely wasn&#39;t crude enough to be Grineer.&quot;

Disruptis blinked at both of their responses. “Well muck, the odds of that happening were supposed to be very slim. I…” he gave a dry, incredulous laugh. “Well that’s gonna make this a little harder to explain. Just my luck too. Where to begin?”

Disruptis fully entrusted his weight to the table, taking the time to gaze into the air for a couple seconds. “So, first of all, Kapak. Don’t worry about what you saw. I’ll talk about that in a bit, but just know that isn’t from around here. Well, that is, if I do in fact know what you are referring to. Second, Isa. Actually truth be told, Kawamo isn’t exactly safe enough for comfort. The whole area sits inside an overlap of two flying beasts’ territories. On one hand you have the akuul, a type of...oh what’s the word...” he snapped his fingers repeatedly as shuffled through his memory, “chiroptera. Giant ones, powerful too. They hunt in small packs using echolocation to sweep the air for munchies. On the other hand, you’ve got the feezabii. Hardy avians who are even bigger and stronger than the akuul. They don’t usually hunt together, but if something attacks even one then you can bet your left somatic circuits that they’re all gonna swarm. Both these parties can go toe-to-toe with Tusk Bolkors. They both protect Kawamo from flying grineer, and keep it safe by gobbling up most large fish that wander down from the lake upriver.

Disruptis threw his arms open into a shrugging gesture. “Now, you’d <em>think</em> that they would wipe out the villagers too, but that’s strangely not the case. They both don’t touch animals on the grassy lands, and just about barely hunt land-bound creatures that aren’t the zillions of worms infesting the dunes. We only have a few theories as to why that is but it’s not something we’ve managed to figure out yet, so we can’t count on it being that way forever.”

As I said, there are millions of these worm-like creatures popping up and down from the surface. Some are big, some are small. They’re the main meat of most animals here, but still give a challenge to anyone travelling along the ground. Not to mention the <em>other</em> things that walk around on legs.”

He shivered. “But I’m getting off track. Point is: a lot of scary stuff roams around here. The grineer have tried their fair share of schemes in the past, but frankly, there’s just no real reason for them to send a gigantic assault. No natural resources, no access routes, no artifacts, no individuals who pose a threat. Just the many corpses of their lost ships.”

He ended the sentence with a couple taps on the tabletop. “Now, any other questions? I have some other stuff to show you that I guarantee you’re gonna like.”</span>

The Nidus pouted, grumpy as ever... but the mention of enormous creatures did interest him. If there&#39;s one thing that intrigued Kapak, it was harvesting genetic material from fascinating beasts.
&quot;Alright, just show us what&#39;s up,&quot; Kapak said, caving slightly due to his intrigue in this weird place. Something still seemed off, but all he could do was plow ahead.

Disruptis’s stare flattened on Isa. He had been around the corpus tenno for long enough to pick up on at least some of her tells, and it was clear she somehow wasn’t convinced. It wasn’t even his opinion, she just seemed to distrust his intel. A very peculiar bias, but he had grown rather used to it at this point. Isa wouldn’t be Isa without it. 

<em>Although, I wish she trusted me just a little,</em> Disruptis couldn’t help but admit.

“Wait Isa, are you alright?” he asked with a concerned frown, “you’ve been making some odd moves since you got here. What’s up?”</span>

&quot;Y’see, lady fortune wouldn’t let me be the only one to escape presumed death, that’d be kind of killing the hate-relationship we have. She had to balance the scales somehow.&quot;

The two sets of steps, while seeming out of tune, blend in wonderfully to announce the arrival of the last individuals Kapak and Isa would have expected to appear together: Vuko and Garhul

Dressed in a tunic simmilar to those of the natives, his skin a bit paler than usual that seem to add years to his youthful appearance, crow&#39;s feet under his eyes which deepen his light face, and his body appearing thinner than before from the slight loss of his muscle mass. He lifts his head to gaze at Kapak and Isa, a bright playful smile spreading across his face as he leans on the doorframe and crosses his arms over his chest.

<strong>Vuko</strong>

The kubrow appears a second after Vuko did, the towering beast slipping forth from the shadows to stand beside the leaning boy. Just like Vuko, the faithful kubrow is not as the same as before everything went to the shitter. His left ear is nowhere to be seen on his heavy head, as it was cut at the base months back, leaving a uneven gash on that side of his face that is now mostly covered up with his crimson coat. The fur around his left shoulder area is much thinner, which just barely covers the wrinkly scorched flesh beneath that stretches from his elbow all the way to the top of his shoulder. His bulkiness is less impressive than it once was but even without all of the muscles he still looks just as terrifying, if not familiar.

His dull golden eyes lit up as they land on Kapak and the large beast quickly springs towards the fleshy warframe, barking in all joyful tones as he basically throws himself at the Nidus for a powerful, yet loving, tackle.</span>

The Nidus was too stunned to register anything that came out of Disruptis&#39; mouth, or what came through that door. The next thing Kapak knew, he was lying on the floor with Kubrow slobber all over his face.
&quot;Whoa boy!&quot; Kapak began to giggle, something relatively uncharacteristic for the previously angry Nidus. But he could tell by the canine&#39;s scent immediately who it was. &quot;Garhul! Lemme up!&quot;
He pushed the excited Kubrow off of his chest and scratched at the behemoth&#39;s neck, the skeletal grin engraved onto the Warframe&#39;s skull growing into a beam.
He stood up and saw Vuko, and for the first time in a year, Kapak was... happy.
&quot;Vuko!&quot; Kapak laughed as he quickly closed the gap between him and the Tenno, but instead of choking him like he had to Disruptis, the Nidus wrapped his arms around the boy, lifting him into the air with his powerful embrace.
He set the Tenno down and rested a hand on his shoulder.
&quot;You&#39;re... alive! I thought... you were dead? I mean, all this time-&quot; he reached out and gave Garhul another ruffle. Kapak grabbed his thumb and tore it off, holding it high in the air for the Kubrow to reach for.
Kapak&#39;s smile faltered for a moment.
&quot;Devros... he... he didn&#39;t make it, did he?&quot;</span>

Isa barely moved as Garhul and Vuko entered the room. Her head turned to face them, but beyond that she stood with her arms crossed in the same position of discomfort as she had been.

&quot;Ah Vuko. It&#39;s good to see that you survived.&quot; She said, her voice lacking in emotion. She eyed Garhul for a moment, but didn&#39;t speak to the kubrow at all. Unfortunately it seemed his master was not as lucky as Disruptis or Vuko.</span>

Disruptis flashed Vuko a playful grin from the other side of the room and shrugged. “Hey, you know me man. What’s a few minutes late if the party never stops?”

The Tenno sat cross-legged on the table, watching the spectacle of the reunion unfold. He couldn’t help but break out in an beaming smile upon seeing Kapak greet the two, much like someone seeing their best friend receiving the perfect gift they picked out for them. The sight invigorated Disruptis. While their initial greeting had gone sour, at least he was able to gain some grain of delight in relishing the smiles of his fellow Tenno.

Well, minus Isa of course. But then again, Disruptis never could quite read that girl. Maybe she was happier than she let on, or maybe not.</span>

A small giggle escaped his mouth as Garhul pinned Kapak to the ground, one giant laying on top of the other. It was truly quite the sight, especially for Vuko who hasn’t seen Garhul this happy since... the accident.

He shifted his gaze towards the corpus-raised Tenno next. “And vice versa, Isa.” He knew he shouldn’t have expected much from her in the terms of a warm welcome, but he still hoped she would have shown the smallest bit of happiness. So it did sting a little bit seeing her as cold as ever.

Before he had a chance to answer Disruptis with yet another quippy line, Kapak had managed to free himself from the giant ball of fur and love and was now lifting Vuko in a bear hug. He groaned quietly while trying to speak out as the giant nearly crushed his torso. “...missed....you....too...” he managed to let out before being let go of. Once on the ground again he gasped for air while Kapak started bombarding him with questions.

“It’s a long story.” He managed to let out to respond to his friends questioning. As he mentioned Devros however, all the happiness fades from his face in almost an instant. He looks Kapak straight into where his eyes would be with an expression that can only mean one thing. He’s gone.

“How about I tell you everything later over a beer, eh?” His voices raspy, dry and filled with sorrow.</span>

The monster of a kubrow leans off the Nidus, his stubby little tail wagging as wild as it can, his tongue lolling down the side of his powerful maw that gives this goofy expression on to his furry face. There are few individuals that capture Garhul greatly, and while he was raised to be reserved and obedient, he couldn’t help but throw himself at the familiar friendly scent…the scent that mixed with <em>his</em> 

And so, joy…sticks to him…  

He let’s out a pleased gruff at the welcoming scratches, leaning in to the touch, his remaining ear pulling back to open up his face in to a bright display of <em>OH YEAH! RIGHT THERE!</em>

 The beast’s ear perks up as he hears a familiar snapping sound, urging him to lift his gaze upwards towards Kapak’s hands. Upon seeing a familiar sight, he let’s out another deep bark, licking his lips at the end. With a little butt wiggle, he stands up on his hind legs, stretching upwards in to his impressive height, his maw snatching at the prize and his front paws carefully pawing at Kapak’s front, holding for balance...thought...the leaning tower of Garhul might be a bit harder to hold for too long</span>

Kapak released the treat into the Kubrow&#39;s gaping maw before continuing to talk with Vuko. Voiddamn, he didn&#39;t know how little Devros could stand upright after enduring that much affection from such a beast.
Kapak gave a pat on the back to his old friend.
&quot;We have quite a bit to catch up on indeed,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;but not now.&quot;
He turned to Disruptis, quickly throwing a glance at Isa who was... characteristically impartial to everything happening. Nothing could stop Kapak from grinning like a goofball anyway. It was almost like having the Remnant back together again.
&quot;Okay... Bossman,&quot; Kapak said, bestowing his usual nickname for Mataeru on the yellow-suited Tenno before them, &quot;if you&#39;ve got any more suddenly alive friends, now&#39;s a good time to get them out. Otherwise, let&#39;s get on with this mission or whatever it is we&#39;re doing.&quot;</span>

Disruptis flinched.

“Ummm…” he murmured, nervously pulling on his collar. “Glad I have your support Kappa, but I don’t think I wanna pretend I’m filling boots as big as Mataeru’s. Just keep it normal.” 

Disruptis hopped off the table and attempted to fix up its map as best he could. “So, everyone gather round,” he continued, distributing some small wooden markers along the paper, “here’s what we know.”

The massive map showed a lot of scattered buildings with grineer symbols far to the west of the river. Disruptis drew an invisible line around them all. “Here are the closest grineer camps. They’re probably still holding the the captured as hostages. No way they’d let resources slip away, even if there’s next to no reason to do it. Our reconnaissance has been… hard. All we really know is that they change prisons a lot, bouncing from one camp to the next almost everyday. That means our fir-- er….”

The Tenno cut himself off just as he started getting carried away. Things couldn’t work that way this time. Void, he couldn’t even properly join them anyways. He looked up at everyone else with a sheepish expression, “Uh… er… Nevermind. Do you mind if you guys take on this mission without me? I’m not really fit to be a leader right now, and I’m still running tests on myself to see if I’m really alright up here.” Disruptis pointed a finger at his head. “Yes I know you guys have been making fun of my ‘smooth brain’ but what might be wrong will only hurt my fighting and strategy. It’s better if you guys make the plan for this one.”</span>

“That’s where I come in” Responded the Tenno, almost cutting into the end of Kapak’s story. Before continuing he gave a ‘nod of understanding’ to Disruptis. 

“You’ve been busy.” He said towards the Nidus with a little smile in the corner of his mouth. “You’re going to tell me all about that later. For now, I’ll be leading you into the compound.”</span>

“Eh, well muck, it looks like you won for once mate.” A voice chimed in from behind the group with a slight chuckle. An operator walked in with a pair of noticeable wired earpieces plugged into each ear. He was carrying a fire extinguisher in one hand as he approached. Cev span a platinum coin between the fingers of his free hand before throwing it over the heads of the gathered tenno over to Disruptis.</span>

The beast engulfs the finger but just as before, he shows no signs of chewing or swallowing…apparently preferring to keep the finger in his maw for whatever reason. The kubrow flips down on all fours once more, his tail wiggling…however it soon ceased at the familiar name being spoken. Devros.

His ear dips down slightly and the kubrow seems calmer than usual all of a sudden. He walks his way back towards Vuko, careful not to bump anyone or anything as he regains his original place beside the boy.</span>

Disruptis swiped the shiny coin out of the air and eyed it with a sneer. “Figures. The first time I win in three years, I only bet one coin.”

He pocketed the prize and returned his attention to the crowd. “Thanks Vuko. So as I said, the mission has two objectives. One, find out if the Grineer here are shaking some dirty hands, and two, rescue the villagers.” 

The Tenno quickly gave Isa a look. “Please,” he added.

“I’d sugges-- uh voiddammit-- You’re probably going to need to scout for intel first to find where the prisoners currently are. It’d probably be a good id...” Disruptis slapped both palms over each eye, “Ugh! Vuko what do you think you should do?”</span>

Without further ado, he was hunched over the table, studying the maps in search for any interesting clues that might give an advantage during the upcoming task.

When Cev comes in he doesn’t really bat an eye, as he’s absorbed with trying to memorise the entire surrounding terrain, with all plausible hiding, ambush, and otherwise suspicious spots. Only once Garhul comes back to him does he straighten up from the table and instinctively put his hand over the neck of the giant to pet him. 

“Well, as I see it we have two options.” He chimed in to respond to Disruptis’ query. “We either capture a reconnaissance squadron and try to force information out of them, but it’s not guaranteed they’ll even know anything. Alternatively we could try breaking into a facility and extract the prisoner travel schedule straight from their data vault. For this however, we would need to know where said vault is, which we don’t. Unless Dis has some more information he would like to share.” Vuko gives the black and yellow Tenno a look, as if a que to add some more details. “What do you think?” He asks as he turns around to face Cev, Kapak and Isa.</span>

Disruptis began to trace a circle around the three nearest hollow triangles, but quickly froze. He gingerly pulled his fingers back with a click of his tongue.</span>

His face takes on a wondering look as everyone starts voicing their opinions. “Hmmm...” He hums as a plan is formulating inside, his hand lightly stroking the chin.

“Let’s hope you’ve practiced your grineer, Kapak.” He said with a not so innocent smile sprawled across his face. “OK! So here’s how I think we should do this. We’re going to pass through the safe strait across the..” Vuko stops mid sentence as he bends over the table, trying to get a better look at what the map says. “Shitting? Oh wait no shifting! Across the shifting sands. From there we’re going to go for this one separate oil rig.” He points at the map towards the bottom right rig. “And we’re going all the way on foot to avoid any unnecessary attention. If we play this right they won’t even notice any Tenno were there. Them spotting us will bring unwanted attention to the village. In conclusion: no archwing or loud explosives.” Vuko deliberately gives Isa a stare after saying that, for obvious reasons.

“Once we’re next to the rig we’ll separate into two teams. Cev and I will first go inside in order to secure the highest ranking grineer in there, and subdue him non-lethally.” He said with emphasis on the last two words, making sure that it gets across. “On our signal Isa and Kapak will then storm the rest of the rig while we disable the alarm systems. If all goes properly, we will have access to both a hostage and the vault without raising any alarms.” Vuko stops for a quick re-breather, and gauge Disruptis’ response to the plan. “From there Isa and Cev will get to cracking the code, while Kapak and me have some fun with the commander.” He looks at his Nidus friend with a wicked expression on his face.</span>

He gave the Tenno an abnormally long middle finger (thanks to his mutated flesh) before falling serious once more to listen to the plan. Well, as serious as he could- a sputter escaped the Nidus&#39; jaws at the misreading of Disruptis&#39; map.
&quot;That sounds like a plan,&quot; Kapak said, once Vuko had finished. He gave a thumbs up, his hand morphing into various forms that some of the others may have recognized from Kapak&#39;s surgical procedures. He returned the mischievous grin to Vuko.</span>

“They’re um… uh… bigger rigs?” Disruptis replied before bursting into laughter at his own idiocy. He brought his breathing back under control and continued. “They’re kind of like supply and shelter bases mixed with a big fathermucking drill. Aren’t the only places villagers have been rotated, and they aren’t really favoured, but they have been used in the past. Also, the rectangles you see are dedicated storage warehouses. They aren’t in the rotation though.”

The yellow Tenno ran a hand through his ruffled black hair. At least that hadn’t left him. If there was one thing Disruptis couldn’t stand, it was being bald. “But yeah, sounds good Vuko. The grineer probably won’t give two mucks about saving a hostage, but he may have good info on how to find the captives, if you can crack him.”</span>

“I’m not hearing any objections, so... it’s settled!” He boomed at the end, whilst slamming both his hands on the table. “I’m assuming we should move out immediately?”  Vuko asked while turning his gaze to the yellow-clad Tenno, eager to get moving.

“Oh, and Kapak?” The Tenno interjected with a light-hearted tone on the side. “Do you know how to get in contact with Kuve? I still haven’t taken my blade back from her. You remember? The curved sword I inherited from my father?”</span>

The furry beast stood a few paces behind Vuko, his dull golden gaze jumping around the group as they shouted, talked, discussed between themselves, all the while slamming at this paper thing on the table. It’s a amusing thing to see…well…not as amusing at it is pleasant! This felt like old times, times full of laughter, warmth and so much cheer that it feels like it all happened in a different life. Nevertheless! Garhul feels calm in all of this, among all these people he’s met from a different era, their charisma clashing with one another. It is truly a moment of odd serenity. 

The enormous kubrow remained silent from his watch at the back, as he was trained to, occasionally clanking his teeth as he moves his lower jaw to readjust the treat in his mouth with his tongue, refusing to swallow it or even take a nibble! Some would think what he holds in his maw is some priceless treasure rather than a finger, with the way he cares for it in his mouth</span>

&quot;She&#39;s... late,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;very, very late, mind you. And, of course! How could I forget about that piece of craftsmanship? I always had found its design familiar in a bizarre way!&quot;
Kapak clicked his tongue and stuck both fists on his hips.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get a chance later to get your sword. We should move now! Dusk is upon us and we&#39;ll have the upper hand in the darkness.&quot;</span>

Disruptis nodded curtly in response to Vuko’s inquiry. A waft of warm desert air swept through the open window, blowing in the scent of some flowery fragrance. Outside, the sun sleepily closed its burning eye behind the sandy horizon.

Then as Isa explained Kuve’s fate, his eyebrow lifted up about half a mile. “Oh, is that what happened? That doesn’t sound like any kind of good,” he commented somberly.

<em>I should send people to look in on that…</em> The thought of the wild-spirited Tenno brought back bittersweet memories. Of tea parties, of battles, and of the crazy games they sometimes played. Disruptis remembered a time when Kuve marched right up to the sports supplies and pulled out some lunaro brackets and komi stones. Not willing to play either game, she invented her own using the items and a net. At first it was to see how many times people could toss it up to the air and catch it across the median, but it quickly devolved into everyone slinging stones at breakneck speeds to hit each other.

“May your soul rest well in the Void, dreamer. You’ve earned it,” Disruptis recited under his breath, too quiet for anybody to hear. The grief of losing her gently settled underneath his heart like a slowly sinking stone.</span>

He was almost in a jolly mood, despite Kapak saying that he doesn’t know where Kuve is at the moment, nor how to get his heirloom. The thought of going out there once again, with his friend by his side filled him with hope.

...that was until Isa opened her mouth. 
Hearing about Kuve’s death...

He froze. He just stood, rigidly still, as Isa’s words just floated into one ear, then went out the other. His face was chalk white, devoid of any sign of happiness that could’ve been seen before, a pale husk of the man that was there mere moments before.

Only after a long while, after Disruptis had paid his respects, and even moments after that, a single word of disbelief exited mouth. 

“...what.” Left his throat, his voice rasp, dry, and cracked.</span>

Nothing coherent could come out of the Nidus&#39; mouth. The Infested tendrils snaking from the crevices in his flesh drooped, the glowing boils growing on his muscles and through his bones shone ever dimmer.
Kapak bowed his head.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Vuko. I meant to tell you later... at a more appropriate time,&quot; Kapak managed finally, shooting Isa a dirty look (or as dirty as a face with nothing but a mouth can make), &quot;I wanted us to just... just to focus on this dumb mission...&quot;</span>

She looks to Disruptis now. &quot;After all, you do believe that these villagers may be being targeted in order to get to you, correct? If that is true, and they know they are dealing with a Tenno, then the Grineer may indeed be trying to lure a lone Tenno out into a trap in order to capture one to experiment on or simply to test this new weapon. It has been nearly a year since we first encountered them with working versions. They may have found a way to produce more of them, enough that they could be used out in the field.&quot; There was not one sign of sadness, or regret in her voice, no empathy for Vuko or the others. The grief she had over Kuve&#39;s death, if she even had any in the first place, had clearly already passed.</span>

Disruptis’s eyes widened in shock at the sudden realization of what had been said. He had always known that Vuko had a close relationship with Kuve, but it didn’t register until he witnessed the Tenno’s reaction. Disruptis never stopped to think about the implications of anyone else’s grief.

<em>Oh muck.</em>

“That is… uh,” he spoke up, “True…”

Disruptis leaned in close to the side of Isa’s concealed head and positioned a hand to cover the side of his mouth. “ᴮᵘᵗ ᶦᵗ&#39;ˢ ᵖʳᵒᵇᵃᵇˡʸ ⁿᵒᵗ ᵃ ᵍᵒᵒᵈ ᶦᵈᵉᵃ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉⁿᵗᶦᵒⁿ ᴷᵘᵛᵉ ᶦⁿ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ” he whispered.</span>

As his eyes glossed over from tears that he refused to let escape, it was like something... broke inside of him. Something deeply rooted, something so fundamental that Vuko hadn’t even imagined it could be gone. 

As little cyan embers begun to dance on his fingertips, and his eyes filled with unbridled rage, the Tenno leapt forward in anguish towards Isa, intent on closing his fingers around her small, breakable neck.</span>

Isa caught Vuko&#39;s movement out of the corner of her eye. She immediately raised her left hand and let out a beam of void energy aimed directly at Vuko, center of mass. She did not hold back at all with the destructive energy, and just like her void fire, it was more potent than most other Tenno. She would sustain it while stepping back away from Vuko until his advance stopped or he reached her, taking a few steps back as she did so. She maintained her usual calm demeanor despite the fact that she was firing a beam of destructive void energy at her ally. At least she wasn&#39;t using an amp.</span>

One does not need to understand the conversation happening to know that something, somewhere, went wrong. The atmosphere in the room dropped down to a tense chill and Garhul glanced towards his anchor, the friend he’s met on the island. Him and Vuko have spent months and months together so he’s learned to pick up on the emotions emitting from the war-blood kiddo. Vuko was hurting and Garhul could sense it. This anguish has manifested itself with a mixture of furry and heartbreak…a emotion that once consumed his greatest friend...but he helped Devros then and he will help Vuko now!

The kubrow didn’t think much of it, he is a protector from both physical and emotional pain, these things are in his nature, in his genes and in his guts! 

The lumbering beast makes a desperate jump towards Vuko in a attempt to tackle the boy to the floor with his paws before he could reach Isa, not minding that he’s practically leaping in front of a molten laser that would set his flesh ablaze.</span>

As Vuko silently thought, Disruptis moved back over to the map. He couldn’t read the expressionless mask his fellow Tenno wore, but he suspected it was bad. Disruptis immediately began drafting and experimenting a dozen ways to salvage the situation in his quick, Naramonic mind.

But then it all went to the Void.

Everything happened faster than Disruptis could work out a plan of action for. In the split seconds that Vuko lunged at Isa, the Tenno only managed to jump on the table and ready himself to intervene.</span>

He was about halfway towards Isa when the beam reached his chest, stopping him dead in his tracks. It wasn’t however enough to blast the Tenno back. He dug his heels in and tried to withstand the devastating stream of energy boring into his abdomen, his clothes lighting ablaze as a result.

But Vuko didn’t care. He was all but consumed with grief, and the attack on him sure as void wasn’t going to stop him. 

That is if Garhul hadn’t jumped in to protect him. The giant beast had no problems tackling him out of the way and down to the ground, taking a part of the damage directed at Vuko as a result.</span>

Lucky for Garhul, he didn’t stay in the laser’s path for more than a second as he tackled the boy and went down to the ground with him, the void beam traveling from his right shoulder down his side and ending at the upper rim of his rib cage. The fire not lingering long enough to burn his fur but it did scorch his flesh as it traveled, leaving the smell of burnet meat to linger in the air.

But, the beast didn’t notice the pain, nor did he care for it, as he flopped on top of Vuko with his chest, like a comfy and heavy blanket. He was hugging the boy on the floor, his forehead pressing against the others cheek in a protective manner…low whines call out to him in a plea, showing Vuko that he is here in his moment of ache. Garhul was calm, still, hoping his weight and affection would shine through and calm the raging storm within Vuko’s heart. On this, he would not budge, no matter how much Vuko would protest as he understand the boys pain…he too has lost someone precious.

When one person is missing the whole world seems empty.</span>

Isa stopped her beam as Garhul knocked the hostile Tenno over, doing her best to avoid scorching the kubrow. She found it somewhat ironic, the kubrow acting far more rational than Vuko at the moment. She walked around Garhul now, looking down at Vuko, her face hidden  behind whatever hood she wore. The fingers of her right hand twitched somewhat ominously.

&quot;How disappointing.&quot; She said before turning to Dispruptis. &quot;Perhaps someone more mentally stable should lead this mission.&quot;</span>

“Can all of you just chill for five mucking seconds?!?!??” Disruptis cried out in anguish, rushing over to the growing fire. He desperately patted the fire with open hands in an attempt to keep it down, but it only encouraged the flames to grow larger. <em>Hot hot hot!!!</em>

As Cev slew the flames, Kapak began to calm down. Eventually he made his way back to the main attraction and stood (although quite nervously) next to Isa, observing Vuko&#39;s rage from above.
&quot;Look Vuko, we all know how Isa is. She can be, frankly, a real arsehole. But she&#39;s far from evil.&quot;
He knelt down and stroked Garhul&#39;s fur as the Kubrow continued to keep Vuko subdued.
&quot;Those genetic freaks- the Grineer. They&#39;re the real target here. And if you can hold it together now, your patience will be rewarded.&quot;
Kapak stopped petting Garhul and laid one of his skeletal hands on Vuko&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Also if you calm down I won&#39;t have to inject you with some Voiddamn anesthesia.&quot;</span>

The kubrow didn’t move from his position atop Vuko, he continued to hug him on the floor, his muzzle burying between his own chest and the boys. He felt a hand on him, stroking him but he didn’t move at all, his entire focus is on protecting Vuko from his raging mind and shattered heart.</span>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
“Wai--” Disruptis defensively brought his arms in front of his face as Cev showered both him and the fire in cold carbon dioxide.

The flame was quenched, but the yellow Tenno sporting a new white coat.

“Ulgh,” Disruptis grunted in disgust, holding up his drenched sleeves. He cleared the fluid from his face with a deliberate swipe and crouched down. The wooden floor gained a glossy sheen as the hunched over Tenno wiped his suit against it.

“Look,” Disruptis announced, his voice languid and his gaze shifting in the quarreling Tenno’s direction. “Vuko, please stop. Kuve wouldn’t want this… and I’m sure you don’t actually want to take it out on us. Isa…”

He stood up and strode over to the two. Putting a hand on Isa’s shoulders, he gently but firmly pushed her away from the enraged Vuko and stared straight into the location he believed her eyes to rest. 

“..this isn’t some edgy postmodernistic movie scene. We’re all that’s left,” he continued in a subdued tone. Dismay creeped into his voice like the evening tide on the moonlit sands. “All of it. We need to look out for each other, because there’s not many left to support us.”</span>

Disruptis removed his hands from Isa and turned his face to everyone in the room. “I don’t know about you guys but… I always hoped that… the Remnant meant a little more than a banner to everyone. I… call me delusional but I saw us as great kin. I want to get us all together again and rebuild what could’ve been, because unlike Mataeru I value our bounds more than our objectives.” His confessions of hopes and dreams spilled out from his mouth as if pent up for a century.

He pounded a fist on the table. “And I’ll be MUCKED if anyone takes that away from me! Even Hunhow himself!”

His words lapsed into silence for a couple moments, his turned back obscuring any facial expressions that might be leaking across his face, hunched over where he punched the table. 

“If any of you have had enough of all of us... of all this... and want out,” the yellow Tenno’s voice cracked. “Please... leave now.”</span>

The Nidus crossed its arms as it stood up, looked across the room at the other parties.
The silence was deafening. At least, until Kapak finally broke it.
&quot;Look, I&#39;m not the sappy type usually,&quot; Kapak said, lifting a hand, &quot;but Disruptis is right. We were a family once. And that&#39;s quite a bit coming from someone like me who can&#39;t stay in the same place very long.&quot;
Kapak sighed as he leaned over, wrapping his hands around Garhul and attempting to lift the monstrous Kubrow off of Vuko.
&quot;Isa, why don&#39;t you get back to your ship and get some of your heaviest ordinance? We could probably use it.&quot;
Kapak turned his head to face Vuko, his eyeless, glistening skull reflecting the Tenno&#39;s visage.
&quot;Vuko... I... I&#39;m sorry. I wanted to break the news to you at a later point. I remember clear as day how tight you were with her. A Tenno I knew once told me the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb, and that was as clear as day with you two.&quot;
Kapak sighed.
&quot;I suppose if it made you feel better you could take some of your anger out on me, um, unless there&#39;s fire involved. But I have to a agree with Isa. Let&#39;s save it for those Voiddamn Grineer.&quot;
Assuming Kapak had been successful in moving Garhul, he extended an infested hand towards Vuko, offering to help him to his feet.</span>

He wasn’t happy. This whole situation triggered in him something that isn’t going to be quenched easily. However, Disruptis’s words managed to at least calm him down enough, so as he stopped his attempted assault on Isa.
The Tenno delicately pushed on the Kubrow, telling him to let go. 

Once Vuko’s free from the crushing weight, he stands up by himself, not accepting Kapak’s help. 
“Garhul, let’s go.” Without as much a comment on the speech, he attempts to leave the room, walking straight through whoever stood in his way. 

However, in a moment of hesitation, he pauses in the doorway for a moment. “I’ll see you at sundown.” He added, in a still clearly pissed, dried out voice, and then left.</span>

Even when the fleshy Nidus tugged him, the kubrow refused to leave. Only when he felt the gentle push from the boy bellow him did he move from atop him, feeling as if the wave that overtook Vuko finally lifted. The behemoth let out a huff through his nose, taking a glance at the people around before trotting after Vuko.</span>

&quot;Sick of this? No... news of this odd Sentient has finally piqued my interest. I just hope you can keep the more emotional ones under control.&quot;

&quot;What the muck&#39;s stealth?&quot; Kapak said with a grin as he stepped to the door.
The grin was as superficial as it got though- the Tenno had dreamt of reuniting with his old... friends... but...
He&#39;d imagined it to go over far more smoothly than what just happened. Vuko&#39;s bitterness seemed potent enough for the Nidus to taste.
&quot;I&#39;ll be back at sundown as well. We&#39;ve got a couple hours to prepare it looks like, and I&#39;m a bit hungry. I wouldn&#39;t want to kill this village off by eating all their supplies. Good to see you again, Disruptis.&quot;

Disruptis stood in place, unwavering. Then with languid motion, he straightened his back and folded his arms behind his back like Mataeru had so famously done. The Tenno hoped the action would inspire him with the same strength it seemed to bestow his former leader. With a flick of his fingers, the platinum coin flung itself from his grasp. Its fall to the floor sounded more like thuds than a clinks in the heavy atmosphere.

“Alright, leave me you two,” Disruptis ordered, his face still turned, “I’ll see you in a bit.”</span>

She cast off the primitive robe that was covering her warframe before attaching herself to the archwing and blasting off to be picked up by her landing craft at a higher altitude... her exit was far from a subtle one, but she&#39;d  be damned if she had to deal with walking through the village and encountering more of its curious children.</span>

The cool evening breeze ruffled Disruptis’s unzipped hood about in slow movements, like an ocean’s high tide. His gaze pierced into a beautiful horizon lit ablaze by the lowering sun. The wind churned whorls of pink petals into the room that threw themselves all over the floor.

<em>Heh.</em>

The sounds of chimes rung out in delightful chorus as each of the workers used them to send messages amongst each other. It was an old tradition.

<em>Ha.</em>

Cartfuls of harvest clambered up the roads in chains now with villagers boasting their work amongst themselves. They laughed and cried out in joyous companionship.

“HAAAAAAAAAAAA!” Disruptis roared, smashing a fist onto the already thoroughly abused table. His face contorted into a twisted grimace like that of a raving animal. The Tenno couldn’t properly express the emotion he was feeling at that moment as anything other than raw madness. The dead, the infighting, the threat looming so heavily on his shoulders he can’t even breathe. The loss, the pain, the failure. And above it all....

Disruptis lifted his head upwards, as if trying to stare daggers into the ceiling.

“This… is what you wanted, right?” he asked, still alone in the room.

Void energy began pooling in his body as Disruptis channeled it into his hands. The numerous scars etched all across his skin burned with a purplish intensity, lighting the operator up like a firefly.

Then the sun closed its lazy eye on the machinations of the remnants of a remnant.

Harsh scarlet light struck the scarred side of Disruptis’s face. The sandy winds of a desert’s night felt cool and invigorating to the touch, like the cold embrace of impending doom. The atmosphere screamed ‘go on the hunt, or go to sleep’. The yellow operator cracked half a grin.

<em>No better hunter than a Tenno.</em>

Disruptis currently sat positioned on the border of the lush green vegetation of Kawamo. Unfortunately, the heavily engineered greenery waned quickly without the presence of a couple drops of water. He managed to rebuild his contact databases and send a message out to each of his old allies in their new shaky alliance. One could only hope everyone would be able to focus on the task at hand.

The Tenno averted his eyes from their trance on the flare he had left smoking in the desert sediment and turned them to the sky. <em>They should be here any time now…</em> he thought.

A dark violet glow pulsed through every scar on Disruptis’s body once again as he channeled the Naramonic energy to his sight. The soft light encompassed his ebony eyes as well. The Tenno scoured his field of view for any sort of approaching object.</span>

<em>From behind the green, lit by the vermilion, adrift in the tide, he came
A mare - nay, a specter, denying being torn out of this reality
With each stride anchoring itself deeper and deeper
Material only once in the nocturnal gown</em>

As Vuko, clad in a torn, dark cloak, approached, Disruptis could feel it. Like the smell of ozone before a storm. The unbridled rage, thirst for vengeance, for mindless slaughter, emanating from him. 
He didn’t say a word. All that needed to be spoken, already has been.

He just stood there, awaiting as the desert breeze played with his mantle, revealing the outcome of horrors past.

A tug on the leg - revealing one limb is different than the other, more... crude, mechanical, fake

A sway to the side - showing the elongated visor, armored breastplate, and battacor held in his clutch

A push at the back - exposing a rigid posture, a zylok on the holster, and a scindo axe hidden underneath the cloak

Disruptis was not one to be surprised at such a sight. After all, he was his captor, savior and editor. 
Others, not so much. 
Seeing Vuko’s Ivara mended, altered and redone, could even come as shocking. The new look reminded almost nothing of the old, golden and proud Orokin style. It brings to mind a soldier, a mercenary, a hunter. A merger of Tenno and Corpus technology intertwined to result in something completely new and unique.</span>

Following close to the Frankenstein Ivara is none other than the ever so faithful behemoth of a kubrow. The crimson pelted beast gives his head a shake, his body not yet used to the refitted armor that his friend managed to make from high quality scrap in a quick hurry. He never did have need of protective gear, mainly cause Devros’ Oberon constantly supplied him with regeneration from whatever wounds managed to inflict him. But now, he does not have that protection and with a lot of nagging from Vuko’s side he managed to accept it and let the boy fit the armor on to his bulky frame. It was nothing fancy, the armor itself is mainly aimed to protect his head as well as provide some additional spikes on to his sides for other…uses.

While feeling restricted by it, he has a basic understanding that this uncomfortable “suit” will help him in some way so he’s willing to put up with the feeling. The kubrow gives his left front leg a wiggle to test the attachment on it and feels satisfied when it doesn’t just ping out. He takes his position left of Vuko and let’s his dull golden eyes scan the area, his one working ear rotating on top of his massive head while he constantly adjusts the armor on to his body with light twitches.</span>

&quot;Well, well, well, what is this here?&quot; Kapak seemed to appear from nowhere- a common trait of the Nidus. Always stealthy when not trying, but unbearably terrible at it with effort.
&quot;I guess I&#39;m not the only weirdo-frame in the group, now, am I?&quot; The mutant Warframe&#39;s mouth rested on a crooked grin as per usual.
Kapak sniffed.
&quot;Hmm. You smell funny. Must be all that machinery,&quot; Kapak said, reaching out to lightly flick the Ivara&#39;s prosthetics.
&quot;Really reminds me of the Strider&#39;s frame, huh? With all the missing bits and such. Say, has Disruptis told you &#39;bout that whole... thing?&quot;
Kapak paused to give Garhul a quick rub while peering at Disruptis. The Nidus&#39; lighthearted speech was obviously there to attempt and cheer up his comrades, but it was still abundantly clear that he wasn&#39;t oblivious to the still-high-strung tensions from earlier.</span>

Isa&#39;s Saryn arrived shortly after Kapak, bearing heavy orndance: a zarr, a modified angstrum purchased from none other than the illustrious Baro Kiteer, and her usual sentient  blade. She had been advised not to take an army of MOAs with her, much to her chagrin. Though given the wildlife here they would probably just draw more attention and possibly get ripped apart. Still, she had loaded a few onto her landing craft so it could fly in and release them once they reached camp.

&quot;I have a unit of MOAs on standby if we need them.&quot; She said, looking around to the others, giving a nod of acknowledgement to Vuko and his curiously repaired Ivara. &quot;So. Shall the hunt begin?&quot;</span>

“Yeah,” Disruptis quickly answered Isa, “be careful out there. I’ve put up an objective pointer on one of our old squad HUD frequencies. Get your cephalon to switch to it if you haven’t already. I’ll recap while you get set up.”

The Tenno cancelled his enhanced vision and let the colours of his skin return to normal. He walked towards the horizon opposite the lush forest. “Vuko shot an idea about getting into the nearest camp to nab some data on where our hostages went to. Then you can track them down and rescue them. That’s priority number one.”

Disruptis paused for a moment, considering his next words. He knew he really shouldn’t let himself talk, but the situation had changed and he wasn’t exactly sure of what to make of it anymore. “While it’ll probably be a nasty time trying to take down the camp-wide alarms, you can at least stop word getting out to the other drill sites. Now, while this is priority one, the main reason you’re here is to find out what kind of assistance the grineer are getting to help them push in across the desert so easily. If you can find that out we might get some leads to something <em>real</em> cool.”

He smiled after the last line and shifted his gaze into the bright sky for a second. There wasn’t much light pollution to hide the swirls of distant galaxies.</span>

The stoic figure kept silent as the dusk wind kept tarnishing his cloak. His hand reached out to scratch Garhul, an automatic, thoughtless act that has developed over the past months as a sort of coping mechanism.
The Nidus’ arrival made him feel... well, he wasn’t sure what. Had this been just a few hours prior Vuko no doubt would be cracking jokes alongside Kapak, both masking their pain in a shared, delusional comedy. 
Now? There was something intangible between them. The once doubtless faith in his friend was dimmed... by what could only be the seed of distrust.
“No, he hasn’t.” The jarred, modified voice of Vuko responded in a disheartened tone.

Isa’s arrival got in between what further development could have been had, causing the Ivara to turn to her, producing a glare that could be seen all the way through the warframe. The sharpness almost felt as two needles about to puncture the skin. “Is <em>this</em> your idea of stealth gear?” Vuko give the argument a moment to sink in, before continuing. “We won’t be taking any MOAs. Or using any explosives. You’re to stay put unless I say so, understood?” There wasn’t any room for leeway in the voice. He clearly had enough of her. Enough of it all. Enough of himself. Vuko manifested his pain not by crying. His eyes have long stopped doing it, else he would drown in his own tears.

Cev, late to join the party, was more or less left with no answer as Vuko just meaningfully looked at Disruptis in response, not bothering to say more.

“Let’s go.” He exclaimed to the team, as his feet left the remains of the grass, and stepped into the rough sand. His steps accompanied by nothing more than the grinding of the grains. Without waiting for anyone, the Ivara was heading through the narrow passage.</span>

Kapak watched Vuko stepping away from the group and sighed. He turned to Isa and shrugged, wiping saliva from his jaw.

&quot;Keep the Moas on standby in a nearby location,&quot; Kapak spoke in a low voice to Isa, &quot;we might need them. But, until then, we&#39;ll not. I&#39;m sure you brought enough tools to create distractions nonetheless?&quot; Kapak began to walk forward after Vuko, stopping briefly to lay a reassuring hand on Disruptis&#39; shoulder.

&quot;He hasn&#39;t had time to properly grieve,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;I can&#39;t smell his emotions from this new Warframe of his, but I can definitely tell he&#39;s distressed. We just have to get through these next few weeks without anyone ripping anyone apart.&quot;
Kapak shot Cev a quick glance as well. &quot;Look after him, eh?&quot;</span>

&quot;Yes.&quot;
She responded to Vuko&#39;s question with no hesitation. This was, in fact, her idea of stealth gear.
&quot;The blade is for stealth. The other weapons, including the MOAs are available as a contingency or distraction if necessary.&quot;
The grass moved a bit near her, not in any way the wind could affect it. Her kubrow appeared with a shimmer and a low growl. It was a large one, though not a hulking beast like Garhul. Ordo was a sleek Huras kubrow, a hunter skilled at silently stalking its prey. His master&#39;s hand gently reached out and rested upon his head.
&quot;Still. Stealth is far from my specialty. I fully intend to stick to the outskirts and stay hidden with Ordo&#39;s help. With or without silenced weapons, I would not be able to infiltrate the camp effectively, even with him. I will be on standby to provide support or a distraction if needed, and the MOAs are available to be dropped in via landing craft.&quot;
Her voice was perfectly civil and emotionless, with no attempt to argue, simply explaining her preparation as fact, with not a care in the world for what Vuko had to say about it. She had her methods and she stuck to them.</span>

The behemoth appreciated the scratches and touches on his pelt, in fact he welcomed them greatly, it made him feel…welcomed, loved, happy. I suppose you can say that what he is feeling is a spark of home and security. His ear kept track of the mouthed words that the two-leggeds were mumbling between themselves but his gaze was trained on the other kubrow in the mids. His nose wiggled in the air to absorb the information of the other, his mind thinking of food and play all of a sudden as if he was a pup again. Before he could make a move on the smaller kubrow Vuko broke off, snapping Garhul’s attention back at his friend.

The bulky kubrow quickly breaks in to a trot to follow after Vuko. Large he may be, lumbering and thundering, but a ignorant pup he is not and while he knows that he is not suited for stealth he is still a trained protector, and protect he shall!</span>

Cev watched Vuko walk away from the group and glanced back as Kapak spoke. Lone piano chords played in somber staccato in the background of Cev’s personal coms. A sole singer joined in their voice, resonating with the tone to create a beautiful melody before cutting off and leaving everything in silence.

“Of course mate I’ll keep an eye on him,” He shook his head, turning to go after Vuko. “Oh and Isa,” he said without looking back, “maybe try not being a gut-brain for once in your life.”</span>

Something unseen flashed through Disruptis’s eyes as he regarded Vuko’s back with a neutral expression. His scarred fingers clenched and unfurled. <em>&#39;Void doesn’t give me enough for this,</em> he thought. A mostly nonsensical, incoherent ramble.

He turned to Isa and mouthed with a more tender smile. <em>Thank. You.</em> he mouthed. No further explanation, just a little bit of gratitude, even if the Tenno didn’t think much of it. Which she probably didn’t.

Fifteen minutes after leaving the fertile land of Kawamo, the group had reached the piece of land designated as ‘Safe Strait’. It was adequately named, as evident by the massive stretches of darker-colour sand flanking both sides. Their short walk, they had been hearing strange guttural sounds here and there in the distance. Now, they were also accompanied by sloshing.

“Oh!” Disruptis’s voice butt into the warframe’s comms. “The Grinner commander watching over the happenings here goes by the name ‘Corporal Mok’ just in case you wanted to know. Mucker’s got presence, that’s for sure. He ain’t that shabby of a chief, not that it makes our work any easier. He’s cunning. Not really that smart, just cunning.”</span>

“Understood.” Was all that came from him in view of the new information. He just kept going forward, following the course he had layed out on the map, hoping that others will just fall in line. 

While being silent on the outside, on the inside there was a raging conversation. He was... confused. Angry and confused. But mostly confused. In this self-absorbed state he pushed  on, ignoring what other things his squad had to say.</span>

Isa paused for a half second as she heard the sound of music playing in her comms. &quot;Yes... nice selection.&quot;
Her voice was completely lacking in sincerity as she proceeded to block the music out of the comm channel. She would continue along, enjoying the sound of nothing more than the sound of their footsteps until the rumbling became audible.

It was getting closer. Isa shifted the grip on her Zarr into a more ready position. It clicked softly as she set it to flak mode. It continued to draw closer now... she stopped in her tracks and waited. It was coming for her from beneath the sand. She was ready when the worm made its appearance, leaping away from it, forward toward the others, twisting in the air  to fire a burst of flak at the beast, trying to aim for the mouth. She would be somewhat close to it when she fired still, though she would only be able to make one shot before her bullet jump carried her away from it.</span>

He felt the rumbling beneath his paws and he paused his run to look around, his one working ear dancing atop his head like a homing satellite. He yipped towards Vuko, hoping to grab the others attention but that bark was overshadowed by the tumbling appearance of the worm. He watched, in utter surprise and horror at the display of it. Never has he seen something that lives to be that huge.

But he had little to dwindle on it as the worm started to trash about. The behemoth dashed towards Vuko’s side, ready to boost shields or be mounted if need be for his four legs carried faster and his bulk was enough to support the Ivara.</span>

After the worm dug itself into the sand and the sights of Vuko’s battacor, he stood there with an absentminded look in his eyes, trying to figure out what to do in this situation.

One of Kapak’s sentences did however get through to him. “Stop!” He urgently let out to Kapak. “That’s a bad idea. You’ll get swallowed in the sands.” He said, surprising himself that he still cared about the Nidus. 

“We should move on, the faster we get to the camp the better. I’m changing the order. Isa, you go first with that cannon of yours at the ready. Closely behind you Cev and then Kapak. Cev, focus on cloaking the two of them, and Kapak try to... I don’t know sense it or something? I’ll be covering your back in prowl.” As he ended Vuko stepped to the side of the straight, giving room for everyone to pass him by while he went into prowl.

In the meantime his a bit shaking hand reached towards Garhul and started petting him, but it looked like it was more to cool his nerves rather than for the Kubrow.</span>

The Saryn nodded sagely and took the lead. She switched the Zarr into its cannon mode, as the flak seemed less effective than she would have liked. She moved somewhat slowly, listening carefully for the worm, but did switch on the annoying Octavia tunes at this point, keeping their volume as low as possible. Ordo took his place at her heels, his ears swiveling about as he listened for the creature that had attacked his master. There was a  small <em>thunk</em> as Isa loaded another shot down the muzzle of the cannon. It was a good thing she hadn&#39;t opted for stealth gear.</span>

Isa was ready for it to return. She already had her weapon raised as it surfaced. When it remained still with its maw open, she saw an opportunity and took it. The sound of the cannon echoed across the desert as she fired a cluster charge  straight down the beast&#39;s gullet. It would detonate on impact. That should get this thing to leave them alone if its head remained intact.

Disruptis’s Naramonic mind rapidly pieced together the information flowing through to him on the comms and drew a couple speculations. Back in the original meeting room, the yellow Tenno scurried past wood ornaments and silk curtains to the far side of the pavillion. He picked apart a table cluttered with canvas, paper, and worn books until he found one with a burgundy cover.

<em>Didn’t expect them to run into anything quite yet…</em>

“Wait wait wait, what’s there exactly?” Disruptis inquired, the blood draining from his face just a little, “This is important.”</span>

A raging inferno spewed forth from the worm’s maw, breaking through the quiet darkness. The beast whipped its singed head back and forth three times, then flung itself upon the sand. There it lay still, slowly being swallowed by the wet sands. The fiery embers quietly retreated from existence in plumes of smoke and ash.

Then something surfaced.

It was a dark object. Two pulsating blue rings flanked either side of it. From the Tenno’s perspective, it was merely a sphere mostly submerged in sand some ten meters away.

Then, another came. It showed no light.

Then, another. And another. And another. Without a sound, the pools of sediment surrounding the group dotted itself with… things, lurking in the dark.

Nothing made a move.~</span>

He hurriedly started walking towards the end of the straight as fast as he could without breaking the cloak. “Move your butts along. I don’t want to stay long enough to find out what those things are.”</span>

Cev ceremonious plucked a small ball resting on the hip of his warframe and pressed a button on the top of it.

Disruptis let out some of the breath he found himself holding. Things weren’t that bad. The Tenno paused his fanning of the worn book, his eyes resting on a page depicting a gigantic toad-like creature sporting tentacles from its neck and appendages.

“Alright, just back off with a cloak on. We really don’t have the time to be poking the nest of a beehive thousands of acres wide,” Disrupits commented. After the words left his mouth, he immediately regretted it and bit down on his tongue. He needed to stop.

~Six of the nearest objects sunk back beneath the surface as the group walked away underneath a cloak. It was obvious that they had made the right choice to walk away when they did, as after travelling not a couple meters away from the roller six gigantic worms with their own unique mutations burst from the sands. They all lunged for Cev’s resonator like a bunch of Tenno all diving for a Lunaro near the end of a match.

What little neon light the roller brought forth into the darkness was swallowed whole by a descending wall of darkness.~

“Oh, and now that you’re near the other side, you should conceal yourself as much as possible,” Disruptis continued, switching tone, “Remember those chiroptera creatures I was mentioning earlier? The Akuul? Well, night time’s meal time for them. They occasionally manage to make a pass on village stock, but they tend to throw their parties out where you are. While you’ll be able to trick their sharp eyes with a cloak, you won’t be able to get away from th&#39; echolocation. They use both quite well, trust me.”

~Vuko, Cev, and Isa neared the end of the strait. The night was just starting and they were already in hot water. Unfortunately, much like a local Plutonian business man whipping out his second line of magic powder in under an hour, their mission was just getting started.

The strait ended where large, sloping dunes began. The entrance do this elevated dune area formed a kind of a half-bowl facing the Tenno. Blocking the way onwards, however, was an eight-meter tall feline. Its textured fur blended into the backdrop of sand as it stared down the strait with large black eyes. The hunter crouched low, poised to pounce.

Its muscles were wound-up spring traps ready to burst forth on some unsuspecting prey, tail subtly twitching back and forth. The only one to notice the beast at first were the Kubrows&#39; sharp noses.

Meanwhile, a short stretch of distance behind, Kapak popped back into sight. He wasn’t near Cev anymore to get his benefit from his melodies. A cluster of the other murky objects in the sands began slinking towards him.~</span>

He gave Isa a gloating look after Disruptis told them to stay hidden, almost as if the Ivara’s visor was saying ‘I told you so.’ with a smug face.

“We go single file, everyone step where Isa steps, I don’t want the enemy to know how many of us there are. C’mon, let’s move it.” He started to move his hand in circles, pressuring them to go forward. “Let’s keep the formation Isa, Cev, and... Kapak?” Vuko started to look around confused, only now realising he’s missing a person. “Where the-“ His sentence interrupted by the Nidus showing up behind them on the strait, about to be pounced. “Oh by the void!”

Without a moments hesitation Vuko straightened his back into a proper archery position while a long, straight, sleek, bow made out of a composite alloy appeared in his hands. Not three seconds passed by before he had already pulled and released the string, sending an arrow with a delicate ‘whoosh’ straight into Kapak’s torso. The projectile would give Kapak about ~20 seconds of invisibility.

All the while the Ivara was completely blind to the beast, as not only was it blending in with the surrounding but he also has turned its back to it.</span>

He kept close to Vuko, despite the chaos of the worm, of the lights and the explosions he kept his calm and trailed behind the stealthy archer, cloaked just as him. He’s seen battle and war as much as any Tenno, been on the front lines from the start of it all, defending and protecting. He watches what Vuko does and how he moves, knowing the ques from the smallest of movements, movements he started understanding from his time with the Tenno on that lonely island.

But then…something unusual came about. A scent! What is it? Where is it? Garhul started sniffing the air, his ear and head whipping about to spot the source of it. There! Is it?

The kubrow quickly halted his advancement, turned around to face the direction of the prowling feline, his posture tall and threatening as he let out a deep rumbling growl, not loud enough to break his stealth but loud enough for Vuko to know that something was up.</span>

Isa was entirely clueless to the smug look. Staying hidden was wise, but they didn&#39;t have the equipment to remain hidden from a worm. Hopefully they wouldn&#39;t encounter anything else like that. She continued along after being given approval by Vuko. As they continued, Ordo let out a slow growl and nudged the Saryn&#39;s leg. She immediately came to a halt, raising her  hand to signal for the others to stop as well.

Her head swiveled to gaze on Garhul as well, then looked to see where that kubrow was looking. &quot;There&#39;s something here.&quot; She said over comms. She raised her Zarr to a ready position, searching the area. &quot;I&#39;ll wait on you to fire now.&quot; She said, turning her head slightly toward Vuko. &quot;Given your frame&#39;s sensory capabilities, it may be best for you to take the lead.&quot;</span>

The Invisibility arrow from Vuko’s bow wasn’t designed to hurt, but was enough to snap Kapak back to his senses.
“By the Orokin, what in the Void just happened?” Kapak stood up fully, his bone armour vibrating slightly to shake the sand from the cracks and crevices along his Warframe.
He looked around for a moment, seeing where the others were. He lifted an arm, noticing the blurry, unfocused, translucent appearance and realized he was cloaked.
Now empowered by the apparent safety of invisibility, Kapak began to jog over the the rest of the group, oblivious to anything else that was currently happening.</span>

The flapping, no, <em>beating</em> of wings in the night sent a very faint draft of cool desert breeze cascading over the group. The camouflaged feline straightened, eyes darting back and forth around the starry night sky. It shivered.

Meanwhile, Kapak found nothing attempting to make a move, that he could see. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught something flicker over top of the wet sands. Even if he had stopped to take a chance to look it wouldn’t have yielded anything, for a gigantic black pillar rose out of the sediment and swallowed it whole.~</span>

Seeing that Kapak was making it towards the rest of the group, he turned back towards the direction they were supposed to go and sighed. “Like taking care of a bunch of preschoolers....” He said to himself, hopefully quiet enough that the others won’t hear.

“Huh?” He exclaimed, Gargul’s growl ticking him off. “Yeah, Garhul’s picking up too. I’m investigating.” With that, Vuko raised his battacor into firing position and began charging a heavy blast. Carefully placing his footsteps, he began slowly advancing forward towards whatever the Kubrows were feeling. Before he could get whatever it was within his radar range, the strange pitch reached his warframe. “Cev, what is that? Give me an analysis.” He commanded, not changing his pace.</span>

“Void that didn’t last long at all…” Disruptis mumbled to himself, briefly switching off his comms for the uttering. “Yeah, we’re in a little hotter water now that you started travelling this late. That’d be the akuul you’re hearing: they just started to hunt.”

Disruptis leafed through the book until he found a page depicting a bat-like monster. “Your invisibility’s gonna be pretty useless against those things. You’ll be able to kill ‘em, especially with Vuko’s exalted bow, but there’s gonna be a lot of ‘em.”

He slammed the book shut with one hand. “You’re not that far from the drill now. You should be safe from them there. Personally, I’d feel this is a great time to get some air in your lungs—and <em>run</em>.”</span>

Once the Nidus turned to ask Vuko about his Artemis, he would quickly realize that the frame was no longer there and all that was left is a comical trail of sand rising upwards. Heeding the warning the Ivara was already dashing for dear life in the direction of the drill.</span>

Cev shook his head at the sight of vuko bolting away from the group. “Well okay then. Come on Isa, let’s bolt!” He exclaimed, placing his bow on his back before breaking into a full sprint after Vuko. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F2A-mgZQpY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F2A-mgZQpY</a>     

Cev and Isa’s legs felt almost weightless as they began running, allowing them to move faster. The cloak dissipated at the same time, a necessary sacrifice.</span>

Clearly it was not expecting that, but the adrenaline pumping through its nervous system let it recover quickly. It immediately decided to pounce on Vuko. 

But as it began its jump, the beast was broadsided by something dark. It crashed into the sandy dune with a spectacular spray of sediment, writhing and thrashing. Two dark-blue figures both about half the size of the cat assaulted it in the night.

The clamour of screeching and flapping grew louder and louder, filling the skies of the expansive desert around the Tenno. As the group reached the top of the dune, he spotted the distant glow of the drill station past many dune hills and slopes. The terrain wasn’t going to give them a straight run, but perhaps that was more advantageous for dealing with attackers. The only problem was that the drill station still sat at least a ten minute run away.

Or rather, not the only problem, since they also found ominous storm-clouds looming in the distance.~</span>

Hearing the thunderous claps of wings swirling around him only filled him with confidence that his decision to run was correct.

Knowing that he isn’t of much use on an open field with enemies in close range, Vuko didn’t even slow down in his run towards the drill. He even summoned his bow, Artemis, mid run as per Disruptis’ advice. 

To make his run shorter and gain a bit of mobility, he started shooting zip lines to connected the dunes. This should give him the ability to dodge an incoming air attack not only to the sides, but also downward, as well as make it easier to shoot and look further back as his path has already been set.</span>

He sighed and shrugged to the air before trudging behind the rest of the group, lazily watching the rest of his squad acrobatically advancing forward.

He was ready to protect and assault whoever or whatever dared threaten Vuko, but that didn’t seem to be needed as something far greater took out the feline. Talk about a brush with lady luck! The rust colored kubrow didn’t linger too long on the bloody display and simply kept by Vuko’s side. Even when the Ivara ziplined in to the air, he remained on the ground, running just bellow him, keeping in perfect synch with his friend. He eyed the air and the state of the dunes, and simply charged at it! he went up by the sheer power of his limbs and slid down on his - OOPS - he trips and rolls the rest of the way down in a show of spectacular derpy grace and fashion, meeting the level sand bellow head first like a ostrich. But he does not let that stop him and quickly pulls his head out, spits and snorts the particles from his nose before he kicks himself off in to a sprint, the sand imbedding in to his fur and brushing close to his eyes.</span>

In one moment, Isa saw him running ahead of her, and in the next, he was gone. All of the air in the Tenno’s lungs were punched out of him when he suddenly found himself flying through the crisp wind. He landed with a back-breaking blow and skipped across the sand.

Then Isa herself found a flying object, albeit slower, approaching her from behind.

A creature plucked Kapak out of his slide and threw him onto the opposite hill before he could react. It clamped down onto the sediment in front of his feet and <em>screeched</em>. In the dim light of the stars and his own headlamp, the Nidus witnessed a scaly beast that stood up to his neck. Long, leathery wings stretched into the night-lit desert on either side of it. Its vaguely alligatorinae head swung down to chomp Kapak’s head off.

Cev was lucky. While he was sliding, another one of the creatures took a pass at him but missed, barely scraping him with its claws. Then it proceeded to crash into the ground and tumble painfully down the hill, making panicked shrieking noises all the way.~</span>

Without a clue or strategy in mind he was getting a desperate. They were sitting ducks on an open field.

The Tenno continued on running along the zipline for a moment to get the time to draw her sword, then turned around, sliding a bit backwards from her own momentum before propelling herself in the opposite direction, toward the shadow that was previously behind her, her sword arm held across her body, ready to swing the Sentient blade in a wide arc in front of her just before impact. She knew she couldn&#39;t outrun this thing, so the most reasonable course of action was to kill it. 

Her kubrow had previously been bounding along behind Garhul. While tall, he was slim and graceful unlike the hulking beast that was Garhul. Spotting one of his allies in danger, Ordo began bounding toward Kapak to try to leap onto the creature assaulting him to assault with its claws and maw.</span>

<em>What a magnificent thing!</em> Kapak thought to himself, <em>So fast... so silent! Perhaps... tasty?</em>
In a flash, Kapak&#39;s two arms grabbed onto the scale-bound being&#39;s jaws, pushing backwards to stop its advance. He screeched, and three tendrils erupted from his chest, entering the monster&#39;s throat.

Out of the corner of his eye he spotted Ordo bounding towards the bird-like reptile to assist. Kapak couldn&#39;t help but hiss at the kubrow, as if he were an alpha predator defending his catch from wily scavengers.</span>

However, the Nidus proved to be no lightweight. He completely halted the creature’s advance and even reversed the situation, successfully feasting on its insides while all it could do was squirm.

When wielding a sword, often times velocity proved itself more important than the size or sharpness of a blade. Isa was given the opportunity to witness this once more as she swung at her pursuer. It tried to dodge to the side, but was much too late. The combined momentum of the weapon and the animal’s flight cleaved the thing half-way down its torso before launching it into the sands below. It was a satisfying moment.

But it didn’t last long.

The Saryn’s arms were grabbed with an iron-like grip, then she found herself hoisted into the air. Another akuul had snuck up on her from behind. It clamped its maw down onto her and attempted to rip away the sword-steel surrounding her neck with vicious intensity.

Cev’s opponent swiftly recovered itself and leaped to the side. About a quarter of his bullet-stream managed to tear its way into its hide, but that didn’t stop it. It bounded into his range and clamped down on his neck in the same way its kind had been doing to the other Tenno. Knocking Cev to the ground, its teeth found the grooves in his warframe’s armour, cutting into his flesh a little during the struggle to find a good position.

Vuko hadn’t lost his speedy assailant yet. A much larger akuul than his friends had dealt with blanketed the sky in front of him. He didn’t have any time to react as it lunged upon him with ferocity, digging talons into his sides. His armour barely held. Vuko was dragged across the sands on his back from the assault, all the while his intimidating foe roared.~</span>

Isa felt herself rising higher into the air than she had intended. These things were getting irritating now. Its teeth failed to penetrate through the combination of armor and shields of the Saryn. She thrust upward with her sword, plunging it into the creature repeatedly, occasionally swinging upwards to try to catch its wings with the blade.

With a fair bit of effort thanks to hitting the ground constantly, Vuko reached for the scindo on his back, while letting his bow dissipate into nothingness.

It shrieked and gurgled as a stream of blood brushed the Saryn’s back in crimson. Muscular claws relinquished their iron grip on her, and the two began a freefall from 200 meters in the air. Sand was supposed to be soft, right?

The alpha akuul jumped off of Vuko right as the axe touched its leg, allowing the swing only time to scrape at the beast. This wasn’t incredible reaction time though, but more a response to Garhul’s sturdy grip on it. The akuul cried out in pain and tried to shake the oversized kubrow off, to no avail. Instead it changed its tactic to attack. 

It sunk its teeth into Garhul’s sandy back.

The poor akuul’s head was brutally ripped apart. Kapak only received a split second to assess the situation with the other Tenno before another pair of wings crashed into him. They seemed unfearful of their friend’s terrible demise, but cautious. This time two of the winged menaces pinned each of his arms onto the cool dunes and peered down at his body, like they were waiting to see what he would do.~</span>

However, despite the agony, he remained latched on to the creature.

Two hundred feet. Three and a half seconds to impact. The firmness or softness of the sand wasn&#39;t really a concern with that point as the Tenno had plenty of time to react, orienting herself so she was falling chest first with her arms spread. About one second before impact she used a small amount of void energy to slow her fall and glide the rest of the way down, turning herself to land on her feet with ease. She would land with grace provided her fall wasn&#39;t interrupted by any more akuul, though she did keep her blade at the ready to take a swing at any that came for her.

Meanwhile, her kubrow had hesitated when Kapak hissed at him, though the second two other akuul beset the Nidus, he was midair, pouncing on one of the creatures that had latched onto his ally.</span>

With one hand free, Kapak turned towards the remaining akuul still perched on his right arm. He gave the organism a wicked smile before clenching his fist into a ball, the bony spike of a Hirudo&#39;s blade forming overtop the Nidus&#39; wrist. With one swift motion, he punched into the belly of the akuul three times with the intent of leaving a trio of hemorrhagic holes in the creature&#39;s main body.</span>

He managed to wiggle it out, then maxed the speakers built into his palms to funnel the sound into his mallet before shoving it into the creature’s mouth. The coms went silent as his music abruptly shut off. 

“Sorry mates,” was all that could be heard before a single deafening drum kick pulsed through the air as the mallet engaged.</span>

Red flooded his eyes as Vuko leapt into the air slightly above the creature, intent on chopping the weaseling things into little bits. With all the pent up anger, he aimed his axe at the base of its neck.

A moment after it, he heard what sounded like an over-bassed explosion, causing him to stagger, feeling all of his insides rumble, and grab the sides of his head. He momentarily started seeking the source of the sound, once recovered.</span>

Garhul was released as the akuul reared up, tearing the axe out of Vuko’s hands. It flailed helplessly with the weapon still embedded quite soundly, wailing into the night. 

Despite Isa’s cunning attempts to slow down, she hit the ground hard and fell over, losing her grip on her blade in the process. The akuul she expertly felled slammed into the ground next to her, sending a spray of sand onto her back. A couple more figures circled her in the air, but didn’t seem brave enough to make an immediate move after seeing her in action.

The akuul’s eyes went wide as dinner plates as Cev shoved a glowing sphere down its throat. Light illuminated its stomach, casting shadows of its veins across the dunes before a massive tremor rocked through its innards, tearing them into pieces at microscopic levels. It instinctively drew backwards to escape danger, but it was too late. Most of the bones in its body had been fractured, and the ones nearest to the sound wave were ground to powder. It fell over dead without a chance to even twitch.

Kapak’s enemy clearly wasn’t expecting the Nidus to grow a blade on his hand, so it screeched as the first stab caught it in a soft-spot in its tough carapace and leapt off him too. Its belly bled onto the dry desert sand as it regarded him. The other akuul pounced on Isa’s kubrow with intense ferocity, clamping its gigantic maw onto its neck and back, much like a cat picking up a young one but with more violent intent.</span>

She looked around, assessing the situation a moment before heading in the direction of her kubrow and Kapak, though she was rather confident Ordo could handle himself against the creature trying to pounce on him.

Ordo was circling around for another pounce as the akuul latched onto his back. He brought his forepaws up to try to claw away and push it off of him.</span>

The second akuul had seen enough. First its prey pulls a sharp object out of his mucking arm and then reaches inside his chest to retrieve yet another deadly weapon? It was smart enough to recognize what it was dealing with. Steeling itself to power through the pain of its gut, it turned away and leapt into the air.

Garhul was dragged across the sand like an over-sized garden rake. Vuko struggled up the akuul’s flailing back, but managed to hold on. The akuul him and reflexively slammed his back down onto the ground, knocking the wind out of the Tenno and bruising his stomach. The axe fell out, trailing dark-red blood through the night.~</span>

Isa reached her pet as Kapak moved in for the final blow on the akuul. If he wasn&#39;t able to kill it, she would follow up on it to try to simply cleave its wing off, a much larger and easier target than its head no doubt. Crippling it would be just as effective as  killing it, and far easier.

Ordo didn&#39;t hesitate with his attack either, the second he was released his jaws clamped around one of the creature&#39;s wings, holding it in place.</span>

Oh shet! The kubrow got dragged across the harsh and coarse sand that got everywhere under his fur, such a irritating thing. But HUZZAH! At the end of his struggle he came out of it with a chunk of flesh in his maw...along with a really hard barrel roll that send him tumbling a few meters away from the force. Under any other circumstances, the companion would have eaten the meat but this is no time for munching, it&#39;s a time for fighting!

Garhul spit the flesh from his mouth and swiftly got up on his paws, not even giving his fur a shake from the sand, or the fact that it got in to his opened wound causing a fresh wave of pain to ripple through him. No time for that either! He saw the creature about to body slam Vuko, causing a wave of panic and urgency to rush through him. The kubrow clenched his jaw, widened his stance, lowered his head and closed his eyes. The Raksa kubrows may not be ferocious like the Sunika, sneaky like the Huras, resourceful like the Sahasha or quick like the Chesa, but it possesses something deeper, a string that binds them to those worthy of their undying loyalty, a bond that lasts a lifetime and even beyond. Through this connection they aid their Tenno, they follow them, they protect them.

Garhul does just that, he boosts Vuko&#39;s shields - like a sudden spherical ball of energy around him - just before the Akuul slammed him down, absorbing most of the damage, transferring it to Garhul.</span>

“Oh I’m so done with yoouuuuu....” He screamed out as the Akuul was smashing him against the ground, his shout culminating in a loud <em>’thump’</em> that raised a good bit of sand around them. Surprisingly enough, Vuko felt barely any pain other than the impact knocking the wind out of his lungs. He knew where all the damage had gone however. Garhul. Turning his head instinctively towards his companion, he saw the fearless Kubrow taking the brunt of the damage onto his battered and bruised self.

‘This is far too dangerous.’ He thought to himself. ‘It’s one thing when I’m risking my own skin, but with Garhul standing in between me and damage, I’ll have to be more cautious.’ In line with those words, he bolted some meters away from the beast the second there was an opening, grabbing his axe along the way and swinging it back onto his back, and summoned his exalted bow once more. “You’re gonna regret hurting my friend.” Vuko said towards the bird the moment he let an arrow loose, putting in extra effort to ensure it lands in its glistening eyeball.</span>

The powerful arrow shot straight through the large akuul’s head and slammed into the sand on the other side. The creature was tossed to the ground by the impact, spraying one last wave of sand into the night air. It moved no more. 

With the final foe and leader felled, the rest of the akuul flapping their wings in the distance took off into the pale night. The breeze was lined with dust and sediment: a result of the parties’ struggles. Blood leaked out from the many slaughtered enemies to stain the sands with signs of combat. These dunes held no remorse, but would soon deal with the aftermath in its own way.

The Tenno observed the quiet night ambience trickle in once again.~</span>

That felt like a big SLAP as he felt the force transferred to him, his bruised body only getting more bruised but he doesn’t mind, it’s what he was trained for! When the beast got murdered by Vuko, the kubrow let out a mighty and gleeful bark, as if congratulating the Ivara on the kill, his one ear straightening up and his mouth gaping to let out some of the heat that has accumulated in his body.

He started walking towards Vuko but winced when he felt the coarse sand that got in to the opened wound between his shoulders rubbing and cutting inside, like hundred of tinny little nails. It’s really irritating! He let out a annoyed huff and tried to bend his neck to somehow lick it clean…but failing due to his own thickness and the position of the bleeding wound itself.</span>

Kapak tore the akuul’s brain from its cradle, lifting it over his head as he unleashed a bloodcurdling screech. He crushed the organ, showering himself in grey matter as blood flowed down his arm.
As Kapak licked his fingers clean, he jerked his head towards Vuko and Garhul. The scent of Kubrow blood permeated the air, and the Nidus soon found himself kneeling next to the bulky beast, weaving the laceration shut with one hand while he stroked his fur with the other.
“Vuko, you alright?” Kapak asked the Ivara without turning his head from his patient, “Isa, Cev, you guys alright too?”</span>

“This took way longer than necessary...” He said with a sigh of relief once the beast has finally fallen. Before he even had the chance to alert Kapak about the Kubrows state, the Nidus was already there, patching him up.

“I’m fine for the most part, focus on Garhul.” He said, sitting down on the sound, clearly exhausted by the fight. “Am I the only one who so much trouble with these muckers? I can’t be <em>that</em> rusty.”</span>

She said as she walked over to her Kubrow, inspecting his wounds. He was bleeding but things looked mostly superficial. He could go on without Kapak&#39;s healing for now. She gave him a pat on the head before turning to Vuko.
&quot;It looks like you had to deal with the largest one, probably the leader of the flock. I can see why the Grineer wouldn&#39;t try to cross the desert on foot, though I&#39;m still not sure what would prevent them flying over in dropships.

He let out a pleased huff as he felt someone tending to that pesky wound, the strokes calming down his nerves. The kubrow lifts his head to give the Nidus a chain of wet and slobbery licks on his cheek as a show of gratitude...meaty but this meaty taste is connected to a friend so he will not eat it.</span>

The Nidus nodded his head in silence, allowing Vuko to do the talking as he finished tending to Garhul&#39;s wounds. There! All better again. Kapak gave a chuckle as the kubrow&#39;s tongue slapped his face, before giving the bulky canine a head scratch.
&quot;Weirdass creatures,&quot; Kapak said as he strode over to Cev, &quot;I wonder if these were created by the Orokin like the rest of the things on this planet... or are they natural? Perhaps an evolution of ancient Orokin genetically modified organisms?&quot;
A fleshy tube with a toothed barb end extended from Kapak&#39;s side. He took it in his hand and stuck it unceremoniously into Cev&#39;s side. Kapak&#39;s own cells flooded the Warframe, quickly replenishing lost blood and closing the Octavia&#39;s neck wound.</span>

However after trying to activate his cloak, something went awry as Vuko clutched his side and flinched, no doubt the aftermath of the giant bird prying it’s claws inside him. Before the others had to say anything about it though, he performed the maneuver again, this time successfully, and started making his way towards the outpost unseen.</span>

~Vuko, Isa, Kapak, and Cev trudged through the sand uneventfully until they lifted their feet atop the final dune. From there, the desert quickly sloped downwards and levelled out to make room for the Grineer. A large deep-surface drill dominated the center of a community of buildings, slowly grinding away the midnight oil. Only low-level lights dared attempt to pierce the dimly star-lit night, as if the complex itself was wary of the desert it called home. Paint chips spattered across the outside of the structures’ walls retold the story of harsh desert winds alongside the usual husky-red propaganda art. 

Three towers anchored the whole fort’s presence into the sandy landscape—two ballista watch-posts and one thin device that looked more like a tall radio antenna. The details of the camp were obscured from the Tennos’ distance by a gigantic net covering the entire place with only the antenna in the middle to hold it up. Other than those three, there were four more buildings of indeterminable use.

The cool breeze continued to billow any cloth hanging from the groups&#39; bodies.~</span>

The Nidus knelt on one knee at the summit of the dune, careful to not send sand shifting down the slope towards the encampment. A Codex scanner materialized in his hand, which he brought to his eyeless skull.
&quot;Nothing out of the ordinary that I can see from here,&quot; Kapak mused as he looked over the buildings, &quot;No scanners or surveillance drones, no Akkalaks or Morddas, no Vruushes in case we need fast Archwing extraction...&quot;
Kapak hummed.
&quot;Seems rather unguarded. I guess they don&#39;t expect a Tenno-mounted raid. There&#39;s a Voiddamn net in the way of the view from here though, so I can&#39;t get a clear look. Oi, Cephalon! You still online? Make yourself useful and scan the camp for digital weakpoints, would you? Find any distress signal protocols or other crap.&quot;
Kapak lowered the scanner and turned to the others.
&quot;Well, we can do this the quiet way or the fun way. Vuko, I know you can take out the Ballistas in 2 seconds if need be, so we won&#39;t have to worry about Grineer taking <em>t&#39;teakit&#39;j</em> potshots at us if things get heated. I&#39;m mostly concerned if they can call in backup and before we know it, we have a Fomorian bombing us from orbit.&quot;</span>

He stood right of Vuko and went over the camp with his senses, by the order of how he perceives everything around him: 
Smell
Sound
Sight

Smell - the strongest of the senses in his arsenal, it guides him through life, it tells him when someone is frightened, when they&#39;re in a panic induced craze, where the food is at, it tracks his prey, it tells him when it will rain, where the enemy is, who is friendly, it keeps him living. And right now he wiggles his bended nose in the air, trying to absorb any smells coming from the camp, while he is a distance away from it you cannot overestimate the power of the desert wind that carries particles across the entire savannah. Be it sweat from the Grineer, or the putrid smell of machinery and oil, he inhales it all

Sound - after his nose is done sniffing, it&#39;s his ears - er well - ear - that come in to play. He rotates it in the general direction of where his nose is pointing him to. If there are smells coming from there then there also must be sounds that can paint a better picture in his head. Is it a big or small enemy, is it close to dying, is it tired, is it leafy in nature...questions and answers fill his head as his ear bounces from left to right.

Sight - colors to Garhul are duller than what other perceive, red and yellow shades are non existent and for this he doesn&#39;t rely on his eyesight as much. His nose picks up the world around him, his ears fleshes it out, and his eyes only guide him away from smacking in to obstacles. Still, he observes the camp, not understanding much of what he&#39;s seeing from this distance but he catches on to the Grineer, knowing that they are flesh he&#39;s allowed to chew.

To the gang around him, they will see the kubrow standing still and looking at  the camp, only his nose and ear wiggling, redirecting and refocusing. The breeze caresses his crimson fur, like a cold yet comforting touch.</span>

&quot;Mmmhm? What? Oh, sorry, too many card-games at the same time, had to tone it down a little on the betting side. Now, lets see...&quot;
<em>It all was code for him. Strings of it flying through the datascape. But where his own was enormous in its size, others were less liberating. Most of the hardware outside the Spire was...lackluster compared to his own, due to hundreds of years of technological stagnation and more often than not connecting to something like someone else&#39;s Orbiter, landing craft or any other device was like getting imprisoned in a room with a door and a window of thick glass. Unpleasant.

Thank Himarius this particular device had a hole in the glass.
He looks through, searching  for any outgoing signal, or any place/piece of tech that could allow such a thing.</em></span>

The Ivara crouched down next to the Nidus, silent and keen on what he had to say. As the news of the low level of security was flowing in, he hummed in approval for each piece. “Hmm.. yes.. I agree Kappy. We don’t know how many reinforcements they have available. So as to whether stealth or fun, I say why not both?”

He stepped back from the peak, calling everyone to gather in a circle.
Vuko bent down low on one knee, and began a rough sketch of the area they’re about to infiltrate with his finger. “Since this is a small outpost, they shouldn’t have more than one transmitter tower.” 
He began a line from their current position to the antenna. “Kapak and Isa, you two will head straight for the radio and put it out of commission, while I cover you from up here. I trust given enough time you can use your infestation to tear it down, Kapak. If that does not work or you get spotted, Isa’s got heavy ordinance.” He looked at the Saryn, knowing she’d really enjoy the latter.

“While you two are busy taking down their communications.” He began drawing another line, this time curved, heading around the watchtowers, straight into the heart of the camp. “Cev and I will sneak inside, and attempt to capture an asset valid for intel extraction. Probably a commander or some other high ranking bastard.”

Vuko finished the sketch by marking a big ‘X’ in the middle of the camp where the drill is. “This is our rendezvous point if all goes to shit. It should be an easily defensible position as the grineer should be scared of shooting at it in fear of damaging their precious equipment or blowing it up by accident. And if we get pinned down... like I said, it’s highly combustible.” He finished up with a tone that is the equivalent of a cheeky wink.

“Do you see any flaws in my plan, cephalon?” He asked, making sure that there isn’t some pertinent information Elo found.</span>

The Saryn quietly stood behind Vuko, looking over his Ivara&#39;s shoulder as he drew in the sand. She wouldn&#39;t particularly enjoy destroying the transmitter, but was certainly equipped to do so. &quot;I can manage if Kapak&#39;s infestation fails. I could stay outside near the walls if you take out the lookouts and jump in if needed. Stealth is not my strong suit, and as such it would be best to use me as a contingency if things go wrong.&quot;

She turned to her kubrow. &quot;Ordo, heel.&quot; The tall yet lean kubrow walked over to stand beside her. &quot;My kubrow should be able to keep me cloaked for an approach. But I doubt he will manage to get me all the way to a tower.&quot;</span>

It was resting in Cev’s possession as Elo ran his scans. He reached out with invisible fishing lines, catching the middle of electronic Grineer transmissions through the air. He sniffed a strange signal in the midst of the sea of data he was working on decoding.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
“Okay, game time.” Disruptis announced, readjusting his transmitter. “Just before you head in, let me let you in on the down-low for the security in this thing. First of--”

~Three seconds into Elo’s scan and mid-way through Disruptis’s sentence, it hit.

A wave of terrible interference.

Everything fizzed out at once. Each of the Tenno were cut off from communication with the outside world with an ear-grinding electronic screech. Disruptis’s channel vanished, connection to cephalons vanished, even comms between the Tenno turned fuzzy, though not unusable. Elo’s mind operating in milli-seconds, he found himself with a split-second decision: keep an instance of himself running inside the beacon, or disconnect entirely and separate himself from the squadron. In the meantime, deadly abnormal interference leapt up the connection and right into his databanks, corrupting bits left and right.

Everyone noticed a slight physical force pushing them back, as if they could actually feel the interference itself. It was most likely something they had never experienced before. Ordo and Garhul suffered minor migraines from it, distracting them from their initial surveillance. Even the maggots squirming inside of Kapak’s chest felt a little of it. 

The camp, on the other hand, looked unchanged.~</span>

A Cepahlon split in two was nothing. There were always copies. But to Elo...that felt like he got his limb chopped off. The fact that he had to do so willingly only sprinkled more salt on the wound. And the fact that the wound was now infected with some sort infection was the cherry on top. While sparing most of the Spire&#39;s processing power to contain and repair the damage, he opened a private secured comm-link with Disruptis. 

&quot;Fathermucker...Dis, we have a problem. Connection lost and whatever it is that caused it - my software just went haywire. The bastarding byte got inside, I&#39;m containing the damage as we speak but until those on land find and disable whatever caused it I&#39;m not going back there. Also, next time we use Spire-made transmitter. With failsafes. Gonna set up an order with Sylvianna.&quot;

Unless they are periodically activating this they likely already know we&#39;re here.&quot; She took her hand off of Ordo&#39;s head to grip her Zarr again and looked to Vuko. &quot;We could wait to see if this turns off, but if it doesn&#39;t an all-out assault may be in order.&quot;</span>

The Nidus couldn&#39;t help but grin at the sound of his old nickname parting from Vuko&#39;s lips. Maybe things could return to normal after all? No matter- the time to make a Grineer smoothie was nigh. The bizarre sensation and screech washed over Kapak, throwing a falter into his mood, but he quickly brushed it off. Perhaps masked by his hunger...? Kapak&#39;s belly rumbled- not loud enough for the others to hear, but certainly strong enough for the Nidus to feel.
&quot;That was weird... no matter! Disruptis?&quot; he paused for a moment, frowning as he tried to listen for the end of Disruptis&#39; sentence, which never came. He shrugged. &quot;Looks like we have our plan then- sneak in, get this <em>keykit&#39;j</em> cephalon all up in they circuits &#39;n then wipe the floor with their dumbass, turtle looking clone bodies.&quot;
Kapak&#39;s Codex scanner disappeared as his hand formed a thumbs-up to compliment his toothy smirk.
&quot;How&#39;s that sound?&quot;</span>

The transference shaved a couple decibels off Disruptis’s hearing before frying the whole earpiece, causing sparks to leap into his ears.

“AAAAAAAGH!” He cried out in anguish, ripping it out. The operator’s face contorted in a flash of pain. He took a couple moments to walk it off and promptly slam a fist onto the planning table. It took a few more to get his bearings.

<em>What the muck was that?</em>

He regarded his broken comms unit in disbelief. That thing should’ve been perfectly fine against their scramblers. Either he had mucked something up in the development process or something changed. <em>Whatever,</em> he told himself, <em>I uploaded schematics to the Spire’s database, so they should be fine.</em>

He started to walk outside for some fresh air, but froze on his second step.

<em>Wait, am I stranded here with no comms now?</em></span>

“Muck!” He screamed out, as quietly as he could as the piercing sound reached his head. It took him a good few seconds to manually recalibrate his receiver into hearing range, but he managed to get it in time to understand the jist of what everyone said.

“Cephalon - good idea. Isa - no, we stick to the plan. Just stick the beacon onto the tower first. The drill should give us additional cover.”

Ivara summoned the bow into its hands once again, stretching from the huddled position into a proper firing position, observing the tower and pondering the distance and wind that an arrow would have to travel to reach it. He was considering trying to take out the lookouts all the way from here, but ultimately decided against it. It could go wrong one too many ways.

Isa gave a curt nod when asked if she was ready, then once Kapak seemed ready she bolted down toward her target, gaining momentum with a few steps before starting to slide.

The Nidus flashed one more grin before bounding down the slope after Isa, galloping on all fours like some kind of aberrated beast- a sure sign that Kapak&#39;s hunger was growing. Looks like the Nidus had been saving his appetite for this event.
The air was rank with smells- Ordo&#39;s skin cells, the grease of Grineer machinery, clone blood and sweat, dried out drahk dung, feather oil from condroc feathers... a delectable aroma to Kapak.

The “net” held big enough holes to easily slip through, and seemed to have no alternate effects tapered on. It certainly wasn’t giving up its purpose to any visitor from mere inspection.

The large ballista tower they passed under showed no signs of stir. Anyone with a good eye could make out the sight of many Akklak, Morda, and Vruush turrets lining its inside and outside. They carefully swiveled around: relaxed, yet cautious. The station was armed to the teeth, and with no small amount of hands to work it. At least ten Grineer troops manned the upper platform, scraping the fresh-blown sand out of its armaments with old rags. They had probably been up there all day.

As for the base itself, it was as expected. Not one sole of a boot disturbed the night sands. All were crammed in buildings or burning the drill’s midnight oil.~</span>

“Mmmm (&gt;.&lt;).” Elo was forced to transmit with an MTU of five hundred. Five hundred was very low for cephalon standards, which told a tale in of itself. This made XerAI seem quite lethargic. 

The cephalon pulled her conversation partner’s user ID and tried to match it with something from what parts of her database that she still had access to. Her search failed.

Seeing as the whole thing was progressing at snails pace, he switched to the basest of his speech forms just to make it easier...for both of them.
&quot;Cephalon ELO. Designation: Main Cephalon of the Orokin R&amp;D Facility, codename Charred Spire. First encounter with Cephalon XerAi: Approximately 10 Solar Years ago. Reason: Meeting with Cephalon&#39;s designated Operator: Disruptis. You saved me.&quot;
<em>He took a pause, giving XerAi time to process the information provided. He couldn&#39;t just send in a scanning operation into her systems, it would be impolite. Maybe she was just waking up after a long period of inactivity? What was she doing there? Where even was that &quot;there&quot;?</em>
&quot;Was working with Disruptis on a mission. Lost contact 1 minute ago. Cause: Unknown interference. Attempts at reconnection: unsuccessful at all channels. Extrapolation: Disruptis lost all communication devices. Taking into consideration that he&#39;s not with you yet, nor attempted to contact me - conclusion: He is an idiot without any means of communications or transportation. Stranded. I possess information of his locations. Requesting a landing craft.&quot;</span>

The Nidus slithered across the sand and flecks of rust, carefully creeping like a kubrodon on the hunt over the smaller Grineer machinery.
Kapak paused at the base of the Ballista tower, leaning his invisible head upwards as if he could gaze at the Grineer through the floor.
He looked around, and saw the three cables supporting the tower. An unseen smile spread across his face.
“Vuko,” Kapak called one a hushed voice over the local comms, “you remember when we first met?”</span>

A couple engineers were working away on the various parts of the drill. Tiers of walkways surrounded some of the more vital components, but much of the workers seemed to be inside sheltered alcoves attached onto it.

Kapak could see that the cables supporting the structure seemed only necessary for holding down the mesh on top of it. This wasn’t an ordinary ballista tower. It had a much wider “pole” that looked big enough to hold rooms inside. It would probably take a little more to fell it than he initially expected.

The gentle desert breeze picked up. It grew quite strong, and started grabbing the sand off the ground and tossing it to knee-height in the air. At least the group didn’t have to worry about making small noises now with the wind screaming through their ears.~</span>

Kapak looked at the ground which he&#39;d covered, noticing his footprints. Quickly, he launched two long tendril from his thigh which struck the ground, wriggling quickly to displace sand and muddle the tracks.
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Kapak transmitted back, &quot;I already did! I ALWAYS make sure my tracks are covered!&quot;
Kapak ran his hands along the Ballista tower&#39;s base, lightly drumming his fingers to the beat of Cev&#39;s music. &quot;I just brought up the &#39;good &#39;ol times&#39; because... well, you remember how well that Ballista tower crumbled in response to your Void beam severing its cables. Although, this one looks a bit sturdier. Still no sound from Disruptis?&quot;
Kapak&#39;s fingers seized up suddenly, digging into the metal base of the tower. It was enough to create a decent sized deformity without compromising the tower&#39;s structural integrity.
His belly gurgled as his hunger grew.
<em>I should&#39;ve had a snack before we headed out,</em> he thought, <em>maybe there&#39;s some grokdrul nearby I can slurp up or something. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s something inside the base of this ballista tower!</em>
Kapak carefully inched his way around the base of the structure until he found something.</span>

 XerAI was only ever really in one place, but she and Disruptis decided that it should be mostly kept secret. This wasn’t an easy place to come to.

While speaking Vuko&#39;s mind was not really there, which could be heard from his monotone voice. His mind was racing and predicting different probabilities on how his encounter might end depending, on which alcove he chooses, all with the goal of finding the best one to capture one of the engineers.</span>

She paused as she watch Kapak start digging into the base of the tower before making his way to the door. The only response from Vuko was a playful jab. It seemed like they were going in after all. She crept along the tower beside Kapak, waiting for him to go in first. She would follow up to make sure they were able to quickly dispatch any opposition. Thankfully the windstorm would cover their tracks and likely any noise of battle, provided there weren&#39;t any gunshots.</span>

They sat in harnesses suspended from the top of the drill’s roof. Other than that, there were three alcoves he could make out. One had a flashing light inside, like the sparking of a welder, while the others held consistent luminescence. No one was moving outside amidst the clouds of dust rising from the ground.

<em>CHINK.</em> The door clunked open, welcoming all the airborne sand into its recesses. The inside was mostly a storage unit, holding munitions for the many arms that blanketed the tower. Directly across the room was a gigantic monitor attached to the wall. It’s dull-yellow screen shone on a Grineer ballista trooper sitting on a chair right in front of it, working away. She hadn’t moved when the door opened. To the right was a ladder leading to a closed access hatch to the floor above.~</span>

See that dangling grineer?” He pointed at the engineer suspended on a harness closest to them. “I could cloak, zip-line next to him, jab him with a sleep arrow and then toss him to you below.

The Nidus turned to Isa, putting a finger to his mouth to signal silence.
He crawled across the floor, silently creeping forward until he was right behind her back. Assuming he was successful, he would extend a mass of tendrils from his chest, wrapping tightly around the Ballista&#39;s neck and arms. He would try to constrict with such force that the metal armour on the Grineer itself would bend and dent under the strain.</span>

He could send his own people...no, that would raise questions. Better stick with the proposed plan, than open the cards to early.

He opens the &quot;dusty&quot; channel gateway, connecting himself to the space-station somewhere in the Origin System.

Agh Tok squinted her eyes at the warm, yellow screen in front of her. Every thirty minutes she wrote a survey report and sent it off to command. Her vat-sister Kek Tok would review it and send her back an acknowledgement, or request further information. This is the way it had been her entire post, unless a monster of the desert actually managed to attack the net. She was about to send her another report.

But she had still yet to hear back from the last one.

Protocol is protocol, though. Agh Tok shoved the thought out of her mind and slammed an armoured finger on send. If they didn’t respond to the next one, she’d give them a call.

Or not.

~Kapak’s maneuver easily succeeded, catching the ballista by surprise. Her fight or flight response couldn’t even kick in before Kapak executed a deadly squeeze, crushing the plating on her neck and strangling her.~</span>

Active nearly spat a stream of processing data into main memory.

“Cephalon Elo?!?!” She exclaimed in a speedy reply message. It had been 2.3926 years since she had anything to do with that name. The legendary figure was renown within her Abnormality Response Initiative cell as one of if not the greatest cephalon to ever process an integer. Active’s X-shaped fractal of a digital persona stared at the connection inside her CPU with reverence.

“This is Active, if you remember me. Which you might not. But…” Active metaphorically bit down on her tongue. “Uh-- nevermind! How is the current situation where Disruptis is stranded?”</span>

&quot;I do. Hello there, Active, nice to hear from you again.&quot;- he sent over, being nice to the young one.
Elo was the last Cephalon he would expect to experience memory problems. Everything was catalogued and hidden in his memory banks under close supervision of hundreds of thousands maintenance drones and other digital safety nets. Elo had to admit that he was going the paranoid way with his self-preservation. But everyone on the Spire understood that if he, the Core Cephalon of the entire facility, suffers even a minor fault - the whole thing might just go and kiss the sun. Literally.
&quot;I dont really know, he seemed like he was not in any immediate danger but...no one&#39;s gonna get him out of there. Unless the group that was with him decides to go back for some reason, he is effectively on his own with zero means of communication... So yeah, knowing him - its not good. At all. Better send someone in.&quot;</span>

The Nidus lifted the body up, watching a few trails of blood snake their way down from the sundered armour.
With his other hand, he gripped the shoulder of the Ballista, pulling hard to separate the head from the body. He tossed the head to the side before beginning to slurp up the innards from the Grineer&#39;s gaping wound.
&quot;Ohhhh... I needed this.&quot; Kapak hummed with pleasure in between bloody bites. Once he&#39;d eaten his fill, he tossed the body to the side and remained in place, watching the door so that Isa could investigate the rest of the structure without anyone sneaking up.</span>

With the Ballista dealt with, Isa climbed down from the ladder. Kapak had been quiet enough to not alert the ones up top it seemed.
&quot;Finished? We should move on. Our priority is taking out their communications.&quot;
She took a brief look around. Since they were here it wouldn&#39;t hurt to survey the inside of the tower quickly. Hopefully no one manning the top of the tower would come in any time soon to. Still, to be a bit safer she walked up to the discarded body of the ballista and picked it up, carrying it over to wherever the best spot was to hide it, then put it down, keeping her hands on it a moment and channeling her frame&#39;s corrosive abilities, quickly dissolving the corpse. Hopefully if anyone came in they wouldn&#39;t worry about the missing ballista.</span>

She wrote up a letter concerning the details and shot it off to resources with the number 73 in the header tag, referencing the ‘retrieve Disruptis again’ request category.

Vuko’s arrow gave a small <em>pink</em> as it wedged itself into the pole. The Grineer engineer jumped in fright. To him that sound was either something breaking inside the drill, which would mean more work, or it was the sound of something far sinister. The latter proved true when he whipped around just in time to see a hulking Ivara jab him with another arrow.

Warm light dimly glowed from behind a series of thick windows about two meters off the ground, but on the west side of the building there was nothing but wall, obscuring them from any other prying eyes. The worker’s heavy eyelids twitched as he started to rouse just as Cev leaned him against the wall.

The desert wind continued ferociously around them.~</span>

“Uh… T-tenno sko--,” he clambered for words, spitting out a mouthful of sand that had made its way into his mouth from the torrential sandstorm. He recognized the situation he was in, and silently thanked the Kweens that he had to learn a bit of Orokin to fill his job description. In somewhat broken and unpracticed Orokin, he responded.

“B-big boss is Gow. He in big building with bigger boss Mok.”

The Grineer was practically shaking with fear.</span>

Vuko and Cev made their way around to the south side of the biggest building they could see. Visibility was so low at this point that the tops of the drill and antenna disappeared into a sandy hue. The moon and starlight that previously had well illuminated the night struggled to provide anything more than a dim light now.

There was a single entrance in the form of a large door on this side. Small windows that more resembled port-holes fitted its outer walls. Three Arid grineer lancers sat amongst a series of large, black boxes about twenty meters away from it. Their backs were turned to the two Tenno as they watched the swirling sandstorm right outside the net.~</span>

While Grineer Ballistas could at times be quite deadly, they were of course snipers. Close range combat was far from their forte, and Isa demonstrated such with ease as she burst forth from the hatch onto the roof, as she fell down from her jump she cleaved the head off of one of them before leaping toward a second to make an upward slash, slicing up through her chest and throat, not bisecting her, but certainly killing her with that swing. The remaining two had turned to face her as she moved in on her third victim. This time the sentient blade swung high, cutting the sniper&#39;s throat, Isa spinning and crouching down on the follow-through of her swing to turn and face the final Grineer. With a push of her leading foot she gave one more leap forward and gave this one a cleave clean through the chest. She collided with the upper half of the ballista, kicking it into the netting around the top of the tower, using it to slow herself enough that she was able to land on the tower rather than leaping off of it. She took one quick look around and then seeing no more hostiles in the immediate vicinity she speaks over the comms. &quot;Ballista tower cleared.&quot;</span>

Isa stumbled and a cloud of sand flew up from the ground, obscuring the Tenno’s vision even more. When the dust settled, Isa was left standing on the broad side of the fallen tower. At the base of the tower, just outside its fallen entrance door, Isa could see four evenly cut pieces of Kapak’s body lying on the sand, along with many different bits of his head smudged across a two meter trail from them. It didn&#39;t look like he was in the way of the falling tower at all though.

She began to feel a small headache come over her.~</span>

The full drill soon emerged into her view. It stood silent and sullen, a mood that matched the relatively soundless night amidst the desert ambience. Only a very faint whirring and clicking came from the drill’s small, distant mechanisms. Isa’s vision failed to capture anything past the back half of the other buildings flanking the encampment on all sides, one of them Cev and Vuko supposedly snuck off to. It was eerily quiet.

For a split-second, Isa felt something move beneath her feet. Before she had a chance to react, something burst from the sands and pounced on her, knocking her to the ground and pinning her with an incredible strength she couldn’t match.

Isa found herself face-to-face with a humanoid creature resembling a woman with an hourglass figure whose body was formed of infestation and bits of chitin. On her back sat a large abdomen with six deadly spider-like appendages. Her face, lacking all features except two luminescent cyan eyes, came close to Isa’s, as if inspecting her.~</span>

“I believed the Disruptis was the only one who would think to embellish such a gaudy colour onto a warframe,” a high-pitched, raspy voice reverberated through Isa’s very mind, “apparently not. But don’t act oblivious with me now, I know you are with him.”

I have a counteroffer. You tell me your relation to and plans for Disruptis, and I will give you his last known location.&quot;</span>

The only facial expressions the infested woman could make were to do with her eyes, making it usually very difficult to get a read on her. Isa could clearly see the upturned eyes converting an invisible smile, however.

“Oh? You misunderstand. I’m not allowing you to leave your warframe any time soon.”

A hollow rattling noise started from inside the abdomen-like part of her anatomy, and a field of nullification energy spread over the Saryn, sealing not only her warframe powers, but her ability to use or cut transference.

“I’m not disclosing my plans for him here. He’s too crafty for that. I will, however, indulge your curiosity if it means I finish here sooner. I am the Weaver. Disruptis and I go way back, and he’s been quite the mischievous child as of late.”</span>

The Weaver let out what seemed like a long sigh.

“I was afraid I might need a hostage to draw him out, looks like that is the case after all,” she murmured.

~Isa watched as a small blue light flashed in the distance for a second, then the sound of an opticor being discharged blasted through the sandy air, along with an accompanying beam placed right in the Weaver’s back. <em><strong>KABOOM</strong></em>. The shield around her flickered again in an attempt to block the blow, which it managed in mostly succeeding before it shattered.

The Weaver flung Isa to the side, freeing her from the nullification, and turned to the source of the blast to find three grenades a split-second from hitting her face. Her appendages flew out and skewered each one, rendering them useless.

When the dust settled, a black and yellow limbo armed to the teeth was standing a couple meters away from them, charging another shot from his opticor.~

<strong>Weaver</strong>:
The Weaver flexed her talon-like hands. “Oh hello, Disruptis.”

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis stared the Weaver down.

“Hey, sis.”</span>

Disruptis led Isa to the other side of one of the buildings where a heavily armoured grineer transport vehicle was waiting. He leapt into the driver’s seat which was a mess of pre-jacked wires ready for hijacking. The Limbo ignited the engines and revved the engines.

“How much power do you have left for your warframe abilities, Isa?” He blurted.</span>

“Void, that’s a good boy,” Disruptis remarked before placing a hand on Isa’s stomach. With a familiar whooshing sound, the rift surrounded her once more. Disruptis then floored the pedal, and they lurched through the swirling sands.

“Ideally? Nowhere. Wasn’t even aware she was at a point where she cared about me. It’d make more sense if she tried to jump me in space during travel though, I don’t know why it was here. Or maybe that’s exactly why it was here. Dunno, she’s crafty.”

Their transport rocketed up the first dune. They didn’t have enough vision to tell how close the Weaver was to their tail, but that specter probably didn’t last long.

“Get ready, driving a big truck through this desert is going to get us some real bad attention, though we shouldn’t have to worry about sky-bound bogies with this sandstorm. I’m still recovering, so I can&#39;t use much of my power.”</span>

My guess is Weaver did something sly to change that.”

Sure enough, as they left the base, Isa found her connection to the outside had come back up again.

“Probably originally a trap for me, but she didn’t know I was staying behind somehow. Something’s fishy. After I lost you guys, I had a bad feeling in my gut and followed. Almost got myself killed!”

Disruptis finished that sentence with a half-laugh, half-cough that devolved into a hacking cough. His hands fumbled at the wheel.

“Oh yeah, I checked. The others are gone too,” Disruptis informed her. The vehicle lurched to the left as they ran over a bump in the sand.

“One’s waiting on the outskirts of Kawamo; we have to get out of this desert first.”

~As Disruptis was finishing his sentence, Isa saw a silhouette pull into view. A feline creature like the one she spotted near the exit of the Strait was chasing after their vehicle and gaining. It bared its fangs, which looked to be made of metal rather than calcium. Another one of the creature emerged just a couple meters behind it.~</span>

As it fell out of view, the transport flew over the crest of a dune, forcing Isa to grab hold of something as it smashed into the ground on the other side. Disruptis kept the pedal to the metal.

The sandstorm slowly thinned until the two Tenno regained most of their vision. They were now outrunning the storm by a slim margin. They approached the strait once again, and just when they thought they were scott free, a gigantic centipede slightly larger in width than the vehicle they drove bearing a steel carapace darted forth from the rolling sandcloud behind them. Atop its back, of course, rode the Weaver.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis caught the sight while glancing at a side-view mirror performed a massive double-take.

“UHHHH what in the muck is that?!” he exclaimed.

Disruptis thought he could see a glimpse of the awaiting landing craft on the far horizon. If they wanted to get out of here safely, they needed to at least slow their pursuers.

“Hey Isa! We gotta put some distance in between us and <em>that</em>. Any bright ideas?”</span>

She flicked the switch on her Zarr and fired a shot at it.

&quot;I will continue firing explosives. They may be distracted trying to avoid them. If the Waver isn&#39;t sustaining her nullification field, you could try banishing it and putting it into stasis.&quot;</span>

Half a kilometer off the strait hovered an orange-yellow and light purple painted scimitar with white highlights. The landing ramp was already lowered and waiting.~

The overgrown centipede was hit on both sides, halting its momentum. It squirmed and screeched as rows and rows of teeth adapted to carving through the naturally occurring metal protection of the creatures in this desert drilled into it. The Weaver was flung off her ride and onto the sands.

That was the last thing Isa saw of the commotion before not long after, a worm toppled their ride as well. Disruptis was flung out of the driver’s seat for not wearing a seatbelt, and Isa was tossed to the sand with him. The Limbo tumbled until coming to a stop. With more delay than he’d like, Disruptis dug his elbows into the sand and brought himself to stand once again. They were less than 100 meters off from the landing craft. The end was finally in their sights.

Disruptis turned to make sure Isa got up. Before turning to sprint the remaining distance.~</span>

The landing ramp closed and Disruptis sprawled himself across the codex module. The inside of his orbiter was a jungle of disconnected cables and wires dangling from the ceiling and spread over the floor, as if it was in an eternal state of restructuring.~

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
“Coal, get us out of here, please,” Disruptis grunted.

A lean, indiscriminate mound of black goop with a white mask that slowly dripped viscous liquid darkness into a cavity in place of the navigation module where it sat responded to his words. It turned back to the viewport, small tendrils raising themselves up like tiny little hairs all over its sides, and the window lit up with a holographic display. Dozens of diagrams, figures, and numbers popped to life along the glass as the ship rumbled forward.</span>

Disruptis didn’t move. 

As his muscles relaxed, his mind absorbed the outcome he was now presented with. The problem with Kawamo had gotten no closer to being resolved. His friends were fractured and dissonant, and the first mission they went on ended up in three of them being killed, albeit not permanently. The mission still ended in utter failure, and did not manage to bolster any spirits. Yet another failure. It had been a long time since the Tenno had seen a measure of success in his life. He wasn’t ever one to be easily discouraged by any means--it was one of the things that made him stand out in the Old War--but even he could only take so much.

Oh yeah, and now Weaver was looking for him.

“Y-yeah,” Disruptis eventually blurted in a weakened tone, “let me take you to your orbiter, Isa. Where is it right now?”

The scimitar broke through Earth’s atmosphere and the yawning expanse of space enveloped the viewport. Disruptis lethargically sat up in the chair of his codex module to chart their course for Coal to use, only to find bitter tears running down his face. He put a hand to his face to wipe them but realized he was still in his warframe. He didn&#39;t fully understand why he was crying in the swamp of emotions that swam in his head, but it felt right. He let the tears run off his cheeks, helpless to stop them, and set about his task.</span>

“Lekalis? No, just you guys. I have no idea where that Strider is or what he’s up to.” He punched the coordinates in, then it hit him.

“Wait, Lekalis is still alive?!?! Kapak told me you, him, and Cev were the only ones left!” The Tenno exclaimed.</span>

Disruptis let out a long breath. He stiffly rose to his feet and walked to the left viewport.

“Weaver is a human from the Orokin era who was involved in a certain Void related accident. An actual one, not your typical Orokin ‘accident’. Ended up both infested and changed by the Void to some degree. You won’t have to worry about her though; she doesn’t care about you and there’s probably a thousand ways she can get at me without worrying about you, as long as you aren’t in her way.”

The Limbo paused for a moment, placing a balled fist on the reinforced glass pane.

“Either way I’m going to have to settle something with her.”</span>

<em>Did you think I called you as a client and not an ally?</em> Disruptis completed the thought in his head, opting to cut himself off from speaking it. Isa could be hard to read, but here he had completely misunderstood her.

<em>Oh, the Remnant family didn’t mean anything to you Isa, did it? You just saw them as a means to an end.</em>

“Right,” Disruptis coughed, “I’ll let you know more about the Sentient if I find out more. I wouldn’t hold your breath for anything soon though, since I have to deal with the Weaver first. Unless the Weaver had ties to it.”

The Limbo clutched his head. “Oh muck that’d be bad, but also there’s no way she’d do that. I think.”</span>

That comment bit hard into Disruptis’s mind, digging its way to his very Oro. He shuddered for a moment and leaned into his own comms to try to respond to Kapak. 

“Hey Kappa are you okay? Hello?”

He waited a couple moments, but no response came. He cursed under his breath and turned back to Isa.

“Look. If trust with you is built off the back of success and not on someone’s character, I can’t say you’ll ever see me as an ally.”

~Coal took a viscous appendage and sent a docking request to Isa’s orbiter in order to allow her to easily walk down the ramp.~</span>

“I know that’s what you meant,” Disruptis shot back, crossing his arms, “my point is I’m far from a perfect person. If I was, what happened back on this very Exosphere would’ve never happened, and half my new friends would still be alive. If I was, I would’ve been able to easily see through Weaver’s calculated movements. If I was, I wouldn’t have lost my best friend from the Old War. If I was, I wouldn’t be a mucking half--”

Disruptis bit his tongue and steeled his frustration. It wasn&#39;t even particularly aimed at Isa, but more at himself. He clenched his fists and drew a deep breath.

“Let me cut that expectation right now. I don’t know who you’ve met in your life that you model this after, but I can’t be them. I’m a mucking idiot that’s part of so much mucked up stuff I can’t keep my head straight, but if I had it any other way, I’d be dead. Maybe I <em>should</em> just be dead.”

The Limbo whipped around and splayed his arms apart. “I mean what is the mucking POINT anymore?!”

~Coal brought the Scimitar down on Isa’s orbiter. The landing ramp peeled back with a hiss, revealing the interior of her ship.~</span>

&quot;Well... at least you admit your flaws. Work on improving them and know that I am still willing to work with you, for a fee. Both the Weaver and this Sentient have intrigued me. Send me the whole story to look over when you can. And remember, a fee need not be paid with credits. Many alternative goods and currencies exist in this system, I&#39;m sure we can work something out.&quot;
She gestured to her Kubrow who stood up and bounded down the ramp onto her orbiter.

&quot;And as for the point... there is none. None of us exist for a reason. It is up to you to make one for yourself. Keep in touch. Figure out what you want and I&#39;ll be around. You may be a magnet for misfortune, but you at least attract interesting misfortune.&quot;
She started to depart down the ramp, but would pause if Disruptis had anything else to say to her.</span>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis collapsed onto the floor, scar pains still throbbing from all his activity. He stared listlessly at the ceiling of his landing craft, past the hanging cords and tubes. He lay there for a couple minutes, just thinking. The humming of the ship and the small splashes of Coal filled the silence in his ears.

“Coal,” he eventually uttered, “take me to the Pyre.”</span>
