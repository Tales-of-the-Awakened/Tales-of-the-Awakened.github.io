The man in the yellow bowler hat. Now I’m sure you have many questions and… oH, ISA PLEASE DON’T SHUT THIS OFF I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME OUT!!! I would’ve liked to have a reunion but I’ve got my hands tied behind my back, so I thought I’d kill to birds with one stone and ask you all to help me out as well. I don’t know for sure what... state you are all in at the moment but I’m treading on ice so thin I can see the sharks swimming below me. Something very important is being attacked, and everything’s going to the Void if I don’t do something about it. So… come. Please. I need your help again, Kapak. Ella. Lekalis. Kuve. Devros. Muro. Orokino. Vuko. M...Mataeru? Muck. I’ll explain everything slowly whe-- if, you get here. If you can spread the message to the others, that’d be great. I can’t contact any of you anymore, not even Cev, but I have another way to reach out to him. I kinda… lost my mailing addresses. It’s complicated. The coordinates are in this message, but you may need to keep checking them in case it changes. Hopefully I’ll see you soon.”</div>

Pink petals slowly drifted through the afternoon breeze.

The surface of a swirling river below caught them delicately at first, then violently churned them into its flowing current. The floating petals packed the air around the river, offering one of the most beautiful sights the entire Origin system could show. It was still very hot, but the dry air permitted shade of any sort to be very cool and comforting. 

People were taking advantage of the shadows too. Villagers, who lived upon the great islands between the massive stream for decades, if not centuries. Wooden bridges stretched far across the gap, connecting the civilization to its mainland. However, despite the lushness of the river banks, only a scorching desert lay beyond.

A gigantic ‘X’ lay in the yellow sand just outside a colony bridge. It was created with a few dozen, or dare I say even hundred, rolls of non reflective black tape, almost comically too. This was the designated spot for a reunion of not only the living but the dead as well, and it ecstatically awaited its recipients.</span>

As the ship passed over the spot, one might have been able to observe that the ship was in terrible condition- covered in dents, its hull warped and scratched, paint job flaking off so much that some pieces of colour floated down across the desert sand as if they were propaganda pamphlets. Another thing a keen-eyed observer may have been able to see was a shape drop from the botton of the craft.~

<u>Kapak:</u>
With a heavy thud, a massive ball of flesh crashed down next to the X, sending a spray of sand up into the air as its mass displaced the powdered rock. The figure stood up, inhaling the fresh earthen air, a grim expression on its nightmarish face.
Kapak, the Plague Doctor. Kapak,  the Deceiver.
He had some words for the sender of the message. But first, he needed to find him.
Kapak stomped through the sand towards the edge of the river, gazing inwards across the bridges. He plucked the Mutalist Cernos from his back and nocked one of its fleshy arrows, pushing aside branches and leaves to get a better look.
Holding a bow in his hands brought back memories. Memories of Vuko.... and Kuve.... memories of when he and his two friends were galavanting through the system, a time before that accursed Orokin Remnant.
Vuko had taught Kapak how to shoot one day when they had stopped on Venus for a drink break. Kapak has just freshly grown the Infested bow specifically to try and bond with the Tenno Vuko, who had told him that during the old days, he had been an Ivara user.
But those memories were as good as gone. Vuko was dead. Kuve was dead. And Disruptis had cheated death somehow.</span>

The object tumbled a moment, then stabilized and made an upward arc before turning and rocketing toward the marked area, flying high above the ground, gleaming as it caught the sun.~

Isa:
With the roar of her Odonata prime&#39;s rockets, colored in a similarly gaudy mixture of blue and gold to her Saryn, Isa sped toward the destination indicated by Disruptis&#39; coordinates, curious as to what this was all about. An ally thought dead suddenly making a return had piqued her interest.

She spotted a familiar figure on the shore, a Nidus used by another ally of hers. It seemed she would not be the only one to hail this call. She dove downward now briefly before her Odonata&#39;s wings reversed themselves, slowing her to a hover in front of the Nidus, her Saryn gleaming in the sunlight along with the trim of her Galatine Prime, Rubico, and Lex Prime.</span>

The Nidus spun around to face the Archwing-bound Tenno, his arrow drawn back.
&quot;WHO TH-&quot;
He paused as his eyes were blinded by the sunshining Saryn. But it wasn&#39;t enough to conceal who it was.
&quot;Isa? Oh thank void, I thought it was some freakish bounty hunter who&#39;d set a trap.&quot;
He lowered the bow and breathed.
&quot;Now come on down, I&#39;m trying to scout out this place- there&#39;s a whole village here! We&#39;ll sort out pleasantries later, I just want to know where we are and who these people are! They&#39;re not part of the Ostron clades, they&#39;re too far away from the others.&quot;</span>

&quot;Absolutely.&quot;
Kapak couldn&#39;t lie, it was a little heartwarming to see and work with Isa once again. But also heartbreaking, as it brought up some sour memories.
There was a clicking noise as the comms connected.

⇝Helminth:
<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">-ISA TEKCHEN. A PLEASURE TO SERVE YOU ALONGSIDE MY MASTER ONCE AGAIN. IT HAS BEEN MANY UNITS OF TIME SINCE LAST OUR DESTINIES HAVE CROSSED. DOES YOUR VILE DEMON STILL SPEW HELLFIRE?</div>

&quot;Oh for Void&#39;s sakes, Helminth, she did not mean to burn that portion of the ship when we were patching her up on the Orbiter.&quot; Kapak would have rolled his eyes if he had any.  &quot;Sorry Isa, you know how he is. At least you don&#39;t have to look at his eyeball now.&quot;
He waved his fingers towards the village.
&quot;Alright then. I&#39;ll start to move towards the village, as close as I can get. You be careful in the skies- they don&#39;t look like the kind of people with advanced antiair technology, but be cautionary anyways.&quot;</span>

With a sigh and a shake of his head, Kapak turned around and continued to move towards the edge of the river.
“Well, at least she’s not using an Elytron. Otherwise I’d be worried she’d firebomb this whole area.” Kapak muttered to himself.
He crawled through the flora until he was standing almost right on top of the River.
He strained his vision in the gleaming sun to try and see what was on and around the bridges he had spotted earlier.</span>

The scattered islands lay in front of her, swallowed in a blanket of light pink. Heavily tanned villagers wrapped in thin cloths traveled about performing their various duties, of which Isa couldn’t quite make out. All their faces were obscured by what looked like… masks.~

~The sandy shores of the riverbank crunched beneath Kapak’s feet. Unfortunately, not a soul could be seen working this side of the river. Many bamboo constructs flanked the embankments, their contents deployed into the shimmering water below, obstructing them from view. Wooden pavilions mostly clear of overgrowth and packed with crates and strewn items dotted the landscape a little distance from the water. The bridge stretching a little off to the left was grounded into the riverbed via large pikes surrounded by massive stones, providing the structure with quite a load capacity.~</span>

&quot;It&#39;s.... clean.&quot; He said to himself, &quot;little to no microorganisms. No presence of Grineer biotoxins. What the Void kind of body of water is this flowing from?&quot; He stood up and eyed the underbelly of the bridge. Seems like it was sturdy enough to support a mutant Nidus climbing underneath of it.

&quot;And if they are armed and hostile, I doubt it would be well enough to take down my archwing before I can escape while letting loose a missile barrage.&quot;
She hovered in place, waiting for a response from Kapak as she continued to observe the villagers.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Hold on, my guest.” A hollow voice called out in sonorous tenor, disturbingly close behind the Nidus. 

~Amongst the dense vegetation just a couple steps out of his sight, a man leaned back against a tree. A sizeable mammalian skull engulfed his entire head, shining a beetle green in the small glimpses of penetrating sunlight. Antlers protruded from the top, decorated with leaves and a few vegetables. The stranger wore a thin, ornate tunic cut in the middle in order to expose his midriff to the pleasant breeze. A large farming scythe also rested against his right shoulder.~

~As Isa loitered in the air, popping noises could be heard from a variety of directions around her. The pink petals that strayed close enough to catch the flames of her burners seemed to be… engaging in miniature combustions.

Meanwhile, the villagers along the riverbank finally took notice of the airborne Tenno. At this distance, the masks on each of their faces were revealed to be skulls. They covered the entire head with some showing off small antlers and others, various beads and cloths hung from the back. 

Three of them stopped whatever they were doing with the bamboo constructs sunk into the flowing river and conversed with one another. Isa couldn’t hear them over the sound of the environment and her archwing. After a couple seconds, one ran off inland while the other two remained on the embankment and held a hand up to the Tenno.~</span>

She decided to try one last effort to break through these people&#39;s thick skulls, she spoke one last thing to Kapak: &quot;Apyo, kay pke jutykop to sitp.&quot; She then raised her rifle into the air, she fired off a shot into the sky, the sniper rifle&#39;s report echoing throughout the area. She spoke as she leveled her weapon back into a resting position, taking her finger away from the trigger. &quot;Stop groveling and answer me.

The man guiding Kapak froze, his head snapping to the source of the gunshot. He couldn’t see well over that much river, but the concern within him could not be disregarded. The man’s skull hid his worried expression.

“Um… yes,” he blinked, shaking himself to wariness, “anyway, as I was saying, we have prepared accomodations for your presence inside Kawamo.”

They arrived at one of the nearest pavilions. Crates lined the edges of the marble floor. Nets and various fishing equipment were strewn over the rail guards surrounding the entire structure. The man stopped in the middle of the circular floor and pointed upwards to a spot not visible from Kapak’s position.

“Do you mind retrieving that for me?”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Isa</span>
“They cannot bring themselves to face an angel, Tenno,” a voice called out from a few meters to the left bank of Isa. A women donning a beautiful matte, dark blue skull strolled up to the Saryn. Beads hanging down from along her small, white antlers clacked softly in the wind.

“Especially when your figure shines like one,” she added, offering a small bow. The villagers still trembled slightly at the sound of the gunshot.</span>

At the man&#39;s request, Kapak looked upwards and failed to see what the man was asking for.
&quot;Er, alright I guess,&quot; Kapak answered the man as he crouched downwards. With one fluid motion, he channeled Void energy through his twisted, fleshy legs, compressing  the air beneath him in order to propel himself upwards. A bullet jump maneuver, hopefully not too powerful as to knock the man down.
Upon landing, Kapak looked around to see what was there.
&quot;What is it exactly here you need?&quot;</span>

Folded and laying on the little storage cubby lining the inside of the pavillion’s roof was a dark blue tunic. The tunic looked massive, enough to cover even the modified Nidus from head to toe, even including a hood for his head. 

What was on top of the cloth would easily catch more attention. It was a large, white oval that curved inwards slightly and featured a strong band of some kind connecting either side at the back. A pair of grossly oversized gloves made from coarse fibers also sat beside the getup.</span>

A passing thought swept through his mind about how much damage the village seemed to suffer in the presence of Tenno. Not that they had much choice. 

He held out his arms towards the Tenno, trying to calm him down.

“Peace, peace! The villagers will grow very frightened by your appearance. They may start abandoning their posts to run for the other side of the river. We do not mean to distress,” he frantically explained.

The green skull was still dodging the real issue, of course. They didn’t want the people of the skull to lose trust in the Tsukait by bringing a warframe into the village. But, it’s not like they wanted any Tenno to realize that. Especially when they can often do… things just for the sake of defying others.</span>

&quot;Is this because I look like a walking corpse?&quot; Kapak asked. He was no stranger to the idea that he was one ugly fathermucker, but he was still suspicious.
Kapak allayed it though, and threw the cloak over himself. It did slightly impress Kapak that they managed to create something that could conceal his massive body.
&quot;There. I&#39;m not putting on those ridiculous gloves, or that white plate of a mask. Let&#39;s just go.&quot;
He was getting impatient. He just wanted to see if Disruptis was truly there.</span>

“Injured?” The blue skull repeated curiously, leaning forward and tilting her head. She froze for a couple moments in thought. 

“Ah yes, I see. You must be the one he told us about, right? Disruptis wishes you to meet him with your messenger, but if you absolutely cannot, then take to the skies once again to the other side of the river. On the right-most bridge there will be a man in a green skull waiting for you. He will make proper accommodations for you.”</span>

The green skull started towards the Nidus, then wavered. His hidden mouth quivered as another retort threatened to escape, but was eventually swallowed. He didn’t wish to push his luck.

“Very well,” the man declared, retrieving his staff off the nearby pillar and pounding the butt end once on the ground, “I shall lead you forwards. Keep your hood up.”

And with that, he lead the way back to the bridge.</span>

The blue skull paused. She hadn’t expected that. Disruptis had told them that messengers need not fear wounds, for any amount of gravity of injury simply heals quickly. What was this Tenno talking about? Perhaps she was merely trying to spite them. 

Disruptis had warned them about that too.

Fortunately, the Tsukaits technically did have a solution for this problem, even if it was indeed accidental coincidence. The Tenno had mentioned the true recipient of their costume had already met what sounded like Ivarill, so that meant Boonka was still waiting. It just so happened that the villagers had prepared more than one costume for the ‘one without a messenger’ and placed them at either ends of the river in case he had taken an alternate path. She have to wear the backup instead. While the blue skull decided the garment would be quite long on this Tenno, it was a good enough alternative.

But if another came without a messenger, there would be trouble.

“Oh,” the lady spoke up again, “My mistake, it’s true that your friend has met him. Your accommodation is to the left from here instead, on the other side of the river. Look for one of our white structures there and you will find a man with a purple skull. Please seek him, if you will.”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Kapak</span>
~Kapak followed the shiny green skull through the path and onto the bridge. The structure proved quite impressive, not budging an inch to his massive strides… in most places. The breeze felt pleasantly cool amidst the late afternoon sun. Sounds of the bubbling river caressed their ears. As they drew closer to the opposite shore, a flurry of pink petals quickly made their home on the Nidus’s cloak.~

“Ah yes,” the green skulled man spoke up after a period of silence, “you wished to learn about Kawamo? By your reaction, I assume your brother hasn’t informed you of our clan.”</span>

We hold stories from our ancestors, passed down to us. They enlighten us with a foggy view of our origins.”

The man held his scythe sideways as they walked. The blunt end of the sickle dragged lightly across the top of the handrail.

“We live as quietly as we can, barely interacting with the outside world. The grineer leave us alone: partially because of the treacherous sands and skies, partially because our lands hold no value to them. It’s not worth the risk enough for them… yet.”

The long bridge finally ended. Kapak’s feet met soft soil as they continued towards a stone path.

“We were largely blinded from the system’s squabbles here. That is, until you Tenno came. Your brother has been the largest supporter of Kawamo. He somehow solved our river’s slowly growing toxicity problem.”</span>

Kapak shrugged.
&quot;Bizarre that no outsiders have bothered you. Ever run into Ostrons? They&#39;re a northeast of here.&quot; Kapak gazed upon the desert lands beyond the oasis.

Boonka was sitting on the storage pavillion’s bench when fire descended upon him.

With a start, he scrambled up to a standing position as Isa detached from her archwing and hit the ground. The gentleman was as sharply-dressed as a villager could seem to get: with sleek, wellfitting black attire made of the same garments the others wore. His violet skull and antlers held immaculate symmetry in positioning. Everything about him seemed refined, even his surprised stance.

Except his name, of course.

The purple skull quickly made an effort to adjust his collar.</span>

The green skull hesitated. “We have... journeyers who meet with the Ostron and bring back tales of the splendor of Cetus. It is… difficult… for them to venture out, however. We do not wish to expose ourselves to the outside as much as possible, so picking up the tabikaiken is no small task.”

The two continued farther on the stone path. Villagers worked on various tasks around them. Some were busy planting crops, some were lugging fishing equipment around, some were idly chatting outside storehouses. Every single one of them wore a skull, save a couple of playful children that dashed across the path ahead who had on something closer to a mask.

Most took notice of the disguised Nidus, but none seemed suspicious of anything. One open-area pavillion complex the walked by held out-dated cloth-weaving technology, but the mechanisms were covered with bark, bamboo, and string wherever it seemed possible. 

“And as for your brother? My. He’s accomplished much goodness for our clan, but much crazy too. Keeps us quite safe. It’s a bittersweet thought: receiving the best of allies for the transition into the public world, but slowly losing the anonymity we once claimed. We knew we needed to deal with this in our time but…” he gave a tired sigh, “many hoped it otherwise.”

He paused for a second amidst a relatively secluded stretch of the path, hidden by dense bamboo trees on either side.

“But enough about sorrow, we are very glad to have another brother of Disruptis here, Tenno.”</span>

“Wow...” Kapak breathed as he observed the stalky trunks of the bamboo. “These plants still grow out in the wild? This place... this place is incredible!” Kapak reaches out and caressed the yellow-green wood.
“Before now, I thought the only place left in the system where these grow were in Tenno gardens, in dojos.”
Kapak shook his head.
“Remarkable! New Loka would flip if they found out about this place! This makes their Silver Grove look like a joke!”
He cleared his throat and turned to face the man.
“Would you mind if I took a sample? Then we can continue on our way,” Kapak inquired, shuffling his foot.</span>

 The purple skull opened his mouth in response, but uttered nothing. Perhaps Disruptis had made some… miscalculations on this size of his guests. He let his mouth hand for a couple more seconds then shrugged and gave a light bow.

“Of course, it’s a pleasure to have your presence in our village. I hope you were able to find us without any problems?” the man asked. He lunged two steps into the pavillion as he listened for a reply, drawing near a thoroughly pressed blue garment that lay sprawled flat across a large crate. The purple skull picked it up daintily.


<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Kapak</span>
“U-um. I suppose so,” the green skull stammered in reply. The man wasn’t certain whether that was a good idea or not, but figured they were giving up their privacy anyway. 

<em>Caw!</em>

The strident sound reached Kapak as he turned back around. Behind the green skull, and a few meters up, there was a crow hanging onto a bamboo stalk like a woodpecker to a tree, with its claws imbedded into the plant.

<em>Caw! Caw!</em>

It sounded once again, this time even more metallic and distorted than before. Upon closer inspection the Nidus could notice that it is not a living, breathing creature, but instead a mechanical construct.

The bird seemed to be observing him. It’s eyes like obsidian marbles, eager to plunge under the cover of the hood, eager to know more about the stranger in the cloak.</span>

He turned to the skull masked man and pointed at the empty branch.
&quot;What was that? It was a proxy, that&#39;s for sure. Surveillance?&quot; Kapak stepped forward, his heel dragging some weird fleshy tubercle out from the ground as he took a step.

“I am not sure… it is not ours,” the green skull replied with a hint of suspicion. After a few moments of staring into the distance, the villager readjusted his grip on his scythe and pounded the ground once with it. “Come, let us head to Disruptis quickly.”

Almost abruptly, the bamboo fell away to another shore. A much shorter bridge spanned the distance between this one and the next island over. The two crossed it in no time at all. 

“Hai, Dokutaa!” Kapak’s guide called out to a woman wearing a dark blue skull a little aways from the path they tread. She was gazing intently towards the water’s edge.

“Ah,” the lady responded, peeling her eyes away for a brief moment, “Ivarill, aisatsu!”

The exchange didn’t break their pace. The Nidus could easily notice the increased population density on this bigger island. Their walk took them past many structures with albeit a little outdated technology, but what really caught the eye was their placement and external design choices.

Kapak watched as a thick polymer curtain was pulled over a data-screen mounted to the wall, cleverly disguising it as a window. Children playing in the fields accidentally knocked over a wooden barrel, only to reveal a standard ferrite container nestled inside. All while the breeze continued to rain sheets of pink petals everywhere.

The finally, the green skull stopped in front of a large building featuring many traditional Tenno archways. It&#39;s red, wooden beams greatly contrasted with the surrounding environment.

“We have arrived. Take the outside hall to the left until you reach the second right. You’ll no doubt find him in one of the rooms.”</span>

“Not to worry, we’ve planned all this ahead of time,” the purple skull answered with a dismissal wave of the hand. “Dokutaa sent you though? Shimatta…”

The dandy man gave a couple raps to the pavillion banister in quick succession. <em>A shame, I was hoping to enjoy our tea time. That woman wins at everything.</em>

“Enough with that. If you would kindly follow me, we will depart,” the purple skull said, moving onto the path ahead and extending his arm towards further down it. “I will answer any questions you might have while we progress.”</span>

The Nidus wasted no time. With two massive strides, he crossed over the ground and stepped onto the porch, and with another two he moved through the sliding door- opening it and passing through in one swift motion. With that, he was inside.
Kapak boldly stepped through the halls, paying no heed to any decorations or hung art, nor did his gaze loiter on any others who he found within. He knew what- or rather, who, he was looking for.
Finally, he reached the door that had been described to him. He stopped in front of it and gripped its frame. He paused for a moment, everything becoming silent (besides the low creaking and cracking of door frame as Kapak&#39;s nervous grip crushed the wood). This was it, the moment of truth. If Disruptis was truly alive here, could there be more who also survived all those months ago?
Kapak flung the door sideways and barged into the room, his massive frame barely fitting through the door&#39;s.</span>

Kapak almost seemed to slide across the very floor at the speed that he reached. In the blink of an eye the towering mutant of a Warframe was directly in front of the Tenno, right arm outstretched. It lunged forward as if it were a Corpus Orb proxy, with the intent of closing around the Tenno&#39;s throat.

The smile on his face didn’t budge an inch.

“Ack-- hey-- ck-- Kap-ah…” he managed to squeeze out of his throat. Now close-up, the Nidus caught a good look at a large, new scar starting from the operator’s right cheek and disappearing down his neck. The blemish seemed to only accent his incredulous grin.</span>

Disruptis slid across the floor, scattering and tearing bits of paper before slamming his back into the tipped table. He grunted in pain with a face fixed in delirious laughter. Three chuckles escaped his lips.

“I--” he began, looking down at his arms. He imagined the long, white scars now lacing his body just underneath the seams. He imagined what made them. He imagined the time he’d missed.

Then, slamming his palms into his closed eye sockets, the Tenno drilled all his fingers into his face. His open smile twisted into gnashing of teeth.

“N-no,” his voice came again, shaky and broken. “H-how many in the end?”

<span class="pre pre--inline">--((Isa</span>
Boonka led Isa through the various sights of the Kawamo as they approached their destination. The buildings were mostly dedicated to manufacturing in the upper districts, so there was no shortage of various smith stations and ship factories. All of the newer technology was covered by dried grass, wood, and all sorts of natural items. Isa even walked by a miniature generator covered in flowers and vines. Thankfully, the walk had been uneventful.

Until someone called the out from behind.

“Boooo~nka!” yelled an energetic young girl approaching the two. She wore a white skull faintly brushed by a hint of pink. The mask included small, faded purple ram horns protruding out from the back in a circle.

“Ah, Sangata, I’ll--” the purple skull began to say before the girl sauntered over to the disguised Isa and cut him off.

“Who are you???” she blurted eagerly, addressing the Tenno.</span>

Kapak paused for a moment, regarding Disruptis&#39; mannerisms. The inquisitive Tenno had always seemed to have a screw loose, but now it seemed like something was actually up. He was definitely off.
&quot;Three... well, four now that you&#39;re alive again,&quot; Kapak grunted. He paced around the room, keeping his head turned towards the yellow suited Operator.
&quot;Isa, Cev, and myself. Everyone else... everyone else is dead.&quot; Kapak paused to pick up a piece of paper off the top of the desk as he paced by it, glancing at it out of curiosity.
He kept majority of his focus on Disruptis though.
&quot;That scar,&quot; Kapak said, pointing at the imperfection marring the Tenno, &quot;looks nasty. The Void happened? And you better explain everything. I want a damn good reason why you just-&quot; Kapak snapped his fingers- &quot;disappeared when we needed everyone the most.&quot;
Kapak&#39;s voice... quivered? It was uncharacteristic of the Nidus&#39; usual tough-guy act. His face didn&#39;t show any emotions though; it remained with a grimace plastered on his angry, crimson, bloated cherry of a head atop his shoulders.</span>

Isa&#39;s gaze wandered about the village as she was guided through the village. It seemed these people were slightly less primitive than they initially seemed, as she now spotted the well-hidden technology they used. Still, their worship of the Tenno was something that annoyed her. Her thoughts were disrupted  by the sudden arrival of a small girl addressing Boonka, and next her. She didn&#39;t hesitate to answer the girl.
&quot;My name is Iya.&quot;
She responded, her voice distorted as usual from the combination of speaking through her warframe and her voice being synthesized through her artificial larynx.
&quot;I am here to do some business with Boonka.&quot;</span>

Disruptis shifted his hands over his mouth, freeing the already red-stained eyes underneath. All of his repressed emotions came out at once as he failed to choke back a couple of tears.

“O-oh.. Void…” he muttered through a pained expression. The lump in his throat still swelled amidst the bitter sadness, desperately trying to contain a waterfall of sorrow. The Tenno didn’t even bother trying to answer Kapak’s other questions just yet, allowing himself a silent moment to breathe his grief.

~The paper Kapak had picked up seemed to be the layout of some sort of grineer structure. Various notes in Disruptis’s terrible handwriting were scrawled over various entrances, ramps, and what looked like devices. At a glance, the Nidus could pick out the biggest words on the page contained in a much more attractive circle: “Don’t touch the migraine modulators! You will be breakfast!”~</span>

“I already heard from Cev how it happened,” he finally spoke up in a somber and sullen tone, “I knew I should’ve had him break the news before this.”

The yellow Tenno hugged his knees tightly to his chest.</span>

The tribal gentleman paused to steal a glance at the robed warframe, his mind racing. “...here to see about supplying us some new generators. Now, you should head back to the task I know you left.” He finished with a shaming finger.

“I was on breaaak~~” the young girl complained. Of course, that was a white lie. Knowing her uncle would be able to see through it, she retreated off down the street.</span>

“No, I only got in touch with Cev yesterday. He couldn’t get a hold of you any faster than I could. But before I go explaining what’s been happening I think we should wait for others...” the sentence trailed off before Disruptis looked up at Kapak with a more hopeful expression.

&quot;Oh, Cev only showed up yesterday... uh.... well, I&#39;m still mad at you! I am furious! The only reason I&#39;m not slamming your yellow-suited body against the wall is because I want to know about whatever the Void&#39;s going on!&quot;
Kapak slumped onto the floor across from Disruptis, his massive body comically bumping things gently as he sat, and his weird cloak snagging on the desk&#39;s edges.
The Nidus emitted a sigh.
&quot;Yeah... Isa&#39;s coming. We split up to scope out this place,&quot; Kapak said as he yanked on his cape, trying to dislodge it from its entrapment, &quot;you must understand from my... past that there are a lot of people willing to go great lengths for my capture. It&#39;s been such a long time that Black Obsidian wants to raise my bounty by another 10k platinum. <em>Ityate suykety</em>.&quot;
With a final tug, the cape came free of the desk&#39;s corner.
&quot;You mentioned Cev told you things... did he tell you about...&quot; Kapak inhaled and spoke again, voice still shaky, &quot;...about what happened at the Grineer Fortress?&quot;</span>

Having been guided to the room by Boonka. Isa stepped inside now. Her Saryn still wearing the cloak and mask. Now out of sight from the villagers, she revealed her true self, appearing in front of the Nidus and other Tenno. Or at least it was likely her. She wore the same outfit, though with the hood up, concealing her face.

&quot;Ah, so the deserter has decided to reveal himself.&quot;

Her synthetic voice rings out, dripping with venom.

&quot;I see you&#39;ve made a nice little cult.&quot;

Something about the way she held her body seemed off. It was oddly tense, though not as though she was ready to attack. She seemed to instinctively be leaning somewhat to the right.</span>

Disruptis furrowed his brows in suspicion. “Cev shou--” 

The door slid open. Disruptis quickly wiped his wet face as best he could and twirled around just as the beautiful golden Saryn entered. Before the Tenno knew it, Isa was standing in front of him, in the flesh. Disruptis immediately perked up and shoved his melancholy tone further down his throat.

“Eyyyyy Isa!” He called out, leaning onto the overturned table with a beaming grin, “Just in time--”

<span class="pre pre--inline">&quot;I see you&#39;ve made a nice little cult.&quot;</span>

“Huh?” Disruptis blinked, “Oh. Ha! I know what you’re talking about. As much as I’d like to take credit, that was something the elders themselves cooked up and served to their people.”

He swung himself around the table and meandered up to one of his old partners. His arm stretched out to offer a firm handshake. 

“Good to see you again,” Disruptis spoke genuinely.</span>

She looked at Disruptis&#39;s hand for a moment, then her gaze moved back up to his face. Even behind the mask, one could sense the maliciousness of her gaze. The tension in her stance grew. It seemed now to be not just discomfort, but hostility. Flames began to sprout from her left arm, spreading over her body. The Void fire that she had been known to have a talent with seemed to burn even hotter than when she had previously ignited Kapak.

&quot;Not that I care particularly about that. You&#39;ve done <em>far worse</em>.&quot; Her voice dripped with venom as she spoke. It was rather clear that unless he was able to talk quickly or subdue her, there would be a fireball flying at his face in a few moments.</span>

The Nidus shifted uncomfortably and took a multitude of tiny steps back until he was practically against the far wall. The mutant Warframe’s sudden shift from bitterness has quickly given way to an unconcealed, overwhelming fear of the embers coiling through the fingers of the Corpusborn Tenno.
“Ummmm.... ummmm...” Kapak seemed like he was trying to say something but all that came out were groans and squeaky whimpers.”</span>

<em>No. No, no. No no no no nonononono…</em>

“I-Isa? Ho-hold on. Before you make any judgements, please listen to what I have to say. I know I seem like scum prime right now but I promise..” he pleaded in a fearful tone.

The Tenno dropped to his knees knit his fingers together, holding them out towards Isa in a begging position.

&quot;Fine... explain yourself.&quot;

She said, then reached down and took hold of him by the shirt with her fiery arm, the flames licking at it, singing it and him, probably. She would lift him up to his feet and shove him back a step or two.

&quot;And do it without groveling like a tipyk.&quot;</span>

“Oh… yeah,” Disruptis replied, doing a complete 180 from his pleading disposition and returning to his normal self. He quickly stroked a couple fingers across his cheeks to dissipate heat from the singed hairs, but mostly shrugged the damage off.

“So, I might as well start the full explanation now as I…” Disruptis stole a glance and the cowering Nidus, “...don’t think we’ll have anyone else.”

He sat down against the overturned table once again and clapped his hands together. “Now, a quick recap. As you guys know, we disable the solar rails and move the tower into earth’s orbit. Then Vay Hek comes out of nowhere with a fomorian and tears us a new one. But just as it shows up, I disconnect from my warframe.”

Disruptis lifted his hands in wide gestures to symbolize each component in an invisible diagram. “I… could’ve never imagined the fomorian would show up. I did, however, rig some general countermeasures in case we needed to protect the tower from… unexpected threats. Had them on Sanctuary too actually. Only problem is I need to flip the switch in person back on my orbiter.”

His hands fell down on his lap. “Honestly, I’m not sure what I was thinking. It was the only thing I knew how to do. I hoped it would do… something. Anything really. Might’ve kept the void anchor from going boom long enough to get everyone out, but it’s hard to tell for sure….”</span>

She formed  more of a claw with her left hand as the flames began to concentrate there.

“I was about to,” Disruptis replied, meeting where he thought Isa’s concealed eyes might be. Now that he thought about it, it was strange for her to be wearing the hood up anywhere outside of a lab environment. 

“Message you, that is. But someone was waiting for me on board. They jammed my transmissions right as I entered and near-fried my cephalon. If it hadn’t been for her special properties, XerAI would’ve been toast.”

The Tenno got up and started pacing a safe distance away from the fiery Isa. “I’m not even sure what hit me. It was dark and all happened too fast. I fought a creature with the power to destroy oro and the intellect to slice me open for it. My best theory to this day is that it was a more… sentient, sentient. I have no idea how it pulled a wool over XerAI’s receptors and got in, but it did.”

He sent another glance Kapak’s way and pointed to the new scarring on his face. “That’s how I got this by the way. Mucker just about tore me up before I flushed it into Venus’s stratosphere. It couldn’t fly I guess. It was a long time before I finally healed. Like, this long.”</span>

The flames stopped converging in Isa&#39;s hand now. Still, they flickered and danced across her arms and body. &quot;I see.&quot;
The suspicion in her voice was still quite audible.

&quot;So this sentient attacked you, you managed to dump it, then came... here? Did you not have the means to message before you were healed?&quot;

Still, there was a hint of something more in her voice. Hearing about some new, and previously unknown form of sentient piqued her interest. If Disruptis was just making something up to not be burned alive, he knew what strings to pull with Isa.</span>

The Nidus visibly relaxed, no longer pressing his entire body as deep into the wal as possible. Yet, the still-flickering flames over Isa were enough to keep him from walking towards them.
“A Sentient. Really.” Kapak’s voice called out incredulously.
“What, a Conculyst waltzed into you Orbiter and unplugged your Somatic Link or something? Come on, at least make your tale believable.”
Kapak harrumphed. “There’s no Sentients left in the System that you couldn’t possibly deal with by yourself, unless it was Hunhow himself who flipped the switch on you.”
Kapak raised his hand to cut off any explanation Disruptis would try to give.
“Just... continue with the story. Let’s see where this goes.”</span>

“That’s… right Kapak. The whole battle was kind of weird actually…” Disruptis let his sentence trail off into the air as he stood with a ponderous expression.

“But regardless, as I said Isa, the sentient toasted my cephalon’s… um… memory… kind of. She lost everything in her databanks short of her own personality and a few important details. That meant she lost your calling cards, and couldn’t safely contact you with another general broadcast without letting the enemies know right where we were.”

Disruptis scoffed. “Well, I’m sure <em>I</em> could’ve rigged something up if I wasn’t out like an LED for the following months. Didn’t really come to until about a month ago.”

“Oh wait,” he interrupted himself, only now properly processing his companion&#39;s words. “Oh no Isa sorry, I didn’t come here for healing. XerAI wouldn’t take that risk. I had a nice little hidden station outside of systemic orbit that I chilled in.”</span>

Now, feeling much better that the heat that had radiated from Isa had diminished by a significant amount, Kapak took another step forward, closer to the conversation.
&quot;Yeah, okay... assuming this..... <em>&quot;SENTIENT&quot;</em> is real, it is reasonable. But there are millions of other better-known safe spaces we could&#39;ve met at.

A smile crept back on to Disruptis’s face. His eyes begun to shine with his old glee, as if the Tenno had picked out the perfect present for his best friend and couldn’t wait to see their reaction.

“Oh, are we gonna get to the fun stuff now?” He returned to the overturned table. “You see, I have a <em>lot</em> to explain, and a <em>lot</em> to do. So I’m going to get both things done at once.”

Disruptis heaved the table back into its upright position and the readjusted the now slightly torn map.

“Welcome, to Kawamo,” he continued, waving his arms over the giant sheet of paper. It showed a picture of the river and surrounding area. “Home to less than five thousand authentic members of a unique people group. They’ve stayed largely under the radar for years, even dodging grineer attacks thanks to the deserts all around. As far as I know, I and two other unrelated people are the only Tenno to ever stumble across it.”

“Now unfortunately,” Disruptis pointed to a couple small drill symbols a good distance away from the river, “The grineer do enjoy mining the desert for resources, so they’ve squatted in the more safer zones. They’ve tried a lot of times to cross over, but by the time they make it their ranks are so thin they can dodge rain drops! Easy pickings! That’s how it used to be, at least. Word now is that they’re getting more and more successful; It might only be a matter of time before the Kawamo have to up their response-game. But, we’re not worried about that today.”

Disruptis spread his arms across the table and leaned down on his hands. “I told these guys I’d help them out in little ways. Just kind of the thing I do when I visit new colonies, really. They hit me up not long ago to help them deal with a situation with some of their kin being kidnapped by the grineer. That’s the first part of why I brought us here, because I wanted to see if you guys were willing to help me with that. Any questions so far?”</span>

Disruptis allowed himself a deep, internal sigh. <em>Yeah…</em>

“Yeah yeah, I know you guys don’t care about this kind of stuff, so I wouldn’t have called you here if it was just that. The second reason is because I don’t believe for a VOID DAMN second that a hunting group of these people were so easily plucked up and rolled away by just the grineer, even with their supposed ‘recent success’. Not near the river, at least.”

Disruptis performed a cursory sweep of the large traditional room and the halls outside as he spoke. Satisfied with whatever he found, he returned to the two and continued, this time in his fairly good Corpus.

“[Corpus] I have reason to believe there’s someone helping them. Someone powerful, and who’s trying to lure me out into the open. Naturally as I am still recovering, so I can’t let that happen. I’m safe here, but I don’t know if the moment I step outside I’m going to be turned into fertilizer for the desert plants.”

He turned and lost his sight in the beautiful view outside of the window. “I’m not sure exactly which enemy of mine it is, but I know that if we can investigate the interaction between them and the grineer, we may be able to trace them back. They may have some very good piece of tech that they’re using to stay alive in the desert, and that’s well worth our time. It might even be orokin, who knows? [/Corpus]”</span>

&quot;[Corpus] Disruptis... I... had no idea your brain was that smooth. You speak like desert survival requires some sort of powerful technology. Given two hours and a Corpus shopping catalogue I could acquire all the products I need to survive in a desert for a year, indefinitely if I were to find an underground source of water. Honestly anyone smarter than a Grineer butcher with a small amount of the proper modern technology can survive the desert with ease. If you honestly believe that the Grineer are incapable of crossing the desert to attack these villagers if they thought them worth the manpower and fuel, you&#39;re only fooling yourself.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen anything other than some ancient plants, but I did see a robot bird,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;but it was unlike any design I&#39;d ever seen. It wasn&#39;t a Corpus proxy, and it definitely wasn&#39;t crude enough to be Grineer.&quot;

Disruptis blinked at both of their responses. “Well muck, the odds of that happening were supposed to be very slim. I…” he gave a dry, incredulous laugh. “Well that’s gonna make this a little harder to explain. Just my luck too. Where to begin?”

Disruptis fully entrusted his weight to the table, taking the time to gaze into the air for a couple seconds. “So, first of all, Kapak. Don’t worry about what you saw. I’ll talk about that in a bit, but just know that isn’t from around here. Well, that is, if I do in fact know what you are referring to. Second, Isa. Actually truth be told, Kawamo isn’t exactly safe enough for comfort. The whole area sits inside an overlap of two flying beasts’ territories. On one hand you have the akuul, a type of...oh what’s the word...” he snapped his fingers repeatedly as shuffled through his memory, “chiroptera. Giant ones, powerful too. They hunt in small packs using echolocation to sweep the air for munchies. On the other hand, you’ve got the feezabii. Hardy avians who are even bigger and stronger than the akuul. They don’t usually hunt together, but if something attacks even one then you can bet your left somatic circuits that they’re all gonna swarm. Both these parties can go toe-to-toe with Tusk Bolkors. They both protect Kawamo from flying grineer, and keep it safe by gobbling up most large fish that wander down from the lake upriver.

Disruptis threw his arms open into a shrugging gesture. “Now, you’d <em>think</em> that they would wipe out the villagers too, but that’s strangely not the case. They both don’t touch animals on the grassy lands, and just about barely hunt land-bound creatures that aren’t the zillions of worms infesting the dunes. We only have a few theories as to why that is but it’s not something we’ve managed to figure out yet, so we can’t count on it being that way forever.”

As I said, there are millions of these worm-like creatures popping up and down from the surface. Some are big, some are small. They’re the main meat of most animals here, but still give a challenge to anyone travelling along the ground. Not to mention the <em>other</em> things that walk around on legs.”

He shivered. “But I’m getting off track. Point is: a lot of scary stuff roams around here. The grineer have tried their fair share of schemes in the past, but frankly, there’s just no real reason for them to send a gigantic assault. No natural resources, no access routes, no artifacts, no individuals who pose a threat. Just the many corpses of their lost ships.”

He ended the sentence with a couple taps on the tabletop. “Now, any other questions? I have some other stuff to show you that I guarantee you’re gonna like.”</span>

The Nidus pouted, grumpy as ever... but the mention of enormous creatures did interest him. If there&#39;s one thing that intrigued Kapak, it was harvesting genetic material from fascinating beasts.
&quot;Alright, just show us what&#39;s up,&quot; Kapak said, caving slightly due to his intrigue in this weird place. Something still seemed off, but all he could do was plow ahead.

Disruptis’s stare flattened on Isa. He had been around the corpus tenno for long enough to pick up on at least some of her tells, and it was clear she somehow wasn’t convinced. It wasn’t even his opinion, she just seemed to distrust his intel. A very peculiar bias, but he had grown rather used to it at this point. Isa wouldn’t be Isa without it. 

<em>Although, I wish she trusted me just a little,</em> Disruptis couldn’t help but admit.

“Wait Isa, are you alright?” he asked with a concerned frown, “you’ve been making some odd moves since you got here. What’s up?”</span>

&quot;Y’see, lady fortune wouldn’t let me be the only one to escape presumed death, that’d be kind of killing the hate-relationship we have. She had to balance the scales somehow.&quot;

The two sets of steps, while seeming out of tune, blend in wonderfully to announce the arrival of the last individuals Kapak and Isa would have expected to appear together: Vuko and Garhul

Dressed in a tunic simmilar to those of the natives, his skin a bit paler than usual that seem to add years to his youthful appearance, crow&#39;s feet under his eyes which deepen his light face, and his body appearing thinner than before from the slight loss of his muscle mass. He lifts his head to gaze at Kapak and Isa, a bright playful smile spreading across his face as he leans on the doorframe and crosses his arms over his chest.

<strong>Vuko</strong>

The kubrow appears a second after Vuko did, the towering beast slipping forth from the shadows to stand beside the leaning boy. Just like Vuko, the faithful kubrow is not as the same as before everything went to the shitter. His left ear is nowhere to be seen on his heavy head, as it was cut at the base months back, leaving a uneven gash on that side of his face that is now mostly covered up with his crimson coat. The fur around his left shoulder area is much thinner, which just barely covers the wrinkly scorched flesh beneath that stretches from his elbow all the way to the top of his shoulder. His bulkiness is less impressive than it once was but even without all of the muscles he still looks just as terrifying, if not familiar.

His dull golden eyes lit up as they land on Kapak and the large beast quickly springs towards the fleshy warframe, barking in all joyful tones as he basically throws himself at the Nidus for a powerful, yet loving, tackle.</span>

The Nidus was too stunned to register anything that came out of Disruptis&#39; mouth, or what came through that door. The next thing Kapak knew, he was lying on the floor with Kubrow slobber all over his face.
&quot;Whoa boy!&quot; Kapak began to giggle, something relatively uncharacteristic for the previously angry Nidus. But he could tell by the canine&#39;s scent immediately who it was. &quot;Garhul! Lemme up!&quot;
He pushed the excited Kubrow off of his chest and scratched at the behemoth&#39;s neck, the skeletal grin engraved onto the Warframe&#39;s skull growing into a beam.
He stood up and saw Vuko, and for the first time in a year, Kapak was... happy.
&quot;Vuko!&quot; Kapak laughed as he quickly closed the gap between him and the Tenno, but instead of choking him like he had to Disruptis, the Nidus wrapped his arms around the boy, lifting him into the air with his powerful embrace.
He set the Tenno down and rested a hand on his shoulder.
&quot;You&#39;re... alive! I thought... you were dead? I mean, all this time-&quot; he reached out and gave Garhul another ruffle. Kapak grabbed his thumb and tore it off, holding it high in the air for the Kubrow to reach for.
Kapak&#39;s smile faltered for a moment.
&quot;Devros... he... he didn&#39;t make it, did he?&quot;</span>

Isa barely moved as Garhul and Vuko entered the room. Her head turned to face them, but beyond that she stood with her arms crossed in the same position of discomfort as she had been.

&quot;Ah Vuko. It&#39;s good to see that you survived.&quot; She said, her voice lacking in emotion. She eyed Garhul for a moment, but didn&#39;t speak to the kubrow at all. Unfortunately it seemed his master was not as lucky as Disruptis or Vuko.</span>

Disruptis flashed Vuko a playful grin from the other side of the room and shrugged. “Hey, you know me man. What’s a few minutes late if the party never stops?”

The Tenno sat cross-legged on the table, watching the spectacle of the reunion unfold. He couldn’t help but break out in an beaming smile upon seeing Kapak greet the two, much like someone seeing their best friend receiving the perfect gift they picked out for them. The sight invigorated Disruptis. While their initial greeting had gone sour, at least he was able to gain some grain of delight in relishing the smiles of his fellow Tenno.

Well, minus Isa of course. But then again, Disruptis never could quite read that girl. Maybe she was happier than she let on, or maybe not.</span>

A small giggle escaped his mouth as Garhul pinned Kapak to the ground, one giant laying on top of the other. It was truly quite the sight, especially for Vuko who hasn’t seen Garhul this happy since... the accident.

He shifted his gaze towards the corpus-raised Tenno next. “And vice versa, Isa.” He knew he shouldn’t have expected much from her in the terms of a warm welcome, but he still hoped she would have shown the smallest bit of happiness. So it did sting a little bit seeing her as cold as ever.

Before he had a chance to answer Disruptis with yet another quippy line, Kapak had managed to free himself from the giant ball of fur and love and was now lifting Vuko in a bear hug. He groaned quietly while trying to speak out as the giant nearly crushed his torso. “...missed....you....too...” he managed to let out before being let go of. Once on the ground again he gasped for air while Kapak started bombarding him with questions.

“It’s a long story.” He managed to let out to respond to his friends questioning. As he mentioned Devros however, all the happiness fades from his face in almost an instant. He looks Kapak straight into where his eyes would be with an expression that can only mean one thing. He’s gone.

“How about I tell you everything later over a beer, eh?” His voices raspy, dry and filled with sorrow.</span>

The monster of a kubrow leans off the Nidus, his stubby little tail wagging as wild as it can, his tongue lolling down the side of his powerful maw that gives this goofy expression on to his furry face. There are few individuals that capture Garhul greatly, and while he was raised to be reserved and obedient, he couldn’t help but throw himself at the familiar friendly scent…the scent that mixed with <em>his</em> 

And so, joy…sticks to him…  

He let’s out a pleased gruff at the welcoming scratches, leaning in to the touch, his remaining ear pulling back to open up his face in to a bright display of <em>OH YEAH! RIGHT THERE!</em>

 The beast’s ear perks up as he hears a familiar snapping sound, urging him to lift his gaze upwards towards Kapak’s hands. Upon seeing a familiar sight, he let’s out another deep bark, licking his lips at the end. With a little butt wiggle, he stands up on his hind legs, stretching upwards in to his impressive height, his maw snatching at the prize and his front paws carefully pawing at Kapak’s front, holding for balance...thought...the leaning tower of Garhul might be a bit harder to hold for too long</span>

Kapak released the treat into the Kubrow&#39;s gaping maw before continuing to talk with Vuko. Voiddamn, he didn&#39;t know how little Devros could stand upright after enduring that much affection from such a beast.
Kapak gave a pat on the back to his old friend.
&quot;We have quite a bit to catch up on indeed,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;but not now.&quot;
He turned to Disruptis, quickly throwing a glance at Isa who was... characteristically impartial to everything happening. Nothing could stop Kapak from grinning like a goofball anyway. It was almost like having the Remnant back together again.
&quot;Okay... Bossman,&quot; Kapak said, bestowing his usual nickname for Mataeru on the yellow-suited Tenno before them, &quot;if you&#39;ve got any more suddenly alive friends, now&#39;s a good time to get them out. Otherwise, let&#39;s get on with this mission or whatever it is we&#39;re doing.&quot;</span>

Disruptis flinched.

“Ummm…” he murmured, nervously pulling on his collar. “Glad I have your support Kappa, but I don’t think I wanna pretend I’m filling boots as big as Mataeru’s. Just keep it normal.” 

Disruptis hopped off the table and attempted to fix up its map as best he could. “So, everyone gather round,” he continued, distributing some small wooden markers along the paper, “here’s what we know.”

The massive map showed a lot of scattered buildings with grineer symbols far to the west of the river. Disruptis drew an invisible line around them all. “Here are the closest grineer camps. They’re probably still holding the the captured as hostages. No way they’d let resources slip away, even if there’s next to no reason to do it. Our reconnaissance has been… hard. All we really know is that they change prisons a lot, bouncing from one camp to the next almost everyday. That means our fir-- er….”

The Tenno cut himself off just as he started getting carried away. Things couldn’t work that way this time. Void, he couldn’t even properly join them anyways. He looked up at everyone else with a sheepish expression, “Uh… er… Nevermind. Do you mind if you guys take on this mission without me? I’m not really fit to be a leader right now, and I’m still running tests on myself to see if I’m really alright up here.” Disruptis pointed a finger at his head. “Yes I know you guys have been making fun of my ‘smooth brain’ but what might be wrong will only hurt my fighting and strategy. It’s better if you guys make the plan for this one.”</span>

“That’s where I come in” Responded the Tenno, almost cutting into the end of Kapak’s story. Before continuing he gave a ‘nod of understanding’ to Disruptis. 

“You’ve been busy.” He said towards the Nidus with a little smile in the corner of his mouth. “You’re going to tell me all about that later. For now, I’ll be leading you into the compound.”</span>

“Eh, well muck, it looks like you won for once mate.” A voice chimed in from behind the group with a slight chuckle. An operator walked in with a pair of noticeable wired earpieces plugged into each ear. He was carrying a fire extinguisher in one hand as he approached. Cev span a platinum coin between the fingers of his free hand before throwing it over the heads of the gathered tenno over to Disruptis.</span>

The beast engulfs the finger but just as before, he shows no signs of chewing or swallowing…apparently preferring to keep the finger in his maw for whatever reason. The kubrow flips down on all fours once more, his tail wiggling…however it soon ceased at the familiar name being spoken. Devros.

His ear dips down slightly and the kubrow seems calmer than usual all of a sudden. He walks his way back towards Vuko, careful not to bump anyone or anything as he regains his original place beside the boy.</span>

Disruptis swiped the shiny coin out of the air and eyed it with a sneer. “Figures. The first time I win in three years, I only bet one coin.”

He pocketed the prize and returned his attention to the crowd. “Thanks Vuko. So as I said, the mission has two objectives. One, find out if the Grineer here are shaking some dirty hands, and two, rescue the villagers.” 

The Tenno quickly gave Isa a look. “Please,” he added.

“I’d sugges-- uh voiddammit-- You’re probably going to need to scout for intel first to find where the prisoners currently are. It’d probably be a good id...” Disruptis slapped both palms over each eye, “Ugh! Vuko what do you think you should do?”</span>

Without further ado, he was hunched over the table, studying the maps in search for any interesting clues that might give an advantage during the upcoming task.

When Cev comes in he doesn’t really bat an eye, as he’s absorbed with trying to memorise the entire surrounding terrain, with all plausible hiding, ambush, and otherwise suspicious spots. Only once Garhul comes back to him does he straighten up from the table and instinctively put his hand over the neck of the giant to pet him. 

“Well, as I see it we have two options.” He chimed in to respond to Disruptis’ query. “We either capture a reconnaissance squadron and try to force information out of them, but it’s not guaranteed they’ll even know anything. Alternatively we could try breaking into a facility and extract the prisoner travel schedule straight from their data vault. For this however, we would need to know where said vault is, which we don’t. Unless Dis has some more information he would like to share.” Vuko gives the black and yellow Tenno a look, as if a que to add some more details. “What do you think?” He asks as he turns around to face Cev, Kapak and Isa.</span>

Disruptis began to trace a circle around the three nearest hollow triangles, but quickly froze. He gingerly pulled his fingers back with a click of his tongue.</span>

His face takes on a wondering look as everyone starts voicing their opinions. “Hmmm...” He hums as a plan is formulating inside, his hand lightly stroking the chin.

“Let’s hope you’ve practiced your grineer, Kapak.” He said with a not so innocent smile sprawled across his face. “OK! So here’s how I think we should do this. We’re going to pass through the safe strait across the..” Vuko stops mid sentence as he bends over the table, trying to get a better look at what the map says. “Shitting? Oh wait no shifting! Across the shifting sands. From there we’re going to go for this one separate oil rig.” He points at the map towards the bottom right rig. “And we’re going all the way on foot to avoid any unnecessary attention. If we play this right they won’t even notice any Tenno were there. Them spotting us will bring unwanted attention to the village. In conclusion: no archwing or loud explosives.” Vuko deliberately gives Isa a stare after saying that, for obvious reasons.

“Once we’re next to the rig we’ll separate into two teams. Cev and I will first go inside in order to secure the highest ranking grineer in there, and subdue him non-lethally.” He said with emphasis on the last two words, making sure that it gets across. “On our signal Isa and Kapak will then storm the rest of the rig while we disable the alarm systems. If all goes properly, we will have access to both a hostage and the vault without raising any alarms.” Vuko stops for a quick re-breather, and gauge Disruptis’ response to the plan. “From there Isa and Cev will get to cracking the code, while Kapak and me have some fun with the commander.” He looks at his Nidus friend with a wicked expression on his face.</span>

He gave the Tenno an abnormally long middle finger (thanks to his mutated flesh) before falling serious once more to listen to the plan. Well, as serious as he could- a sputter escaped the Nidus&#39; jaws at the misreading of Disruptis&#39; map.
&quot;That sounds like a plan,&quot; Kapak said, once Vuko had finished. He gave a thumbs up, his hand morphing into various forms that some of the others may have recognized from Kapak&#39;s surgical procedures. He returned the mischievous grin to Vuko.</span>

“They’re um… uh… bigger rigs?” Disruptis replied before bursting into laughter at his own idiocy. He brought his breathing back under control and continued. “They’re kind of like supply and shelter bases mixed with a big fathermucking drill. Aren’t the only places villagers have been rotated, and they aren’t really favoured, but they have been used in the past. Also, the rectangles you see are dedicated storage warehouses. They aren’t in the rotation though.”

The yellow Tenno ran a hand through his ruffled black hair. At least that hadn’t left him. If there was one thing Disruptis couldn’t stand, it was being bald. “But yeah, sounds good Vuko. The grineer probably won’t give two mucks about saving a hostage, but he may have good info on how to find the captives, if you can crack him.”</span>

“I’m not hearing any objections, so... it’s settled!” He boomed at the end, whilst slamming both his hands on the table. “I’m assuming we should move out immediately?”  Vuko asked while turning his gaze to the yellow-clad Tenno, eager to get moving.

“Oh, and Kapak?” The Tenno interjected with a light-hearted tone on the side. “Do you know how to get in contact with Kuve? I still haven’t taken my blade back from her. You remember? The curved sword I inherited from my father?”</span>

The furry beast stood a few paces behind Vuko, his dull golden gaze jumping around the group as they shouted, talked, discussed between themselves, all the while slamming at this paper thing on the table. It’s a amusing thing to see…well…not as amusing at it is pleasant! This felt like old times, times full of laughter, warmth and so much cheer that it feels like it all happened in a different life. Nevertheless! Garhul feels calm in all of this, among all these people he’s met from a different era, their charisma clashing with one another. It is truly a moment of odd serenity. 

The enormous kubrow remained silent from his watch at the back, as he was trained to, occasionally clanking his teeth as he moves his lower jaw to readjust the treat in his mouth with his tongue, refusing to swallow it or even take a nibble! Some would think what he holds in his maw is some priceless treasure rather than a finger, with the way he cares for it in his mouth</span>

&quot;She&#39;s... late,&quot; Kapak said, &quot;very, very late, mind you. And, of course! How could I forget about that piece of craftsmanship? I always had found its design familiar in a bizarre way!&quot;
Kapak clicked his tongue and stuck both fists on his hips.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get a chance later to get your sword. We should move now! Dusk is upon us and we&#39;ll have the upper hand in the darkness.&quot;</span>

Disruptis nodded curtly in response to Vuko’s inquiry. A waft of warm desert air swept through the open window, blowing in the scent of some flowery fragrance. Outside, the sun sleepily closed its burning eye behind the sandy horizon.

Then as Isa explained Kuve’s fate, his eyebrow lifted up about half a mile. “Oh, is that what happened? That doesn’t sound like any kind of good,” he commented somberly.

<em>I should send people to look in on that…</em> The thought of the wild-spirited Tenno brought back bittersweet memories. Of tea parties, of battles, and of the crazy games they sometimes played. Disruptis remembered a time when Kuve marched right up to the sports supplies and pulled out some lunaro brackets and komi stones. Not willing to play either game, she invented her own using the items and a net. At first it was to see how many times people could toss it up to the air and catch it across the median, but it quickly devolved into everyone slinging stones at breakneck speeds to hit each other.

“May your soul rest well in the Void, dreamer. You’ve earned it,” Disruptis recited under his breath, too quiet for anybody to hear. The grief of losing her gently settled underneath his heart like a slowly sinking stone.</span>

He was almost in a jolly mood, despite Kapak saying that he doesn’t know where Kuve is at the moment, nor how to get his heirloom. The thought of going out there once again, with his friend by his side filled him with hope.

...that was until Isa opened her mouth. 
Hearing about Kuve’s death...

He froze. He just stood, rigidly still, as Isa’s words just floated into one ear, then went out the other. His face was chalk white, devoid of any sign of happiness that could’ve been seen before, a pale husk of the man that was there mere moments before.

Only after a long while, after Disruptis had paid his respects, and even moments after that, a single word of disbelief exited mouth. 

“...what.” Left his throat, his voice rasp, dry, and cracked.</span>

Nothing coherent could come out of the Nidus&#39; mouth. The Infested tendrils snaking from the crevices in his flesh drooped, the glowing boils growing on his muscles and through his bones shone ever dimmer.
Kapak bowed his head.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Vuko. I meant to tell you later... at a more appropriate time,&quot; Kapak managed finally, shooting Isa a dirty look (or as dirty as a face with nothing but a mouth can make), &quot;I wanted us to just... just to focus on this dumb mission...&quot;</span>

She looks to Disruptis now. &quot;After all, you do believe that these villagers may be being targeted in order to get to you, correct? If that is true, and they know they are dealing with a Tenno, then the Grineer may indeed be trying to lure a lone Tenno out into a trap in order to capture one to experiment on or simply to test this new weapon. It has been nearly a year since we first encountered them with working versions. They may have found a way to produce more of them, enough that they could be used out in the field.&quot; There was not one sign of sadness, or regret in her voice, no empathy for Vuko or the others. The grief she had over Kuve&#39;s death, if she even had any in the first place, had clearly already passed.</span>

Disruptis’s eyes widened in shock at the sudden realization of what had been said. He had always known that Vuko had a close relationship with Kuve, but it didn’t register until he witnessed the Tenno’s reaction. Disruptis never stopped to think about the implications of anyone else’s grief.

<em>Oh muck.</em>

“That is… uh,” he spoke up, “True…”

Disruptis leaned in close to the side of Isa’s concealed head and positioned a hand to cover the side of his mouth. “ᴮᵘᵗ ᶦᵗ&#39;ˢ ᵖʳᵒᵇᵃᵇˡʸ ⁿᵒᵗ ᵃ ᵍᵒᵒᵈ ᶦᵈᵉᵃ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉⁿᵗᶦᵒⁿ ᴷᵘᵛᵉ ᶦⁿ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ” he whispered.</span>

As his eyes glossed over from tears that he refused to let escape, it was like something... broke inside of him. Something deeply rooted, something so fundamental that Vuko hadn’t even imagined it could be gone. 

As little cyan embers begun to dance on his fingertips, and his eyes filled with unbridled rage, the Tenno leapt forward in anguish towards Isa, intent on closing his fingers around her small, breakable neck.</span>

Isa caught Vuko&#39;s movement out of the corner of her eye. She immediately raised her left hand and let out a beam of void energy aimed directly at Vuko, center of mass. She did not hold back at all with the destructive energy, and just like her void fire, it was more potent than most other Tenno. She would sustain it while stepping back away from Vuko until his advance stopped or he reached her, taking a few steps back as she did so. She maintained her usual calm demeanor despite the fact that she was firing a beam of destructive void energy at her ally. At least she wasn&#39;t using an amp.</span>

One does not need to understand the conversation happening to know that something, somewhere, went wrong. The atmosphere in the room dropped down to a tense chill and Garhul glanced towards his anchor, the friend he’s met on the island. Him and Vuko have spent months and months together so he’s learned to pick up on the emotions emitting from the war-blood kiddo. Vuko was hurting and Garhul could sense it. This anguish has manifested itself with a mixture of furry and heartbreak…a emotion that once consumed his greatest friend...but he helped Devros then and he will help Vuko now!

The kubrow didn’t think much of it, he is a protector from both physical and emotional pain, these things are in his nature, in his genes and in his guts! 

The lumbering beast makes a desperate jump towards Vuko in a attempt to tackle the boy to the floor with his paws before he could reach Isa, not minding that he’s practically leaping in front of a molten laser that would set his flesh ablaze.</span>

As Vuko silently thought, Disruptis moved back over to the map. He couldn’t read the expressionless mask his fellow Tenno wore, but he suspected it was bad. Disruptis immediately began drafting and experimenting a dozen ways to salvage the situation in his quick, Naramonic mind.

But then it all went to the Void.

Everything happened faster than Disruptis could work out a plan of action for. In the split seconds that Vuko lunged at Isa, the Tenno only managed to jump on the table and ready himself to intervene.</span>

He was about halfway towards Isa when the beam reached his chest, stopping him dead in his tracks. It wasn’t however enough to blast the Tenno back. He dug his heels in and tried to withstand the devastating stream of energy boring into his abdomen, his clothes lighting ablaze as a result.

But Vuko didn’t care. He was all but consumed with grief, and the attack on him sure as void wasn’t going to stop him. 

That is if Garhul hadn’t jumped in to protect him. The giant beast had no problems tackling him out of the way and down to the ground, taking a part of the damage directed at Vuko as a result.</span>

Lucky for Garhul, he didn’t stay in the laser’s path for more than a second as he tackled the boy and went down to the ground with him, the void beam traveling from his right shoulder down his side and ending at the upper rim of his rib cage. The fire not lingering long enough to burn his fur but it did scorch his flesh as it traveled, leaving the smell of burnet meat to linger in the air.

But, the beast didn’t notice the pain, nor did he care for it, as he flopped on top of Vuko with his chest, like a comfy and heavy blanket. He was hugging the boy on the floor, his forehead pressing against the others cheek in a protective manner…low whines call out to him in a plea, showing Vuko that he is here in his moment of ache. Garhul was calm, still, hoping his weight and affection would shine through and calm the raging storm within Vuko’s heart. On this, he would not budge, no matter how much Vuko would protest as he understand the boys pain…he too has lost someone precious.

When one person is missing the whole world seems empty.</span>

Isa stopped her beam as Garhul knocked the hostile Tenno over, doing her best to avoid scorching the kubrow. She found it somewhat ironic, the kubrow acting far more rational than Vuko at the moment. She walked around Garhul now, looking down at Vuko, her face hidden  behind whatever hood she wore. The fingers of her right hand twitched somewhat ominously.

&quot;How disappointing.&quot; She said before turning to Dispruptis. &quot;Perhaps someone more mentally stable should lead this mission.&quot;</span>

“Can all of you just chill for five mucking seconds?!?!??” Disruptis cried out in anguish, rushing over to the growing fire. He desperately patted the fire with open hands in an attempt to keep it down, but it only encouraged the flames to grow larger. <em>Hot hot hot!!!</em>

As Cev slew the flames, Kapak began to calm down. Eventually he made his way back to the main attraction and stood (although quite nervously) next to Isa, observing Vuko&#39;s rage from above.
&quot;Look Vuko, we all know how Isa is. She can be, frankly, a real arsehole. But she&#39;s far from evil.&quot;
He knelt down and stroked Garhul&#39;s fur as the Kubrow continued to keep Vuko subdued.
&quot;Those genetic freaks- the Grineer. They&#39;re the real target here. And if you can hold it together now, your patience will be rewarded.&quot;
Kapak stopped petting Garhul and laid one of his skeletal hands on Vuko&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Also if you calm down I won&#39;t have to inject you with some Voiddamn anesthesia.&quot;</span>

The kubrow didn’t move from his position atop Vuko, he continued to hug him on the floor, his muzzle burying between his own chest and the boys. He felt a hand on him, stroking him but he didn’t move at all, his entire focus is on protecting Vuko from his raging mind and shattered heart.</span>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
“Wai--” Disruptis defensively brought his arms in front of his face as Cev showered both him and the fire in cold carbon dioxide.

The flame was quenched, but the yellow Tenno sporting a new white coat.

“Ulgh,” Disruptis grunted in disgust, holding up his drenched sleeves. He cleared the fluid from his face with a deliberate swipe and crouched down. The wooden floor gained a glossy sheen as the hunched over Tenno wiped his suit against it.

“Look,” Disruptis announced, his voice languid and his gaze shifting in the quarreling Tenno’s direction. “Vuko, please stop. Kuve wouldn’t want this… and I’m sure you don’t actually want to take it out on us. Isa…”

He stood up and strode over to the two. Putting a hand on Isa’s shoulders, he gently but firmly pushed her away from the enraged Vuko and stared straight into the location he believed her eyes to rest. 

“..this isn’t some edgy postmodernistic movie scene. We’re all that’s left,” he continued in a subdued tone. Dismay creeped into his voice like the evening tide on the moonlit sands. “All of it. We need to look out for each other, because there’s not many left to support us.”</span>

Disruptis removed his hands from Isa and turned his face to everyone in the room. “I don’t know about you guys but… I always hoped that… the Remnant meant a little more than a banner to everyone. I… call me delusional but I saw us as great kin. I want to get us all together again and rebuild what could’ve been, because unlike Mataeru I value our bounds more than our objectives.” His confessions of hopes and dreams spilled out from his mouth as if pent up for a century.

He pounded a fist on the table. “And I’ll be MUCKED if anyone takes that away from me! Even Hunhow himself!”

His words lapsed into silence for a couple moments, his turned back obscuring any facial expressions that might be leaking across his face, hunched over where he punched the table. 

“If any of you have had enough of all of us... of all this... and want out,” the yellow Tenno’s voice cracked. “Please... leave now.”</span>

The Nidus crossed its arms as it stood up, looked across the room at the other parties.
The silence was deafening. At least, until Kapak finally broke it.
&quot;Look, I&#39;m not the sappy type usually,&quot; Kapak said, lifting a hand, &quot;but Disruptis is right. We were a family once. And that&#39;s quite a bit coming from someone like me who can&#39;t stay in the same place very long.&quot;
Kapak sighed as he leaned over, wrapping his hands around Garhul and attempting to lift the monstrous Kubrow off of Vuko.
&quot;Isa, why don&#39;t you get back to your ship and get some of your heaviest ordinance? We could probably use it.&quot;
Kapak turned his head to face Vuko, his eyeless, glistening skull reflecting the Tenno&#39;s visage.
&quot;Vuko... I... I&#39;m sorry. I wanted to break the news to you at a later point. I remember clear as day how tight you were with her. A Tenno I knew once told me the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb, and that was as clear as day with you two.&quot;
Kapak sighed.
&quot;I suppose if it made you feel better you could take some of your anger out on me, um, unless there&#39;s fire involved. But I have to a agree with Isa. Let&#39;s save it for those Voiddamn Grineer.&quot;
Assuming Kapak had been successful in moving Garhul, he extended an infested hand towards Vuko, offering to help him to his feet.</span>

He wasn’t happy. This whole situation triggered in him something that isn’t going to be quenched easily. However, Disruptis’s words managed to at least calm him down enough, so as he stopped his attempted assault on Isa.
The Tenno delicately pushed on the Kubrow, telling him to let go. 

Once Vuko’s free from the crushing weight, he stands up by himself, not accepting Kapak’s help. 
“Garhul, let’s go.” Without as much a comment on the speech, he attempts to leave the room, walking straight through whoever stood in his way. 

However, in a moment of hesitation, he pauses in the doorway for a moment. “I’ll see you at sundown.” He added, in a still clearly pissed, dried out voice, and then left.</span>

Even when the fleshy Nidus tugged him, the kubrow refused to leave. Only when he felt the gentle push from the boy bellow him did he move from atop him, feeling as if the wave that overtook Vuko finally lifted. The behemoth let out a huff through his nose, taking a glance at the people around before trotting after Vuko.</span>

&quot;Sick of this? No... news of this odd Sentient has finally piqued my interest. I just hope you can keep the more emotional ones under control.&quot;

&quot;What the muck&#39;s stealth?&quot; Kapak said with a grin as he stepped to the door.
The grin was as superficial as it got though- the Tenno had dreamt of reuniting with his old... friends... but...
He&#39;d imagined it to go over far more smoothly than what just happened. Vuko&#39;s bitterness seemed potent enough for the Nidus to taste.
&quot;I&#39;ll be back at sundown as well. We&#39;ve got a couple hours to prepare it looks like, and I&#39;m a bit hungry. I wouldn&#39;t want to kill this village off by eating all their supplies. Good to see you again, Disruptis.&quot;

Disruptis stood in place, unwavering. Then with languid motion, he straightened his back and folded his arms behind his back like Mataeru had so famously done. The Tenno hoped the action would inspire him with the same strength it seemed to bestow his former leader. With a flick of his fingers, the platinum coin flung itself from his grasp. Its fall to the floor sounded more like thuds than a clinks in the heavy atmosphere.

“Alright, leave me you two,” Disruptis ordered, his face still turned, “I’ll see you in a bit.”</span>

She cast off the primitive robe that was covering her warframe before attaching herself to the archwing and blasting off to be picked up by her landing craft at a higher altitude... her exit was far from a subtle one, but she&#39;d  be damned if she had to deal with walking through the village and encountering more of its curious children.</span>

Cev watched as Isa disappeared and turned towards the exit. “Well I guess I’ll see ya later mate.” He said and waved over his shoulder. Cev slipped through the exit and vanished into the village.</span>

The cool evening breeze ruffled Disruptis’s unzipped hood about in slow movements, like an ocean’s high tide. His gaze pierced into a beautiful horizon lit ablaze by the lowering sun. The wind churned whorls of pink petals into the room that threw themselves all over the floor.

<em>Heh.</em>

The sounds of chimes rung out in delightful chorus as each of the workers used them to send messages amongst each other. It was an old tradition.

<em>Ha.</em>

Cartfuls of harvest clambered up the roads in chains now with villagers boasting their work amongst themselves. They laughed and cried out in joyous companionship.

“HAAAAAAAAAAAA!” Disruptis roared, smashing a fist onto the already thoroughly abused table. His face contorted into a twisted grimace like that of a raving animal. The Tenno couldn’t properly express the emotion he was feeling at that moment as anything other than raw madness. The dead, the infighting, the threat looming so heavily on his shoulders he can’t even breathe. The loss, the pain, the failure. And above it all....

Disruptis lifted his head upwards, as if trying to stare daggers into the ceiling.

“This… is what you wanted, right?” he asked, still alone in the room.

Void energy began pooling in his body as Disruptis channeled it into his hands. The numerous scars etched all across his skin burned with a purplish intensity, lighting the operator up like a firefly.

Then the sun closed its lazy eye on the machinations of the remnants of a remnant.
