        >]<br />-Lua, Location of Vanished Tenno-<br />&lt;03/20 DR, 08:08&gt;<br /><br />~Lua&#39;s
        surface was quiet, if but for the soft winds caused by the distant Sol
        and its heat. The glow glimmered through the cracks and cave-ins of a
        tunnel that wound on and on, a low fog emanated out from the various
        Arboriforms weaving and out of the rock.<br /><br />Hoof prints were
        impressed in the dust-ridden surfaces of the region, blocked off by The
        Lotus due to hazards... The signs of struggling Tenno, of battle and
        wounds suffered, stained the monochrome palette of the Moon with red and
        bullet-impact black. Void burns and craters and rubble lined this narrow
        passage way.<br /><br />Long strides forward, hasty steps back : a bold
        vanguard, and a fearful retreat.<br /><br />Eventually, this tunnel
        opened up. Entering from a crack in the wall, the glows were replaced
        with an oppressive dark. Even the winding white roots struggled to cast
        light in the infernal black.<br /><br />In the distance, some hundred
        meters out, a panel flickered. Sparks spat out from beneath it, and a
        message was being relayed. The call of the Orokin Remnant... Jagged and
        stuttering like a broken somachord, it was less decipherable than
        before.<br /><br />Yet it shone more light upon the scene than anything
        else, that panel. The shadow of an angel, it stretched out across gilded
        steps and bone hued floors. Scatterings of casings and blood and gouges
        marred the flickering light like charred ribs.<br /><br />It was
        quiet... But for a soft hum and whistle coming from a constellation of
        twinkling red-orange lights just at the edge of the flickering
        light...~<br />[1/2]</span

        ><br /><br />&quot;Woooonder, a missing missing she...&quot;<br /></span
      ><span class="c0 c2"
        >Lekalis knelt, facing the panel, the cups laid infront of him; he
        stowed the iron capsule of water into his sash and procured a stem of
        Ruk&#39;s Klaw. He admired the scaley length with some sctutiny,
        checking it gently with both his hands before he began to peel away the
        scales to place one into each cup of sparkling water.</span
      ><span class="c0"
        ><br /><br />&quot;Deeeep in the sweet red... <br /></span
      ><span class="c0 c2"
        >He repeated this process, each cup turning a deeper shade of
        orangey-red with every scale placed within. Until the stem was stripped
        clean, and the cups of tea were all a sanguine ruby hue, though it
        twinkled still in the flickering light as small bubbles came and broke
        the surface on occasion.<br />The scales all but dissolved in the
        solution, The Strider sighed and crushed the stalk inbetween his palms;
        grinding it into a fine powder before he suddenly cast the dust out
        infront of him, sending a scattering of salt like strands into the air,
        to rest on the dusty, bloody and scarred floor...<br /><br />... He
        sighed, content at last, he rested his palms atop his lap and bowed his
        head. Murmuring, before he fell silent to meditation:</span

        Sequence is noted, but image an alliance where Steel Meridian is funded
        by Perrin Sequence. They would have the money to buy or build ships,
        weapons, train more soldiers, buy better armors and build stronger
        colonies. If we were to throw New Loka into the mix, they would be able
        to restore the planets we retake from the Grineer and Corpus, perhaps
        making them more habitable. I am unsure how the Arbiters of Hexis would
        come into play, but I do believe they would make good temporary colony
        leaders until a more formal system of governance can be

        ><br />&quot;I pursue this goal because I am tired of watching people
        fighting for the same or similar causes but rivalling each other. I
        desire harmony and unity among people with common goals, regardless of
        interests. Steel Meridian and Perrin Sequence have one thing in common,
        even if they have different methods with which to accomplish the goal.
        Steel Meridian takes a more combative approach to resolving conflict,
        where Perrin Sequence approaches conflict diplomatically. I do not know
        if you have met Ergo Glast in person, but he and the Sequence are not
        what the Meridian believes them to be. Squabbles such as the one between
        Meridian and Perrin Sequence are unecessary and fueled by a mere
        disagreement. Something that can in fact be rectified through a
        diplomatic conversation. Furthermore, if all of the syndicates are
        united early on, when the final battles between the major factions in
        the system end and peace is restored, the syndicates will have no need
        to fight with each other.&quot;<br /></span

        the Strider dug a nail of his Warframe inbetween the scale and stalk of
        the herb and gingerly coaxed a pale sinewy cylinder out from the thing.

        brewing the tea with practiced ease, the little finger of his good hand
        dipped into each as his prosthetic hand finished off the last of the
        root&#39;s pale sinewy stalk.<br /><br />As he stirred, each cup&#39;s
        brew skewed to a shade and some even brokered a color as the strands
        dissolved. A tawny hue stuck out from one, like clay. Another was a soft
        blueish hue, while the one next to it turned into an intense raspberry
        color. Beside that, one turned to a more cherry blossom tint, the next
        being somewhat mixed between an almost bubonic black, blue, and boney
        white.<br /><br />The last, Lekalis&#39; hand hesitated again, and he
        sighed; swiping the cup up and slipping a curious lid over it before
        stowing it in his sash.</span
