        >~Between broken rock, in the deep stone catacombs of Lua, a room of one
        of the Veiled rested. This room resembled a prison - crude bars once
        blocked its entrance on both sides, the Orokin tubular door had been
        sealed crudely with heavy plates of various metals. All of which, had
        been torn inward for ominous reasons, leading into a &nbsp;circular
        chamber. In the back of the chamber, was a Reservoir Pod. &nbsp;The
        room, unreasonably tall, had walls littered with chains, blades,
        shackles, collars, leg weights and a number of other primitive
        imprisoning tools dangling absentmindedly. Above was a massive steel
        sphere, that had protrusion dents all over it, hanging on a thick golden
        chain. The walls all around the chamber, and even over the many tools,
        paint laid dry. Orange, black, and various shades of red paint decorated
        the room&#39;s surface and items, smeared everywhere by hands that had
        taken their time to wipe every single inch. Hand marks littered the
        floor and ceiling in chaotic patterns, and a single set of footprints
        led their way to the Reservoir Pod, down the diameter of the room.
        &nbsp;Each footstep was outlined with white paint delicately, and in
        those boundaries a mix of all three colors were slathered by perhaps a
        brush. The Reservoir Pod beeped quietly; then it beeped, again. The
        Reservoir Pod beeps once more, and begins to emit a signal. A signal,
        requesting the pod be opened, echoed through Lua, displaying its
        location to those who cared to listen, among the broken stone<br /><br />
        The tall boy patiently waits, in slumber.~</span

        While you are out, would you pick up some more fruits for me?&quot;<br /></span
