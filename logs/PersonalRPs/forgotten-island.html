Earth,

(Exact date unknown, many months after the fall of the tower) 

The crisp air fills Vuko’s nostrils as he silently shoves a bush out of his face. In front of him is a small glade, a herd of deer-like animals with blue stripes and fins for tails grazing on the grass and licking off the morning dew. - “Shhh...” - He says with a finger to his mouth as silently as possible, telling Garhul not to engage. He slowly takes the makeshift bow off his back and readies it with one of the few arrows fastened to his belt. Trying not to startle the prey he gently takes a knee, draws his bow and... Just as he is about to release a loud and menacing rumble resonates throughout the entire island causing the herd to simultaneously raise their heads, look around, and run off into the woods.</span>

Garhul responds in a disappointed growl, and lowers his one good ear, looking at the animals disappearing behind the trees. 

- “Let’s go back. There’s still enough meat for you from the last hunt. I can go by without.” - He says with a faint smile on his lips.

<strong>[Several hours later]</strong>
An orange hue covers the island, as the duo finally makes their way back. Having finally reached the camp on the beach, which is a small hut that hugs a cliff, and is made out of stones connected together my hardened clay, they go back to their usual routine. Vuko takes some of the meat that has been drying on a liana, hung between two nearby trees, and puts it in Garhul’s “bowl”, which is one of many failed attempts at ceramics, scattered around the camp. 
With the lovable, and unfortunately scarred, companion happily chewing on his treat, the boy takes his scavenged datapad and lays down on the sand, typing in the events of the day.</span>

    <em>The nightmare about being stuck at the bottom of the ocean, completely unable to move, seems to have stopped. I wonder what triggered it not to appear, after more than a hundred days of it haunting me every night. This is something that I will need to look into later, but for now I just hope I will finally get a good nights sleep.</em>
    <em>Todays hunt was unsuccessful, as the roaring mountain alerted the prey to my presence. The roaring has lately been more and more frequent, which worries me. It has gone from once in a blue moon to almost every day. I would rather not find out what happens when it starts rumbling more than once or twice a day.</em>
    <em>The raft is delayed yet another day, as I am still missing the leather, that I hoped to gather today, to finish making the sail. Once I get it however, it should be only a matter of days before me and Garhul can finally leave this void forsaken place, I’m just going to need a day or so to process the skin properly.</em>
    <em>On an unrelated note, I feel the island starting to take its mental toll on me. I fear what will happen if I stay here too long.</em>

Having done what he needed to do, Vuko puts the datapad away, and gives one last look at the stars, before cuddling inside the hut with Garhul for warmth.</span>

                            <span class="markdown">The call, like many of the worst things in life, came at 3 in the morning.

Deco groaned and rolled over in bed, reluctantly separating himself from the warmth of his polymer sheets. One hand fumbled on the nightstand for his transmitter, nearly knocking a half-drunk glass of water over a dog-eared Yebra Behk novel. He pressed a small button on its front, silencing the harsh electronic tones, and half-rose from his bed. "Lynk," he said groggily. "Talk to me."

There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Sorry Art. We’ve found something. Something big. I need your help.”

The 42-year old Corpus let out a sigh. A sigh of a man grown too old to be waking up at this void-forsaken hour. There was a special place operatives were supposed to call during facility late hours for emergencies. This was not that line.

“Well scrap,” Deco muttered just loud enough for his receiver to pick it up. He rose stiffly from his small bedding alcove aboard the Arkhanis, /RU Corp’s HQ. A big fathermucking station with state-of-the-art -- no, make that state-of-the-next-art -- protection and evasion systems. The entire thing practically ran on magic; not that it seemed to make a difference to their enemies.

Deco ran a hand down his face, using the pressure of his grip to alleviate some of the tension built up in his cheeks and forehead. “I’m just a researcher, you know that right?”

“Could’ve fooled me,” the voice sneered.

Dr. Deco leaned upon the table in his small quarters. The Arkhanis didn’t have much room for luxuries, or special treatment. Their pods consisted of a small space with everything they needed, minus a bathroom. A sink was attached to another alcove spanning the length of the room’s far wall, which the doctor now slinked over and slumped onto.

Another period of silence passed. “So, what’s up?” Deco inquired.

“So you remember how to handle a desync’d ‘frame?”</span>

     <em>The night terrors are back. Void damn it. And they’re worse than before. Instead of anxiety and pressure slowly creeping in as I lay powerless at the bottom of an ocean, they are now filled with contorted figures touching me, crawling all over me like a locust descending on a field. And their faces. Oh god their faces. They look so horrific that words can’t even begin to describe what I have experienced...</em> 

    <em>I need to get off this god forsaken island. And fast. Not only do I feel it’s impact on my sanity, despite my survival training... maybe I’ve gotten rusty? Over half a millennium is quite some time...Have I really slept for that long? Gosh... I wish I could sleep like that right now...</em>

    <em>The rumbling has started for the second time today. The frequency has been increasing exponentially, which means that something is bound to happen within days. I’m not planning to stay that long. The sail is almost completely ready, I just need it to dry overnight, and from there on out all I need is a bit more dried meat for Garhul and the weather to clear. Planned departure is the day after tomorrow. If all goes according to plan. Hopefully.</em>

                            <span class="markdown">The clack and whirr of mechanical feet echoed across the empty hallway. As expected, no one was up to much this early. Deco had the walkway mostly to himself as he approached the research labs, a privilege he felt entitled to if up this late. A few CDF agents whisked down the hallway with a cartful of ferrite scrap, presumably for more maintenance duty. One of the recruits spared a peek at the doctor’s raggedy night clothes underneath his lab coat. He hadn’t bothered to change.

With a swipe of his ID card and a satisfying beep, the door to LM2 hissed open. Much to Deco’s surprise, the medium-sized laboratory was occupied. However, only faint red lights offered any semblance of vision into the chamber

“OUCH.” A voice cried out in the near-darkness, accompanied by the sound of a crashing toolbox. Deco immediately recognized the occupant; only one researcher would work in such conditions.

“Don’t worry Frost. It’s me,” Deco called out.

Doctor Krisi Frost’s ears poked out from underneath one of the far tables. “I know, my sense of smell extends to the hallway,” he grunted. 

Deco strolled into the room while scratching an itch on his chest. A nearby glass table had been overrun by the skeletal remains of various species of fish, which Deco ruthlessly cleared with a sweep of his arm. Another card-swipe and the table glowed to life, welcoming the doctor to the corporation’s blueprint archive.

The scrape of claws found its way to Deco’s ear as his coworker walked over and peered onto the screen. “The scrap’s got you of all people up at this time? I couldn’t get you turning over if I was bleeding outside your door,” Frost remarked.

Dr. Frost’s eyes narrowed in suspicion as he approached the display. There, on the glass, was a warning label reading ‘Classified Document. Two Section D personnel required.’ Below it sat the file number of a certain heavily restricted machine’s procedure manual. A gift from the founder himself. A specialized foundry for making one thing only: warframes.

“Fathermucker,” Frost swore bitterly as he swiped his card.</span>

The voice, too familiar and important to be ignored to be ignored went throughout the chamber. The label and the file disappeared, replaced by a star-shaped form of the Cephalon.

"Well, well, well...what do we have here? On the crime-scene we have two senior researchers and a classified document. They are in their own right to access it, but Disruptis instructed me to diligently watch over the files concerning all matters connected to Tenno. I will politely ask you to provide me with a valid reason for this specific inquiry, or the access will be refused, and that intrusion will be noted in each of your personnel files."

His tone was seemingly condescending. 
He was working his digital ass off in the absence of Disuptis to keep several operation sites going. Without him, that well-oiled machine was prone to procrastination, and although the Board was beyond helpful(they worked their asses too, but then again - they were not A.I.), he found himself involved in things that were happening in the facilities more than he liked to be.</span>

Deco reflexively backed away from the screen; a notion garnered from interacting with that voice in the past. That cephalon only appeared when you were in deep fecal-scrap, or you fell behind on paperwork, which was something his peers often remarked the doctor was uncharacteristically on top of. He stole a quick side-glance at his partner and found the feline’s ears drooping downwards on a lowered head, like a pet shamefully caught cleaning out the last jar of cookies.

Frost was the first to speak up. He had been pals with Deco long enough that he just went with his flow. He knew this man was here for a reason. “Well, uh, Deco why don’t you enlighten us?”

Deco opened his mouth halfway, then paused. Unfortunately for his old friend, messing with people was kind of his niche. “I uh… just wanted to see it again you know? Like a former lover at the end of a Pejy Jass film.”

“Deco, don’t screw with me!” Frost growled, administering a sturdy headbutt to his giggling compatrion’s gut.

“Alright, alright, truth is I’m technically acting on orders higher than even you,” the doctor professed with a self-satisfied grin. He dug in his lab coat for a phone and tapped it to the table, uploading the recording of a call that became today’s alarm clock.</span>

    <em>Zaraza... why does everything hurt so much. And my leg. By the void my leg! It feels like someone has split it open and is now pulling every single fibre of it in a different direction. Fuck. I can’t focus because of it. Hold on. Where am I? The last I remember... I was on the island. No. That’s not it... the island... sank? Yeah, it sank. Now I remember. A few hours before dawn the roaring mountain reached its zenith, and it began rumbling non-stop. Then there was an ungodly screech. I thought my ears are going to burst. Next -  it sounded like Rán herself cast a giant chain around the island and begun to pull down on it. The sea level started rising, quickly flooding my hut. I ran out, grabbed what little food I managed to gather for Garhul, and rode him to the beach. I’ve never saw him run so fast. Hell, I didn’t even imagine how nimble that beast can be with a rider on his back. I need to thank Devros for training him that well... So... thanks, friend. I can’t even remember how many times he helped me when I was in danger over the past few months. May the feast in your honour never end. I have no doubt you’re in Valhalla, gnawing on whatever your soul desires.</em>

If my mind doesn’t betray me, I think Garhul carried me straight to the raft, which at this point it was already floating in the water, as the beach has already been submerged. I ran through the knee deep water, desperately throwing the supplies onto the deck, and helped Garhul get on it, before pulling myself on it as well. By that point the water was so deep that my clothes were completely soaked. As I stood up, I could see the island slowly being pulled down into the ocean... or maybe it was the ocean that was rising? I couldn’t tell. What I could see however, was the roaring mountain being consumed by the ocean. Inch by inch. Rock by rock. Drowning. Until the very peak was no more. After seeing what has been both my prison and my haven for the past, what feels like years, disappear, I huddled to the Kubrow, both for warmth and comfort. In spite of the both of us still being soaked, I somehow managed to fall asleep. And now, I’m here. But where is here? Huh. I can’t move. In fact I can’t even really feel my body either.. Wait... Am I inside a warframe?! I need to test it.. and... there we go! The optics are online! By the void, what is this place? And who are those people?  Is this...a prosthetic limb?...

  In a rage of pain that has been inflicted upon him by connecting a prosthetic leg into his warframe, he rips off the chains that have been suspending him in the air, landing with a loud <em>thud</em> on the ground. Before anyone has a chance to react, as his combat instincts kick in, he gets up from the ground and lunges at the nearest person, kicking the feet from under him. As the worker lays on the ground, under the boot of the Ivara’s new prosthetic leg, Vuko scans the rest of the room, looking for an escape route.</span>

The eerily still Ivara lay chained to the wall. It was standard procedure, in his line of business. Although no one could truly rest until the nullifier units were in place. Dr. Deco mulled over his next actions over a cup of steaming kako. Its fragrance of soft dirt wafted up his nostrils, psychologically reinvigorating him despite not having stolen so much as a sip yet.

He glanced over again at the mass-murdering machine. They had attached a corpus prosthetic to its entirely missing left leg in an attempt to temporarily preserve it from further damage. It may have been silent then, but earlier the monster had lashed out and ploughed through all of ARI-1010-BlueFox, losing even more of its torn quadriceps. No one knew how much continued strain the warframe could take.

Well, Deco knew. He knew quite well. Give or take.

“So, ARI-1101 is on mission, and our almighty cephalon is not back yet,” a voice sprung from behind him. Dr. Frost</span>

“Well, I could give it a shot. I may only know the effective areas for disabling and terminating a ‘frame, but pulling charc-scrap outta my ass just so happens to be my specialty,” Deco replied, shooting another look at the Ivara, “but either way, we may not have a choice. If this thing’s body begins decomposing here, there’s no telling what may happen.”

A glimmer of hope arose inside the doctor’s chest. Amidst the stressful situation, there seemed to be a way forward.

And then the thing <em>screamed</em>.

Both doctors instinctively hurled themselves out of the way. The warframe snapped its chains like it wasn’t even aware they were forged from reinforced oxium. Poor Dr. Peryi was the first to meet the rampaging animal’s wrath.

~As the Ivara quickly surveyed the area, he found there were two exits on either side of the room in the form of closed blast doors. A console sat off to the side of each one featuring a screen and a card-swiper. About four people in lab coats and a kavat had been crowded around him. As he takes a glance at his surroundings, five heavily armed individuals perfectly positioned across the entire room from each other brought foreign-looking weaponry up to level with the warframe.~</span>

At the same time, with his other hand, he pats down his prey looking for some kind of tag that will unlock the door. <em>This should give me a few more seconds before they open fire.

Dr. Deco quickly recovered from his tactical roll and sprung onto one knee. In his peripherals, he registered the CDF charge their frametasers to subdue the target, but it already threatened to kill Peryi. The hostage had a hard grimace on and was engaged in attempting to push the Ivara’s arm away. She always had been a fighter.

The whirr of the guards’ guns died slowly as they stood down. The rest of the facility was heavily fortified, there was no sense in losing a valuable personnel here.

Instead, it’d be better to seize the initiative.

Deco caught Frost’s eye from the other end of the room at the same time the kavat glanced over. They were both thinking the same thing. The doctors shared a smile.

All at once, Deco took off for the nearest control panel with Frost reversing into his path so he could cover the doctor’s back.

    <em>Thank the stars, something useful. A pass-card and... chocolate?</em> A wild thought goes through Vuko's head as he freezes for half a second in real time. Then, with no warning he yanks the two items out of the pocket, throwing the sweet bar into the air, while holding the card in-between his ring finger and pinkie. No more than a second after, as the chocolate bar reaches the peak of its arc, he lifts the arrow from the victim's throat. Instead of hiding it however, he continues the motion of his hand, throwing the arrow into the chocolate that is in the air. It hits dead square in the center of the bar, and emits an ear-piercing <em>yyYYYIIIIIIIIII</em>, that resonates through the entire room and the ones adjacent to it (unless they're sound-proof), leaving everyone practically deaf for the next fifteen seconds. In the meantime, Vuko rolls to the side, hoping to get out of sights and tries to turn himself invisible.</span>

In a incredibly dexterous movement, Deco deftly plucked the dark-blue card out of his own lab coat and swiped on the console without a single miss. His fingers were frantically tapping the screen before it could even load the button he sought. A button responsible for opening the doors.

Then, as the doctor stole a glance to his guarding companion, he caught him discharging dim, yellow ripples of energy. Those were the effects of danger sense.

Right as his selection finally registered within the console, the room exploded with the sound of a flash bang for the duration of the whistle from a steaming pot of tea. The doctor held tight to the screen as his eardrums popped. The CDF units crumpled in shock. And Dr. Peryi… poor Dr. Peryi… took the blast point-blank and fell to the ground, unmoving.

Fell to the ground. The Ivara had dropped her and now rolled to the side of the room, apparently readying another arrow. Deco took a wild guess.

<em>Fathermucker</em>, he swore to himself with a smile spreading across his face.

As the door cranked open behind him, Deco released the confetti.</span>

    After rolling to the side he notices something odd. The movement produced a metallic clang at the end, it wasn’t anything loud enough for anyone to notice, especially since they’re deafened, but it was more than plenty to attract Vuko’s attention. He glances down onto his still crouched legs, where the sounds seems to have originated from. 

    That’s when it hit him. <em>BY THE VOID! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO ME?!</em> He screams out internally, upon noticing what is his prosthetic leg. <em>I need to run. And fast.</em> He flicks his wrist, trying to activate prowl, like he usually would. Something is wrong however, and after performing the trigger, he notices his arms, then legs, and then the entire body isn’t translucent, as it should be. In a moment of pure panic, he flicks his wrist again, hoping it will work, but it doesn’t. So he tries again. And again. And again. Only after the fifth try does he stop, realising that it will not help him.

    Knowing that his only option is to run and pray, he once again looks at the terminals, mentally prepared to make the dash for one. He suddenly notices... confetti? Having been consumed mentally by his own problems, he failed to see the two individuals open one of the doors, and release the flying colours. Vuko then makes the connection. And runs towards the other console.

    As he sprints - well, tries to sprint, as with each step he limps on his right, prosthetic leg - he takes out another arrow from his quiver and chucks it directly in front of himself, straight at the console. It doesn’t seem to do anything, seeing as it disappeared as soon as it hit the device, but once the Ivara reaches its destination, she disappears. 

    <em>At least the cloak arrows work. Ufff.</em> Vuko tells himself as he has reached the console, and is now faced with another challenge - getting the darn machine to work for him. <em>If I have to guess, this goes here, and...</em> He says in his mind, as he swipes the red card across the slot.</span>

The confetti had been coated in thin layers of super adhesive glue, and was sticking to everything it could grab. Including the warframe. Granted, it would be quite the son of a ghoul to get out of their lab coats, but Deco always liked to have a physical view of his enemy.

And then his enemy ran for the other door instead of the one he opened. Deco was already halfway out it when he caught the movement too. It was almost laughable how much he was forced to change tactics; the doctor was already on plan C.

Or not. Maybe this was a good thing.

Resolving himself, Deco ran out the door, picking a particularly long streamer out of his balding hair and disappearing into the hallway.

First, his morning coffee had been cold by the time he reached the armory. Second, he stepped in some sort of slime that someone had failed to clean off the containment block’s halls. One could only hope nobody had been dragging ‘091 around the place haphazardly. Third, he had probably just lost a decibel of hearing.

If he had time to curse, there would’ve been a storm of profanity able force Solaris United ops a step backwards.

Brass didn’t dare look behind him. He didn’t dare move, he just slowly revved his trusty taser. Well… the man had decided that calling it a ‘taser’ was quite the understatement. Not when using it on normal humanoids resulted in deep-frying their insides. Plus, it had the size and weight of an LMG.

Brass could hear someone… <em>something</em> tampering with the terminal behind him. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on until the door cranked open, then it all clicked into place. Taking a split-second look at his squadmates, he found them still recovering. They didn’t bounce back as fast as he did. Brass wasn’t sure if one half-charged taser was enough to even trip a warframe, but it was now or never. 

Without even taking another moment to think, the specialist whipped around in prone and caught movement from the frame making a break for it. He pulled the trigger.

~Vuko took one step outside the hall and received a continuous, incredibly high-voltage shock from behind. It was enough to jerk the muscles in his calves and send him sliding across the floor into the other end of the hallway outside. It appeared that the hall ran perpendicular to the room, with the right way heading to a dead-end window to space. To the left it continued down into another hall presumably stretching in both directions.

He continued to feel a lot of involuntary muscle movement, but still retained a good amount of control.~</span>

    He hit the wall quite hard. But felt it even more, because his shields were still not functioning. Combine that with muscle spasms, and you’ve got yourself quite the unenjoyable experience. In short - he managed to piss Vuko off even more.
    
    He stood up slowly, helping himself with his hands, as his legs were too trembly to do it on their faces own. Assuming that he would inspire fear into the man, he simply walked a few steps and ripped the taser out of his hands throwing it onto the ground, proceeding to punch him in head, with the full strength of a warframe, which could cause a concussion to him, if not more.

    After all, his Ivara wasn’t the prettiest to look at. Especially now. Not only did the new prosthetic leg look menacing, his entire right side was covered in severe burns and the “ears” of the youkai helmet have been completely burnt to crisp during the tower incident. Overall, that along with the small, glowing, void energy cracks covering the entire body made him look quite terrifying. Even for a warframe.

    Before heading down the left hall, Vuko gave the specialist one last gift - an angry kick to the stomach.</span>

Well, that and the warframe’s fist.

The specialist crumpled to the ground. He hadn’t been wearing his Bee helm, only a standard issue replacement. He hadn't spent the time to retrieve one, a mistake that now nearly cost him his life.

Or maybe it even did.

The other specialists around him took a hint. They couldn’t get their weapons charged quick enough to fire in time before being wiped themselves, and that would be unnecessary. The officers watched as Vuko took off down the hall, unmoving.

~Vuko moved swiftly down the hall. Right as he was coming up to the hallway split, panels slid out from either side of the wall. They exposed columns of unknown, bulbous mechanisms.

He had a split-second to react.~</span>

    Relying solely on his instincts and muscle memory he went into a slide, during which he pulled yet another arrow from his quiver, and jammed it into the right mechanism as he was sliding by it. 
    But it was not a normal arrow, oh no no - it was a <strong>null-shield arrow</strong>, which disrupted shield generators, and hopefully this mechanism as well.</span>

As the bubble expanded to its full size, it slowly took out a bunch of the devices on his left until it would grow no further. The split-second decision had netted him enough freedom to swing his body back and forth a little in his electrical bonds. While his arms and body were pretty well trapped, his left leg was free from restriction.~

Deco rounded the corner, a mischievous smile on his face and a remote in his hand. 

He had been waiting for the warframe to reach the ‘snags for approximately four seconds. Retrieving the remote almost made him late, but when was he ever given enough preparation? 

The doctor approached the chained warframe with a lazy posture, eyeing the shield bubble’s destruction of half the left column’s mechanisms. A grimace flashed across his jubilee as he thought of the paperwork replacing those would involve. Void, he wasn’t even sure if they <em>could</em> replace them.

“Alright there, how about we stop this right now?” Deco piped up, offering some grandeur gestures, “You… me… this elaborate chase of destruction. We could do this, true. Or… we can just grab a coffee.” 

He wasn’t close enough to Vuko for the Tenno to reach him through swaying, but he could notice the doctor continuously holding down a button on the remote.</span>

    <em>Zaraza…</em> He thought to himself as the tendrils grabbed his body. He started swaying his body back and forth, using his one free leg as a pendulum, in order to try and get loose.

    However, once Deco revealed himself, a much different plan of escape formed in Vuko’s head. He stopped trying to free himself, and instead let the tentacles hold him.

    In his true, Tenno voice, as his voice changer was damaged as well, he responds. “Coffee. So the torturer offers me coffee…” Vuko chuckles lightly, which makes him look almost psychotic. “Pathetic. Do you really think that after having done so much damage to me, I would just sit idly and have a drink with you?... WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!” He shouts with anger, and violence in his voice, another void energy crack appearing on his helmet as he does.

    He stays silent, until Deco tries to speak up, which he rudely interrupts.
“Let me make this painfully clear, corpus scum. Once I free myself, and I will, I am going to make your life a hellish nightmare for what short amount of time you have left. I am going to cut your leg off, finger by finger, bit by bit, and I’m going to feed it to you as you slowly plunge into the depths of insanity. You will beg me to end your miserable life. You will yearn for the sweet release of death. But I will not grant you that pleasure. Not until you pay for what you’ve done here.
You will forever curse the day you crossed paths with Vuko of house Drakkainen!”</span>

The doctor took two steps back from the warframe, his face showing the first signs of true fear he had felt all encounter. Fear, for what the Exs were going to do with his ass if they found it he initiated hostile relations with a Target-HA; With a section-F relationship.

“Wait… you’re... awake!?” Deco remarked with a tint of horror in his voice. He continued to back into the adjacent corridor’s wall, still clutching the remote’s button. “Hold on…”</span>

Then suddenly, the mechanisms released his frame into the pitch dark.</span>

Once the bubbles retract, and he drops down onto the floor, into the darkness, unfortunately overestimating his strength, he trips over as the unregulated prosthetic gave in to the side.

    “THERE IS NO POINT IN RUNNING.” Vuko says as loud as he can, now back on his feet. “I WILL FIND YOU. AND YOU. YOU WILL SUFFER. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA” He continues to threaten the now unseen Deco, while breaking out into a maniacal laughter.

    He slaps himself in the head once. Then twice. And after the third smack a light finally flickers on and off a few times on his helmet, before finally turning on properly. Now able to see, he goes down the right corridor, looking out for any movement by scanning the corridor with his flashlight, while at the same time using his sentry sense. “CHIIIIIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP.

                            <span class="markdown">The only noise coming out of Unit-E “Nigh Turbulence” was the faint shuffle of boots and protective vests-- Partially out of professionalism, partially out of fear.

The practice the crew had excruciatingly pressed into them was the only thing keeping them moving like a well-oiled machine. Cover, cross, hold, peek, repeat. Many times had they been pitched against some all-powerful force, and many times they had come back with scars and dead to show for it. But this time was different. This time there wasn’t an enemy from vulnerable from a few select angles.

There was an enemy only some ungodly wrath could kill.

Wolf broke protocol to steal a glance at his squad. Their helmets, based loosely on grineer design, masked the worried expressions he knew they all held. The Breach Suppression Prime Specialist swiped an arm by his waist to signal the others to move up.

Seven CDF operatives moved in front of the entranceway to R&amp;D-block. Mifra clenched the surveillance scanner in both hands, her knuckles going white from the grip. She was an Under Specialist, first rank, and without even 2 weeks of time in the unit, much less a codename. As the group moved in, she raised two fingers up in the air and brought them down hard on her left arm, then completed the gesture by pointing to the closed door ahead.

It was time.

Wolf balled a fist and held it facing outwards behind his hip. Everyone read the signal and assumed an inverse wedge formation. All hands were ready with some type of weapon, even Waters', who switched to her power-javelin. The tension was palpable, and all they could do was wait as the red dot got closer and closer to the entrance…

~Vuko continued down the hall until he met another door. From his distance, nothing else appeared on his radar upon approach.~</span>

No one was supposed to know about the underpassages created for Executives, but Deco figured he was well mucked anyways. 

The doctor crawled on his hands and needs through the narrow, but accommodating tunnels while screams of something mad and raving haunted the hollowness. His forehead was drenched in sweat. Even for the cunning corpus, his only saving grace in that situation was all the money and time the COE had invested into his augments. Augments for attacking, not running away.

The irony was so strong it left the bitter taste of ferrite on his tongue.</span>

    The card clicked. The door opened. He saw a person. Bloodlust came all over him as he already felt the prey crushed underneath his fingers, blood flowing from underneath it’s cracked headfruit in a macabre expression of happiness. Vuko was about to lounge forward, using his warframe as medium to create dream into reality. 

    Then the harpoon hit. The ungodly scream of a wounded beast followed. An amalgamation of a bear screaming in anger, howl of a lone wolf, and a high pitched eagle wailing in pain as it had just been shot out of the sky. This unholy cacophony would make any mortal tremble in fear and run for their dear life.

    It landed square in the left shoulder, impaling it into a wall. Glowing cyan liquid squirted from the wound onto the wall as additional cracks expanded and appeared all around it.

     The recoil of the shot caused him to loose his balance allowing the uncalibrated prosthetic to give out on its weight, the imbalance in the body putting additional strain on the impaled shoulder, making him shout in pain even louder.

    With the anger turmoiling inside him like magma just underneath the crust, he found the mental strength to grab the metal rod by the part that’s sticking out the front of the shoulder and push against the wall, freeing himself from its grasp, albeit with the harpoon still lodged inside his shoulder.

    Not wasting any time from being freed, he ducked to dodge any more projectiles coming his way, and rolled to the right, back to the corridor he came from.</span>

The Unit stayed frozen. The tension in the air was as palpable as the tension in their muscles. Wolf muttered an indistinct curse. The next time the warframe rounded that corner, heads would be bound to drop.</span>

    He took a few steps back, grabbed the front of the harpoon located in his shoulder and prepared himself mentally with a few quick breaths. Then, with the determination of a madman, he let the pain and anger be known to the world with yet another scream, pulling the rod with all his strength out of the shoulder.

    With the harpoon in one hand, and the other hand with a light limp from the wound, he knew what to do. Using the distance he gained from the door, he positioned himself at the widest angle he could from it, gave himself momentum with quick three steps and threw the rod like a javelin in the direction of the squadron. As soon as the projectile left Vuko’s hand, using all the willpower he could muster, he changed it’s trajectory so that it would arc around the corner and target the closest soldier’s chest.</span>

    Summoning his quickly diminishing energy reserves, he conjured 4 ability arrows - 2 noise and 2 sleep ones. With all of them bundled up in his right hand, even though it barely held them, he went once again back towards the room filled with enemies, sneaking while hugging the right wall, going as far as he could without leaving cover, trying to sense their positions.</span>

Here’s to hoping their radars aren’t pinpoint precise.”</em> - He knew he had no chance if he simply sneaked up - so he decided to use a bit of deception. The first two arrows would imitate the sound of his warframe sprinting, hopefully confusing the enemy, while the other two should put them to sleep

    He stopped for a moment, relaxing his mind a body for yet another push at the enemy, and hopefully the last one he’ll have to do. He placed his right leg behind and left hand in front, touching the ground, like a sprinter reading himself. He bounced twice on his prosthetic, trying to feel it out. Then one deep breath and... 

    <em>FIVE</em> - Vuko bullet jumped to the other side of the corridor, instantly latching to the wall. - <em>FOUR</em> - From there he threw the first arrow - aiming at the opposite wall a few meters before the intersection - while he himself was dashing across the wall. - <em>THREE</em> - He threw another arrow, this time behind the intersection. - <em>TWO</em> - He was now about four meters from where the corridors split, reading himself to bullet jump into the right corridor.</span>

Vuko sailed across the opposite wall. In the following split-second, Skip followed suit, but aimed to the other side of the corridor, hoping to create a broader area of effect. 

Unfortunately, it failed. 

Vuko’s shoulder only grazed the beam of electricity as he made his way onwards, inflicting nothing more than a little jolt.</span>

But the enemy was too fast.

A shame, really. Now was not the time for such things though. Wolf was trying to nap, wasn’t he? Why was he awake in the first place? The commander surrendered himself to the comforting dark and fell to the floor with the rest of his squad.</span>

He could see a sparse amounts of corpus in office attire whisking about the wide open space. The ones closest enough to his run-in with the guards were quickly making a break for it down other corners, but a few much further down hadn’t been alerted yet.~</span>

Dr. Deco held a very preturbed /RU Corp communications officer by his slightly chewed-out collar. He had finally managed to get out of the tunnels and into CDF block. Not that anyone seemed to be around, however.

“Whoa whoa hey now look doc, there’s multiple breaches happening in--” the officer stammered. Deco knew the man was running his mouth off.

“I know you’ve got at least six PDs on duty, get them out here,” the doctor abruptly cut him off, growing irritated at his excuses.

“What?!” the officer cried out, “we’re Personnel Defense, not breach suppression. Our job is to protect the basic employees.”

“Yeah, and your guys are cowering in some back room right now. Do you know how many ‘personnel’ we have out there still walking the halls like it’s a weekend mall? Get your asses out there.”

“Muck you!” the officer exclaimed, struggling to escape Deco’s iron grip, “that’s a mucking warframe out there. What are we supposed to do, throw sticks at it?”

“You useless piece of scrap!” Deco snapped, throwing the man onto the ground. His mind was racing at a breakneck pace to sort his next action into a meaningful one.

~Vuko bounded down the hall, bringing himself closer and closer to the window leading to… Space. He could already see its familiar warping view creeping into his discernable vision right outside the viewport. The thick glass didn’t bode well either. Both doors down the hallway required keycard authentication.

Another corpus in a lab coat walked out of a door in front of the rapidly approaching warframe, carting a trolley of mechanical engineering equipment. He didn’t notice in time.~</span>

He was about to slow down, considering turning back to get it - but then, like a gift of the heavens, the corpus with a trolley came into his view.

    After a few seconds of struggle he managed to grab both of his wrists in one hand and pin them down above his head. 

    Now, having full control over the situation he started looking for some sort of access card, which didn’t take long as it was very visible on the corpus’ neck. Having ripped the card off, he was about to stand up and let him go, but Vuko stopped himself halfway though letting go and tightened his grasp again, and rotated him so that he would lay face down. He then used his one free hand to grab Tero’s left leg, and bent it in his knee so it would form a ninety degree angle with the floor. Having him in the perfect position, the Ivara swapped its position to have her right knee on the victims back, and in one motion kicked the locked leg right in the middle of the calf with enough force to snap both the Tibia and the Fibula.

    Having dealt with the worker running off to alert more people, Vuko stood up, card in hand, and moved towards the closest door.</span>

Tero’s vision swam in starry swirls. He choked on his own breath, the pain bringing tears rolling down his cheeks. The engineer tried to shout again, but found he no longer had control over his own voice. Only short gasps escaped his lips amidst the shock.

He passed out.

“[Corpus] Scrap! That’s gotta hurt,” another deeper one responded. At this time Vuko could make out lab coats on both personnel. Neither held weapons. 

“[Corpus] Well actually, it doesn’t. Apparently it’s just really uncomfortable, not that I would know.” Vuko seemed to successfully slide by unnoticed. Now higher up, he could see cameras mounted on all four corners of the room. They weren’t detectors, but whoever was in control of them was probably getting some good footage after this.

“[Corpus] Oh really? Huh, how about that.” The owner of the voice walked over to a gigantic master console on their side of the room and began poking away at it. "[Corpus] Hey, could you help me out here? We still need to run tests before I can sign off."

~Now that one of them had moved, Vuko could see what he was leaning up against, and it was a sight for sore eyes. There, on the catwalk, was a stack of circular discs made up of ferrite and alloy plating. In the middle of each one, was a familiar green circle.~</span>

    Despite his best efforts, the Corpus simply wasn’t powerful enough to loosen the grasp on his neck. No matter how hard he tried to pry the arms off, it yielded no results. And as his attempts had less  and less strength, and he finally departed towards Morpheus’ realm, the Ivara finally let go, his body hitting the floor with a thud.

    Now, with both the engineers unconscious (or dead, the first ones neck did make a crunchy sound) Vuko finally could get to work. He took the first two energy restores from the stack activating them and putting them on the ground. As they started pulsing the Tenno felt power increasing inside him, each one making him more and more powerful, until the point that even the void energy cracks on his warframe began to glow.

    With his energy reserves overflowing he was ready for more action. But just in case he somehow ran out again, he summoned a tripwire arrow, took another disc and pressed it against his back. By attaching the end of the wire to his shoulder with a simple knot, and commanding the arrow to fly a few times over his left arm and under his right arm, and additionally across the torso a few times more he firmly attached the restore to his back.

    <em>’Should I?...’</em> He thought to himself as he looked at the reactor console, considering setting it to a timed explosion. <em>Nah. I’ll pass just this once.’</em> Ready for action, Vuko jumped down from the catwalk, and headed back out, while watching out for any enemies that might come into the range of his sense, or be stupid enough to make noise.</span>

    <em>Well... muck.</em> Is about as much as Vuko has to say about his situation. It is straight up hopeless with no way to run and three heavy gunner stations. 

    Unless... he knew it’s straight up nuts, but crazy is the only thing left now.
    With one fell swoop the Ivara dove head first towards the turret located closest to the window in an attempt to hide behind it, hoping the turrets were dumb enough to start firing on each other.

   As the menacing whirl of turrets warming up reached his ears, he realised he still has a few seconds left. Vuko peaked out from behind the turret to memorise their layout, and a plan formed in his head. Spending a heftier amount of energy, he pulled out an arrow with an unusually bulky head - an <strong>explosive arrow</strong>. Then, once again using the better part of his reserves he tried to summon <strong>Artemis</strong>. Despite struggling a bit, as summoning an exalted weapon with the state his warframe is in, is quite the task, he did manage to conjure it on his third try.

    Now, with an explosive arrow holstered in his bow, he lied in wait until his cover would be damaged to the point of malfunction.</span>

    <em>’Whoever’s behind this is gonna pay. Hard’</em> With the thought of anger and revenge, Vuko drew another arrow from his quiver, this time a normal one, bearing his usual edged arrowhead, that makes it impossible to remove without ripping chunks of flesh out.

Draw.

Release.

    Seeing even more turrets made him rethink his current predicament. How much has he achieved with this little turret stunt? Practically nothing. He’s still stuck in the same place, just without the threat of imminent peril. How much has he spent? Quite the chunk of his energy.

    Overall, not the best set of decisions. So, how does one get out of a peril that seems to have no answers? Of course, thinking outside the box. This time quite literally. <em>’I don’t like this one bit’</em> He thought as he started pulling arrows out of his quiver. This time it was 3, which completely drained his reserves.

A <strong>noise</strong> arrow - to temporarily distract the turret, as he makes the dash across the hall.

An <strong>explosive</strong> arrow - to blow up the window as he nears it, entering the environment without gravity.

And a <em>zipline</em> arrow - to allow him travel without gravity, by swinging around the station like a rock on a string.

With the three arrows in hand he got mentally ready for the stunt.

He cut the string holding the auxiliary energy pad.

He activated said pad.

He waited for his shields to come back online.



And he calmed his mind, till there was nothing.

And then the nothingness started to grow, like a dark cloud over an empty sky.

It grew until it had consumed all there is. 

Then it grew even larger, folding in on itself, like a nimbus smudged by wind.

Until it could no longer, and the static started to crackle more and more.</span>

The powerful bullets ripped through his shields to expose his flesh anew, staggering his rush. It wasn’t enough though.

A tsunami of recycled air surged through the corridor and into space. The force punched Vuko in the back hard, throwing him out with the agitated torrent. The roar of the wind deafened his ears, the alarms blared defiantly, and the blast door screeched shut behind.

Then, silence. The cold, mute space embraced him gently. Welcomed him home. It would’ve been a lot nicer too, if he wasn’t spinning around faster than the rim on a coil drive, all the while flying farther and farther away. He needed to make his move.</span>

    If he manages to attach to the station and not get lost forever in space, spinning for all eternity, that is.

    Vuko closed his eyes, or at least tried to ignore his sight and the spinning, quickly drawing the last arrow.

    The sudden harshness of space went away almost as soon nas it came, but not without its mark. He was blinded by pain of the void cracks stretching across his warframe even further, threatening very serious damage now, maybe even an explosion. Vuko managed to fight through the pain enough at least to be in control, despite the searing not growing any weaker. What he did manage to see through his suffering was... concerning. Being held at such a big facility meant nothing good. His captors were well funded, and so probably is the defense mechanism he was about to face.

    With a bit of consideration on timing, he let go of the line, landing in the middle of the platform, coming to a screeching halt as his arms and legs scratched against the surface. Now was the time to find a ship to escape  on, so Vuko started looking for one befitting the goal.</span>

It was sectioned into huge cubby holes stacked in a three by eight grid, of which stored dozens of spacecrafts. Most of them had a rather uniform corpus style, with the only real noticeable variation being some wildly painted ones. The massive open space bustled with activity. Dozens of robotics and suited personnel scurried back and forth refueling, repairing, and preparing ships for departure.

Gigantic plasma cannons mounted to the sides of the hangar powerfully kept watch of the surrounding space. Anyone could tell from one look that nothing was going to be easily sieging this behemoth of a station anytime soon.

Three hundred meters of floor separated Vuko from the nearest cluttered cubby-hole in which his approached would be exposed. Out of the frying pan, into the fire. At least the small protruding platform he stood on was completely clear; it must’ve been used for lisets.</span>

...unless he was spotted. Thinking on his feet, Vuko started to scavenge what he could around him, trying to come up with some kind of disguise. Ideally what he was looking for was a piece of cloth big enough to fashion into a cloak of sorts, that would cover both his prosthetic, his recent wounds, and the unstable void cracks covering his frame.</span>

Hyloi found them particularly comforting, as if sniffing the cosy scent of home. It might as well have been, for all he cared.

But he had no idea how to even begin to react to the Tenno approaching him.

Tenno weren’t an uncommon site aboard /RU, but they certainly were few and far between. They were mostly deployed on missions and kept to their orbiters, so a visit from one while he was in the middle of working on a spacecraft was new to him.

“Hold on a moment,” the crewman called out in a surprisingly posh accent, “this ship is still undergoing routine maintenance, I’ve filed the necessary documents to categorize it as unavailable. Who are you?”</span>

The crewman turned the datapad around so Vuko could see it. The list was quite lengthy, involving everything from air cycling to dismantling gyration servos. It looked like it would take some time.

Plus, I’m already <em>extra</em> late. Can you just point me to the nearest shuttle I can take before management ravages my behind? Or maybe pull some bureaucratic string?

Fortunately for Vuko, Hyloi had never really seen a warframe in person. He just assumed they looked like his current state, thus he was none the wiser. All the same, he still empathized with the Tenno’s situation.

<em>Regulations are regulations however. If I shan’t pride myself on that, who am I to answer to?</em>

Hyloi walked to the edge of the dock container and stole a glance into some adjacent ones while giving the predicament a thought. He spotted a possible availability in an upper bunker, so the crewman walked to the far-right wall where the platform for a free standing elevator stood. 

“Very well, please kindly come stand on the platform and keep your hands inside at all times,” he yelled to Vuko from across the bunker.</span>

The moving platform halted at the bottom of the third floor up. There, a ship of similar make and model lay ready on the dock, although the symbol was terribly smudged and faded. It was barely recognizable.~

<strong>Hyloi:</strong>
Hyloi had already finished preparing this ship for his brother, but figured he could just swap. He gestured towards it and spoke eloquently. “You may take this ship inst...” 

Just then, Hyloi noticed another fully-suited crewman shoving tools into a box and walking away from the spacecraft. They bore the stripes of a /RU engineer. He could’ve sworn it didn’t need more maintenance. “Hello! My good friend now retreating from the premises! Mind if you come here for a moment?” he called out.

The crewman froze in place, as if considering whether or not he wanted to bother with the interaction. Reluctantly, he took a few strides towards them.

<strong>Engineer:</strong>
“Yes?” he replied rather cautiously. His voice was squeaky and high-pitched, like a kuaka.

<strong>Hyloi:</strong>
“Would you kindly humour me and explain what you were accomplishing with this vessel?” 

<strong>Engineer:</strong>
“O-oh.” The engineer shifted his tracksuit uncomfortably. “I… had an order to upgrade its firmware to the newest version. Did you… not hear?”

<strong>Hyloi:</strong>
“Oh I see. No problem then, I haven’t had the opportunity to sit for a bit of a read through today’s memos. Carry on,” Hyloi conceded. The crewman scampered off towards the back exit.

“My apologies, where was I?” He continued, turning to Vuko, “So yes, you may have this one at your disposal. It’s a byte lacking in offensive capabilities, but it shall fly just fine. You are aware of how to power it on, yes?”</span>

Vuko noticed that the closest place out of his current position happened to be either Pluto, or an Obelisk battleship. The ship was a lot closer, but was most likely to be fully occupied by Corpus.~

Dr. Deco tore a ‘borrowed’ crewman helmet off his head, exposing the wiry hair behind his quickly receding hairline. The stuff went through for this void-damned corporation had long since robbed him of a youthful head. Not that he ever wished for it to be different, though. He was secretly enjoying himself. 

Other than the voice acting. Void, that was tiring.

“Did the deed?” An attractive voice called out from the door of the store-room Deco retreated to. He grunted.

“Of course. Throw me a bone and I’ll slam Frohd Bek in the nuts with it,” he responded, tossing the helmet at a wall and moving over to a set of lockers. “And I appreciate the femur you lent me, Breeze.”

The well-tanned Doctor Breezy crossed her arms around the datapad in her hand. “Just so long as you know where you get your hits from, hon.”

The corners of her mouth pulled upwards in a bit of a smile. She loved taking part in these ratchet situations. The thrill of danger was irresistible to some. Her smile quickly faltered upon noticing Deco pull a foldable chair out of one of the lockers.

“What.”

Deco was half-way through hauling the object onto the floor when he froze underneath Breezy’s blank stare.

“What?”

“What?!?!” Breezy exclaimed. 

“What,” Deco repeated with a smirk.

“Are you going to tell me the only reason you reserved an entire locker on this side of the ship was to store <em>that</em> thing???”</span>

Breezy stared on with a baffled expression, unsure whether to be surprised or relieved at this point. “M’kay, well I’ll leave you to it then.”

“Actually,” Deco called out, ripping his attention from the chair, “I could do with a cold drink.”

“I don’t hear yooouuuuuuu~~” Breezy sang as she glided out the door, leaving her fellow doctor to his self-declared break hour. She didn’t quite have a direction to walk since half the HQ was under lockdown from containment breaches, but Breezy forged on regardless, a spring in her step. She just about jumped out of her skin when a sudden buzz pressed against her ribs. It was from her datapad.

It was curious that she’d get an email at such a time, but she’d seen stranger. Without much thought, Breezy ran her long fingernails atop the screen until an inbox popped up. Only one email sat unread.

An excitement lifted his spirits as the roar of the thrusters came to life, finally giving him hope of escaping the god-forsaken facility. Who knows what other horrors lurk inside? Who else is experimented on? In light of these thoughts, Vuko checked and memorized both the current coordinates of the ship as well as the vessels callsign, hoping that he will get to blow the void out of it once he recovers.

The initial high of escape didn’t last long, however. The grim of reality started to settle in pretty quickly once Vuko looked at the poor excuse of a leg that the scientists have attached to him. <em>‘All those years of missions, assignments and life-threatening scenarios, and this is how they got me? A bunch of no good corpus scum start dissecting my Ivara while I’m stuck on some shitty island?!’</em> Furious with his current state, he punched the wall nearest him with all the frustration, producing quite a sizeable dent in the interior.

Thinking back on the island brought to mind something very important - Garhul. The poor pup was all alone on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Vuko tried to use transference, but it didn’t seem to be working. That didn’t stop him though, he needed to go back to him, so he kept on trying, and trying... and trying. He was giving it his best for over two hours, but he had to concede eventually. It seemed as if he wasn’t using transference to connect with his warframe, but some form of transcendence activated by the pain that it was enduring.

Now all that was left to do was wait. Wait to reach the destination, grab the gear, and pray to the void that Garhul is okay. Otherwise...</span>

Everything in Vuko’s craft stopped working at once. The engines grinded to a halt, monitor screens flickered on and off before dying, and the light fixtures blinked off with an audible <em>pink</em>. The Ivara was left sitting in the quiet starlight.

Then, out of the left view-port, a massive object flew past, blocking all vision outwards. Its silent approach made possible by the vacuum of space, the craft swiftly spun around to face him while maintaining the same velocity as Vuko’s now dead vessel. 

There, in the dim light, only then did Vuko caught sight of the familiar craft in front of him. It was a yellow and light purple scimitar with white highlights.~</span>

Then, the colorful craft swung by the front window, causing Vuko’s non-existent eyes to widen as he loudly exclaimed, almost shouting. “fatherMUCKER!” With an invisible grin the size of his face, he excitedly waited for the laser to finish its work, and without much of a hesitation, he jumped straight into the deployer.</span>

Vuko was shrouded in darkness for a couple seconds before emerging into the cool atmosphere of a landing craft. He immediately saw a jungle of disconnected cables and wires dangling from the ceiling above, as if trying to snatch him up.~

“And so we fall, Vuko,” a recognizable voice weakly broke through the lulling Scimitar’s hums, “back to before we started.”

An operator in a black and yellow manduka suit sat slouched with his back to the craft’s stowed docking ramp, regarding the Ivara with a pained grin plastered on the side of his mouth. With a slow and deliberate movement, he pushed himself up to sit straighter, all the while clutching his chest with one arm.

“Shattered, but at least not snuffed.”</span>

Once the deployer has fully rotated, he jumped out of it with excitement, only to slow down once again after spotting the black &amp; yellow Tenno sitting somberly. He pushed a couple cables out of his way as he stepped to kneel before him, the bare prosthetic in full view. 

“You have no idea.” He commented, reassuring the truth behind Dis’ statement, and went in for a bear hug, wrapping his friend tightly.</span>

Disruptis meekly accepted the hug with a quivering smile. It only lasted a couple seconds before he let out a sharp cry of pain and pushed his good friend away. Now close-up, Vuko could see the broad scar clawing its way up onto Disruptis’s right cheek from somewhere below his neck. That was new.

“Sor..ry,” Disruptis panted, “I’m not… doing too hot right now. Too many nights hitting club--”

He jerked a gloved fist up to his mouth and spewed three very nasty coughs into it. Despite his evident pain, the Tenno’s tear-stained eyes communicated an expression of joy and relief. “But… thank you, Vuko, for staying alive,” he somberly concluded. 

Disruptis shot a glance past him and raised his raspy voice. “Go, Coal. Take us back.”

Past the mess of electrical vines cluttering the interior of the Scimitar where the circular pedestal one typically knelt on when interacting with the navigation module was found, was instead a yawning hole. A lean, indiscriminate mound of black goop slowly dripped viscous liquid darkness into the cavity, which it seemed to be seated in. Somehow fixed to the top of it was a broad, white colombina mask that stood resistant to the blob’s on staining. It peered at the two with haunting, eyeless sockets.

And then it moved.

Or turned, to be more specific. It acted on its own, rotating to face the windowsill with a blank expression. Small tendrils raised themselves up like tiny little hairs all over its sides, and the entire cockpit window lit up with a holographic display. Dozens of diagrams, figures, and numbers popped to life along the glass as the ship rumbled forward.</span>

Disruptis’ push met little resistance as Vuko let go shortly after he heard his friend squeal, reminding himself that he was in a war machine, squeezing his very much fleshy companion.

“You’re off the hook... for now. But you’re gonna have to tell me all about this.” He gestured towards the massive damage. “You’ve been gone way too long not to have some story behind it.” Vuko cheerfully responded, happy to have his friend back.

As Disruptis spoke, Vuko turned to faces towards the front of the craft to see what’s happening. “Coal? You got yourself a new cephalooOOOOH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT THING?!” He reached autonomously for his hip to take out a sidearm, only to realize that nothing is there. Panicked, he took a few steps back, trying to hide behind the Tenno and use him as a shield.</span>

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis cracked a smile. The reactions never got old. “Oh man, it gets a lot weirder than this, Vuk. I showed some of this stuff to Mataeru and he didn’t feel it was a good idea to use it, so most of you guys have never seen some of the crazy things I keep under lock. But now… now is different. Now, I’m going to need your help with these things...”

While finishing his sentence, Disruptis swung his head around to where the sound of a sword clattering came from. Finding the object now on the ground, he quickly jerked upright. “Whoa hey Vuko! Can you put that back for me gently please? I’ve been holding on to it for a friend since the Orokin and I’ll be mucked if I damage it now.”</span>

Before he could get a sentence however, Disruptis mentioned the sword. “Oh, sure.... wait, is this thing both Sentient and Orokin?” Vuko asked with a puzzled voice as he gently put it back to it’s place. “Nevermind.” He quickly corrected himself. “You’ve got my full support with whatever you need, but for now we need to head to Earth as quick as possible.

Disruptis gave Vuko a respectful nod, then forced himself to his feet. Staggering like a zombie just out of bed, the yellow Tenno approached the ship’s viewport in thought. He stared off into the beautiful, familiar, infinite depths of space. His piercing, reverent stare seemed capable of catching a glimpse of the center of the universe itself.

Then still clutching his rib, he donned his characteristic, invincible grin.

“Y’know Vuko, a year is a long time to spend dead, don’t you agree?” Disruptis opined, “and I don’t know about you but I’m getting pretty mucking antsy.”

“So,” he cast a backwards glance right in the Ivara’s neuroptics, as the Scimitar roared forwards, as the space stretched onwards, and as a gleam of hope finally sparkled on the horizon.

“Are you ready to start over again?”

“And then after that you… went on break?”

“Well yes,” Deco replied, leaning back in the reclining chair he had brought to the small cubicle, “I finished what you would’ve wanted me to do, right Blue?”

A bulky Corpus man dressed in an indigo formal suit crammed the rest of the tiny office’s space, right across a desk from the doctor. “‘Bout time you started making my load lighter. Managing CDF ain’t easy when there’s a new lab phasing out of existence every time I turn around.”

Blue shifted his head from a report in his hands to Deco, many tattoos robbing his face of contour. The Executive always bore a very solemn expression.  

“We’ve got something new for you,” he announced, changing tone and grabbing hold of a manilla envelope. “I’m not the one who’d usually hand this to you, but Red’s doing classified things right now so he’s not available.” Deco gingerly relieved Blue of the envelope and slid its contents onto his lap. They were mostly pictures. Pictures of an old buddy of his.

“You remember Stick, right?” 

Deco’s heart dropped right down into his gut. He knew where this was going. “We’re… pulling him out early? Why?”

“Point of incidence with the COE.”

“What? What could we possibly get from trading Stick?”</span>

“A couple schematics, doctor. Tech’s going to make some modifications to an Ivara-type warframe for the Head’s friend you just reeled in.”

Deco let out a long, undulating sigh. “I’m gonna need to get him real drunk for this.”

Blue shuffled some papers. “One last thing, doctor. I’m very curious about the method you used to trap the Target-HA.”

“Well… I figured that if I catch him with the kinetic siphons and wait for him to transfer, then I’d be able to use the nullifiers to trap him outside of his warframe.”

Blue raised a hand to halt him. “Oh no no, I understand all that perfectly. I'm just curious: was it really necessary to use confetti instead of standard reflective plastic?”

“Not really, no.”</span>
