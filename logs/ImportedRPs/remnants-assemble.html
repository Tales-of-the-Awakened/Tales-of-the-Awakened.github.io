            point:<br></span><span class="c2">&quot; </span><span class="c2">@Active</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;
            Tenno, the time for our team building is here. meet me outside Sanctuary if you wish to train with me in
            preparation of our assault on the Orokin Tower.<br>-Mataeru&quot;</span><span class="c7 c8"><br><br>Those
            that respond would see his Ash Prime is standing motionless outside the open Sanctuary exit while he himself
            is standing facing down the hallway, Commodore Prime suit polished with it&#39;s hood closed, hands clasped
            behind his back~</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.lszc7qpp4txr"><span class="c0">Muro</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9">Muro:<br>~Mere minutes after the announcement had been broadcast, &nbsp;the sound of
            heavy footsteps could be heard slowly thudding through the lounge and down the entrance hallway. Within a
            few moments, the cause of the sound came into view: a Hydroid warframe, heavily armed with a Zarr over his
            right shoulder, twin Gratakas hanging from his waist, and his trademark Fragor Prime holstered on his lower
            back. He moved with purpose, but at the same time it was clear he wasn&#39;t in a
            hurry.~<br><br></span><span class="c2">Muro briefly looked about the entrance at the end of the hall, mildly
            surprised that no one else had arrived yet. &nbsp;True, years of working for Ballas had drilled into him the
            art of being ready at a moment&#39;s notice, but among the Veiled Tenno he wasn&#39;t known as the most
            punctual of the lot. Reaching the end of the hallway, he gave Mata a &nbsp;wave.</span><span
            class="c9"><br><br>&quot;Mornin&#39; Boss!&quot; </span><span class="c2">he began, bowing
            slightly,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&quot; Glad to see you&#39;re coming with this time. Can&#39;t
            remember the last time we did a mission together, so I&#39;m curious if you&#39;re as scary as I
            remember.&quot; </span><span class="c7 c2">he spoke lightly, teasing him with the last sentence. Not wanting
            to take up too much space, Muro walked to one the walls and leaned against it, waiting for more people to
            show up.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c5" id="h.mx5v5ztk5hah"><span class="c0">Disruptis</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9">~The barracks weren&rsquo;t the particularly most comfortable place to sleep in. Any
            Tenno could argue that better accommodations could be found in any of their orbiters, but that was only to
            the picky. The darkened quarters were blanketed in a thick sheet of silence at the moment. None of the beds
            were occupied, but that didn&rsquo;t mean the room was empty. A Tenno had collapsed on the floor and was
            experiencing the greatest sense of tranquility he had felt in a long time. He had lain down in the recovery
            position with a small stream of drool escaping his open mouth. The teen was fast asleep, sinking into the
            depths of his release from fatigue. Unfortunately, it would not last much longer.~<br><br></span><span
            class="c0">XerAI:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">A soothing hum crescendoed through the
            Tenno&rsquo;s communications as XerAI initiated a transmission. She was here to wake her sleepy operator
            up.</span><span class="c9"><br><br></span><span class="c2 c12">BEEEEEP BEEEEP
            BEEEEEEEEEEPPP!!!!!!!!!!!</span><span class="c9"><br><br></span><span class="c0">Disruptis:</span><span
            class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Disruptis jerked upwards, attempting to assume a combat stance but
            ending up smashing his head against the panel he was sleeping under.</span><span
            class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;What the MUCK!?!?!? Are we dying?!&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he
            yelled.</span><span class="c9"><br><br></span><span class="c0">XerAI:</span><span class="c9"><br>&ldquo;Oh
            sorry, that was the last sound sample you gave me for an alarm. (&#12539;&#12408;&#12539;)&rdquo;
        </span><span class="c7 c2">the cephalon responded.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Disruptis:</span><span class="c9"><br>&ldquo;Ah, I guess that&rsquo;s my fault then,
            whoops.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Disruptis rubbed the back of his head and stood up, revealing his
            work. His equipment was now properly installed in the building, and quite unobtrusively too. New circuits
            lay in small portions on the walls in appealing, straight lines. They would allow the sanctuary to
            communicate with o&rsquo;twelve in case of an emergency. It had always been picky about its
            services.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;<br><br>&ldquo;Wait a second, why in the Void did I ever use
            something like that as an alarm anyway?&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he questioned, wiping the drool off
            his cheek.</span><span class="c9"><br><br></span><span class="c0">XerAI:</span><span
            class="c9"><br>&ldquo;By the way, Mataeru is waiting for you at the entrance. -&#8255;-&rdquo; the cephalon
            reminded him.<br><br></span><span class="c0">Disruptis:</span><span class="c9"><br>&ldquo;OH, that&rsquo;s
            right!&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">the operator exclaimed. He quickly summoned his warframe and hurried
            out the exit of the barracks. The Limbo sped-walk through the halls, eventually coming up on Muro and
            Mataeru. Upon arriving, he felt over his frame for his weapons. They were all in place and ready to finally
            see some action.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Ey, ey, ey! Told ya I&rsquo;d be here on time for the
            next one,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he greeted the two.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c9">Isa:<br></span><span class="c2">Isa was in the foundry, quietly watching it work on
            the MOAs Mataeru had requested her to build when she receive the message. She immediately transferred into
            her Saryn and strode towards the exit, her Argonak in its hands already. She rolled her left shoulder as she
            approached the exit. She stopped a few feet short of Mataeru and looked down at him through the
            warframe.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&quot;Weapons are currently modified for combat against the Corpus.
            Shall we find one my size for the mission?&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2">She said, attempting to
            supply a bit of dry humor towards Mataeru&#39;s plan to her infiltrating them.</span><span
            class="c7 c8"><br><br>&quot;A well placed shot to the head should leave enough of the uniform undamaged that
            it could be easily repaired.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.nt0go1gm6txv"><span class="c0">Vuko</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9">Vuko:<br> </span><span class="c2">Being late for a mission, briefing, or even a
            training session is not something that Vuko does. He usually is the first one to show up, as the
            militaristic routine has been drilled into him during all those years served under Ballas. &rsquo;There is
            no way I&rsquo;m going to make it on time.&rsquo; He thinks to himself as he makes his way across another
            ravine by leaping from one of the edges to the other and slamming his Kamas into the rocky wall to catch
            himself. As he lift himself over the ledge, and stands on top he sees a big part of the broken Lua, and
            below him, no more than a hundred meters away is the entrance to the Sanctuary. Vuko notices that except
            Mata there are 3 more people present, including a familiar face - Muro. &lsquo;Huh. Maybe I won&rsquo;t be
            that late after all.&rsquo; He tells himself, as Artemis appears in his hand. He takes an arrow out of the
            quiver on his arm, takes the characteristic archer stance, right foot forward, right hand with the bow in
            front and pulls the bowstring. With a &lsquo;THWISH&rsquo; the arrow is released and quickly hits the wall
            above the entrance forming a zip line between the two places. Without any hesitation Vuko takes out a single
            Kama and jumps down, hooking himself on the zip line with the weapon. He slides down, hanging on the Kama,
            and at the very end of the ride the line disappears, allowing him for a graceful landing.</span><span
            class="c9">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Hey Boss, hope I didn&rsquo;t take too long.&rdquo; - </span><span
            class="c7 c2">He says as he took his place next to Muro.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c5" id="h.izq71oqz7lto"><span class="c0">Devros von Inie</span><span class="c9"><br>&ldquo;Ah aye, jist a
            wee more an&#39; &#39;e&rsquo;ll be ready ter ayte!&rdquo;<br><br></span><span class="c2">Proclaimed Devros
            in a lot of excitement as he stood above one of the caged Kuaka onboard his orbiter with a bag of feed in
            one hand. He was making the usual round of the animals, giving them food and keeping a eye on their
            gains&hellip;meanwhile the familiar tip tap of hoofs resonating behind him with each step, a shadow
            constantly over him in his flowery ship. Reaching the final animal, a caged Condor right next to the
            Navigator, he crouches down and looks at the bird, probably thinking of how to eat it while the presence
            stares at him, almost throwing daggers.<br><br>Letting out a sigh he looks over his shoulder at his stalker.
            Standing with his arms crossed over his chest is a Feyarch Oberon with a Oberon Prime helmet. The armor part
            of him is colored in cloud white, while the more fleshy &ldquo;plant&rdquo; part of him is in algae green,
            finally his drape is painted with crimson red, like that of a withering rose. The Oberon, although eyeless,
            appears to be glaring down at the boy in a displeased manner. Devros chuckles and throws his arms in the air
            in surrender as he straightens up</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Gran&#39; so, a dayle is a dayle, oi
            tuk wan a week ago so yer filled yisser quota..&rdquo;<br><br></span><span class="c2">The Oberon seemed
            pleased by the response and relaxed his posture, turning around to head towards the fish tanks. Devros
            shakes his head at his warframe thinking about who is the actual master onboard.<br><br>Then a bright
            flashing light lit up on his Navigator and the boy whipped his head towards it, wrinkling his brows.
            &ldquo;Man&hellip;I really shud fix me cephalon&hellip;&rdquo;He thought as he flipped on the Navigator and
            it displayed a message just on top of a blinking point on Lua, the place of the transmission.</span><span
            class="c7 c8">&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh? Team building!&rdquo;</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He twirled on his heels and slid down the ramp</span><span
            class="c9">&nbsp;&ldquo;Garhul! Git up yer lug! Trainin&#39; day!&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">He yelled
            out as he passed the Incubator, causing a sleeping behemoth to wiggle back from a bomb nap. Devros dashed
            towards his personal quarters where he undresses from his casual clothes and puts on his Verida suit,
            without the hood.<br><br>A few moments later, Devros in his Oberon and Garhul land, via Scimitar drop, a few
            meters away from the gathering. Devros gives his gear a check &ldquo;Venka prime here, Good ol&rsquo; Lenzy,
            and the boom brick&rdquo; Nodding his head, he walks up to the meeting with the kubrow trailing close
            behind.<br><br>Upon arrival, Devros will throw anyone that looks his way a nod and a wave of his hand but
            otherwise says nothing as he takes a seat on top of some nearby rocks. Garhul sits beside his legs and
            nudges them. Devros smiles and starts petting his kubrows head as they wait for further instructions.</span>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">A familiar looking, dented Liset flew overhead, dropping
            down Kapak&#39;s all too enigmatic Nidus, the dust covered ground being flung outwards ad he landed on one
            knee.</span><span class="c9"><br>&quot;Apologies, thought I&#39;d drop in dramatically, as if we were doing
            a </span><span class="c2">real</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;mission.&quot; </span><span class="c2">He stood

            hat to the Tenno and his dog before turning to the others.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&quot;Isa. Vuko, my

            again and an Octavia stepped through, his resonator following closely behind as the source of the symphony.
            As the sound dissipated, Cev&rsquo;s neuroptics scanned over the group.</span><span

            joining me here. This exercise was designed to help us get at least some familiarity with each other&#39;s
            combat prowess. We will be separating into groups of four and moving to different parts of the ruins in this
            area. Several of my security systems have detected several squads of Grineer and Corpus soldiers within our

            Garhul looks over too and his stubby little tail starts wagging at the sight of food, but stays put while
            his dull yellow eyes follow the cheese like a hawk gazing at prey. Devros shakes his head at his companion
            and playfully covers the kubrows eyes with his hand, only for him to dip his head to the side to lock on to
            the cheese again. Devros covers Garhul&rsquo;s eyes again but he tilts his head to the side again. This
            little antic goes about till Devros hears his name being mentioned and he quickly whipped up to look at

            they approached, or at least the ones who spoke to him. He offered a friendly wave to Disruptis and Kapak,

            class="c9"><br>&quot;Disruptis, Kapak, and Vuko, you will team up with Muro. Disruptis, I will have to act
            as squad captain. However, if you do not want to lead the squad, you may pass it off to Muro or
            Kapak.&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2">He then turns to Isa and Devros</span><span

            put with people he knew and could stand. The only one he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with was the Veiled Tenno
            Muro, but he seemed to be pretty close with Vuko, so that was fine.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Cev:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Cev stood in silence for a
            moment, lost in thought as his finger tapped rhythmically against his opposite shoulder.</span><span
            class="c9"><br>&ldquo;I mean, sure mate. I just thought you may want to lead because, well, you&rsquo;re the
            boss after all.&rdquo;<br></span><span class="c2">He pushed off the wall and moved closer to Isa and Devros,
            bouncing on the balls off his feet in time to the music he had playing in his ear. He clasped his hands
            behind his head as he spoke with a child-like excitement in his voice.</span><span

            standing with his back straight and one hand on the rim of his Limbo&rsquo;s built in &lsquo;hat&rsquo;. He
            gave Mataeru a deep and flourishing bow.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&ldquo;Why yes sir, I do believe I
            shall accept that responsibility then.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he replied in a dandy accent. The
            Tenno hadn&rsquo;t gotten the chance to see Vuko or Muro in action, but felt they would had some great
            tricks to show. The picturing of a million ways to creatively use Vuko&rsquo;s wire-arrows already got him
            excited. He sauntered over to Kapak and received his high-five, motioning for Muro and Vuko to come
            closer.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s most likely going to just
            be a free-for-all anyway, so you won&rsquo;t have to follow any orders,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he
            whispered near the Nidus&rsquo;s audio receptors,</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure
            we can all handle ourselves in these situations.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Isa:</span><span class="c9"><br>&quot;Yes... tricks. I don&#39;t have the equipment
            do perform the sort of tricks I prefer. I doubt Mataeru would appreciate controlled demolitions so close to
            the base.&quot; <br></span><span class="c2">She said looking down at her Argonak.</span><span
            class="c7 c8">&nbsp;<br>&quot;My primary &#39;trick&#39; when I&#39;m unable to utilize demolition is to
            place spores on the enemy, then shoot them until they stop moving, then put one more bullet in their head
            for good measure. I just hope you don&#39;t intend to rely too much on stealth. Sneaking is... not my strong
            suit.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Devros von Inie</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">The flora
            patterned Oberon Prime nods his head and hops off the rock to meet his designated group half way with his
            companion trailing close behind. Devros will let out a loud cackle and aim to playfully slap the Saryn on
            the shoulder as a form of greeting</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Aye, I feel ya, I&rsquo;m more of a
            party crasher meself, stealthing aboyt is dull. I like to spread panic and give &lsquo;em a fighting
            chance&rdquo;<br><br></span><span class="c2">He points with his thumb over his shoulder to his polished
            Lenz. Of course, the Lenz is not really a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; weapon but Devros likes the pocket explosives
            and it feels empowering to shoot that in a cluster of them or just to flush them out from cover. Tilting his
            head towards the bouncing Octavia, he nods his head and says in his rusty voice</span><span
            class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Disrupt, distract and crash, those are me tricks...if all else fails den just let
            de kubrow out!&rdquo;<br><br></span><span class="c2">He chuckles and will throw Cev a fist bump as a
            greeting.<br><br>Garhul remains close to Devros, throwing looks at the unfamiliar &ldquo;faces&rdquo; but
            doesn&rsquo;t make a move for anything just yet.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vuko:</span><span class="c9"><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">He stands in a
            stoic manner, emotionally distanced from everyone, similar to Mataeru. However the root of his behavior
            seems to stem not from the need to exert domanince and leadership, but from a personal need of solitude.
            Vuko responds to Devros&rsquo; nod in a formal fashion with a sharp and mechanical nod.</span><span
            class="c9"><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">However, as Mataeru announces the squad he lightens and
            looseness up. Being assigned with both Muro, who is basically his younger brother, despite them not being
            related, and Kapak, who he bonded with since he woke up, put him in a good mood. Vuko gave Kapak a high
            five, despite the fact he had to jump up to reach his hand, which looked almost comically, as the difference
            between the towering Nidus, and the short Ivara is quite drastic.</span><span class="c9"><br> &nbsp;
            &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Overhearing what the Limbo said, he added in a tone low enough for no one
            other that the freshly assembled squad to hear.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;- &ldquo;I appreciate that you
            are giving us a lot of leeway in our combat, but I think it would be beneficial for you to get used to
            commanding us. Muro and me have been trained over many years to fight in tandem. You need to learn how to
            use that efficiently.&rdquo; - </span><span class="c2">He explained in the robotic, scrambled
            voice.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;- &ldquo;To add to that I have quite a few tricks up my sleeve.&rdquo; -
        </span><span class="c7 c2">He added, this time one could notice a hint of excitement about the use of his
            quiver, at which he pointed with his head.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Muro:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Muro nodded along with
            Mata&#39;s speech, listening carefully as he assigned teams. He visibly perked up when he and Vuko were
            assigned the same team, and went over to join the other three members of his squad, enthusiastically
            returning Kapak&#39;s high-five. Upon hearing Disruptis&#39; plan, however, he became confused. He had never
            had a leader who wasn&#39;t giving orders before, so that took a moment to process. Besides, wasn&#39;t the
            whole point of this exercise to learn how to work as a team? &nbsp;Muro was about to voice his concern, but
            Vuko beat him to it.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&quot;Vuko has a point,&quot; </span><span class="c2">He
            whispered,</span><span class="c7 c8">&nbsp;&quot; I&#39;m sure each of us could do this alone if we really
            had to, but we need to have each other&#39;s backs here. &quot;</span></p>

            hearing the annoucement, and transferred into his Rhino. He had decided to give the helmet on his shoulder a
            bit more of colorful pigments - a mix of drawn flowers on it. Oro&#39;Kino made his way with his selection
            of weapons - his Jat Kitaag and his lenz. He was one of t he last to make it, waving as he walked towards

            opportunity to call the shots for an operation. If you do not wish to lead that is

            class="c9"><br>&quot;Ah, Kino, I was beginning to think you were not going to make appearance like the rest
            of our brethren.&quot;<br><br></span><span class="c2">He looks at the two currently formed
            squads</span><span class="c9"><br>&quot;We need to rearrange our numbers...&quot;<br></span><span
            class="c2">He pauses eyeing the current group composition before slowly pointing to Cev and then to
            Vuko</span><span class="c9"><br>&quot;Cev, you will take command of a third squad. Vuko, you will join Cev
            and Orokino. That should spread our balance of power relatively evenly.&quot;<br></span><span class="c2">He
            stops once more, looking at each group before him one last time for a power balance analysis before
            nodding</span><span class="c7 c8"><br>&quot;Any questions?&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Disruptis:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Truth be told,
            Disruptis possessed quite excellent leadership skills. (There was a reason behind his Naramon focus.) His
            most recent failures merely clamped a damper onto his self-confidence. Fortunately, the voices of his fellow
            Tenno were re-assuring him once again, if just a little.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Alright well,
            in that case I&rsquo;ve got some great ideas if you&rsquo;re willing to listen.&rdquo; </span><span
            class="c2">he stated in slowly growing excitement.</span><span class="c9"><br><br></span><span
            class="c2">His posture sank a little as he grew disappointed at the thought of Vuko&rsquo;s transfer. He
            didn&rsquo;t feel too bad however, the Ivara would be in more than capable hands. His old friend Cev was no
            pushover when it came to strategy, and might even work better than Disruptis could. When it came to a good
            plan, the Octavia easily won the race between the two of them on a good day. He would only place second next
            to Disruptis&rsquo;s incredible proficiency in winging any given situation.</span><span
            class="c9"><br><br>&ldquo;Guts,&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">he cursed. The Limbo still expressed some
            concern over the composition of Cev&rsquo;s team, but didn&rsquo;t voice his worries. An Ivara, Octavia, and
            Rhino weren&rsquo;t necessarily the easiest things to play around with. The Tenno would have his work cut
            out for him.</span></p>

    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Muro:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Muro marveled at the oddly
            decorated Rhino that now stood before them. Were the flowers supposed to intimidate enemies? He doubted it,
            but who knew what scared Grineer these days? Admittedly, he wasn&#39;t initially paying attention as Mata
            was talking, but his head snapped towards Mata when he announced Vuko&#39;s transfer.</span><span
            class="c9">&nbsp;<br>&quot;Aw, seriously Boss?&quot; </span><span class="c2">He said disappointedly, his
            arms spread wide as if to demonstrate shock. A quick look at Mata&#39;s face made Muro reel in his emotions.
            Even with his hood up, he knew the face Mata was making. &nbsp;Questioning the leader was never a wise
            choice. He sighed resignedly, dropping his arms to his sides</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&quot;Oh,
            alright.&quot; </span><span class="c7 c2">Muro had really wanted to fight alongside Vuko again after all
            this time, but he had a feeling he&#39;d get his chance. &nbsp;&#39;Besides&#39;, he thought, looking at his
            remaining squad mates, &#39;these two look like they&#39;re pretty interesting too.&#39;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Disruptis:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">The Limbo brought up
            the augmented reality within his neuroptics with a focused thought. With a few swipes, he navigated to his
            messages and added the location coordinates to a waypoint on his warframe&rsquo;s HUD.</span><span

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Isa:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c7 c2">Isa remains silent as the
            others head out. She follows a short distance behind Mataeru, Argonak still at the ready, Taxon hovering
            about her head.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c14 c0">Kapak:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c7 c2">The Nidus coughed
            and sulked away behind the Limbo, stealing one last glance at Vuko.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oro&#39;Kino:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Oro&#39;Kino bowed
            his head to Mata, both in greeting and in goodbye. Once he was told of his squad he straightened his
            posture, taking hammer in hand. It was his weapon of choice after all. The Rhino hadn&#39;t fought much but
            small pockets of Grineer that dared to approach the Sanctuary - hence his latest art projects. The Rhino
            approached Cev, coming quite close to him, almost uncomfortably so. Oro&#39;Kino was a natural follower, and
            as always, obedient to the words of his peers. He loomed his head next to Cev&#39;s, as if awaiting
            command.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Cev:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">He watched the other teams
            begin to leave as the rhino approached him. Taking a few steps back he tilted his head to the side as he
            looked the oddly painted rhino over. Cev pressed his fingers together nervously, his gaze darting back and
            forth between Vuko and Oro&rsquo;Kino.</span><span class="c9"><br>&ldquo;Well this will be an interesting
            set to fight with&hellip;&rdquo; <br></span><span class="c2">he stated, trailing off as he lost himself in
            thought. When he finally snapped back he looked to the rhino next to him.</span><span
            class="c7 c8"><br>&ldquo;Okay, you take the lead since you&rsquo;re our shield. Make sure no one touches me
            &lsquo;n Vuko. Vuko, you stay near the back and pick them off. With that, let&#39;s get rolling
            mates.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oro&#39;Kino:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Oro&#39;Kino only
            scooted closer when Cev stepped away. Listening intently, the Rhino nods in understanding and backs away
            once knowing his objective. Looking towards the other teams and the way they went, he stepped forward and
            clenched a fist. Swinging it up in the air then pulling it back down, his Warframe&#39;s outermost layer is
            coated in golden moving layers of energy. The several odd paintings on Oro&#39;Kino&#39;s warframe shined in
            the radiance, wonderfully highlighting their colors and making their edges much more bold. Hammer in hand,
            he looked back to Cev and questioned,</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2 c10">&quot;WHERE.
            GO?&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Muro:</span><span class="c9"><br></span><span class="c2">Muro pulled his Zarr off his
            shoulder, cracking his neck in the same fluid motion. Giving a low chuckle at Disruptis&#39; clever naming,
            &nbsp;he strode after the Limbo, cradling his weapon in his hands. He spoke with enthusiasm, delighted to be
            going on a proper mission after all this time.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&quot;Aye aye, sir, lead
            on.&quot; <br><br></span><span class="c7 c2">As he walked away from the other groups, Muro looked over his
            shoulder and gave a regretful wave to Vuko. &#39;Maybe next time&#39;, he thought.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vuko:</span><span class="c9"><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">He
            approached his squad without saying a single word, or even making a single sound, and only nodded in
            agreement to Cev&rsquo;s orders. As if to show his readiness, he took a polished and well taken care of
            Vectis off his capeless back.</span></p>

            hollered over transmission as he penguin-dived off the last cliff near Sanctuary. The Limbo hit the ground
            in a hard slide. The momentum of his fall plus the special anti-friction provided by his modifications
            carried him the rest of the way to the base entrance. His slide slowed down to a crawl and finally stopped
            before the door. Disruptis got up and lifted his arms above his head, locking his fingers behind his
            neck.</span><span class="c7 c8"><br><br>&quot;AH. That was pretty refreshing, I&#39;m not gonna lie. I even
            managed to save a crude simulacrum replay for later.&quot;</span></p>

            Disruptis a few moments later, moving at a moderately paced jog. He wasn&#39;t in any major rush to get back
            to the Sanctuary, as he was still enjoying the nostalgic rush of combat, in addition to his sudden windfall
            of platinum.</span><span class="c9"><br><br>&quot;A replay?&quot; </span><span class="c2">Muro asked,
            jokingly.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&quot;Of what? the fight was over in less than a minute.&quot;
        </span><span class="c2">He laughed for a moment.</span><span class="c7 c8">&nbsp;&quot;Its a shame they
            can&#39;t all be that simple.&quot;</span></p>

            class="c7 c8"><br>&quot;Good to hear your mission was a success. We destroyed both squads and managed to
            procure a suit for Isa that looks like it will fit. That being said, we will be able to begin the first
            steps of our mission to commandeer an Orokin tower shortly. Well done Tenno.&quot;</span></p>
