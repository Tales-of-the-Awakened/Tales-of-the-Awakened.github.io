            lancer&rsquo;s weapon away and slicing his hands a little in the process (1 AP). Disruptis landed a forceful
            kick to the grineer&rsquo;s gut, knocking the wind out of him and sending him flying into the fourth lancer
            behind him. At the same time, he canceled his new projectile&rsquo;s access to the rift, bringing the
            grineer back into the material plane. (1 AP) Fastening his grip on his deadly pole-arm, the Tenno swung
            again. This time he swept the feet of the third lancer up into the air, bringing himself into the material
            plane just as the pole connected. (1 AP) Using the momentum of that same swing while his enemy fell,
            Disruptis brought his blood-stained upper blade around and straight down onto his unfortunate
            opponent&rsquo;s neck. The graceful maneuver was accomplished within a second. (1 AP) <br><br>Not wasting

            other plane. (1 AP) He took a moment to glance over and see what his companions were up to, and was not
            disappointed to see a vile mass of tentacles bundling together some grineer sushi as artificial rain
            cascaded down in beautiful sheets of water. He lingered on the sight with a slight longing, for one of the
            things he enjoyed most was sitting under the pressure of a good storm. (1 AP) As he watched, Disruptis
            snapped his fingers unnecessarily while causing the trapped grineer to surge with rift energy. Extra layers
            of purple light surrounded them as the bottled energy enveloped their bodies, brimming with power. [[Rift

            had handled himself masterfully as well, his attacks seeming like a well choregraphed dance in comparison to
            his and Kapak&#39;s heavy-handed assault. It was only then that Muro noticed the Grineer soldier Disruptis

            Fragor on his free shoulder, eying both potential targets. In terms of raw distance, the cliff was farther,
            but archway would technically be a more impressive shot. He turned and nodded to Kapak.</span><span
            class="c1">&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;Alright Kapak, you&#39;re on!&quot; </span><span class="c6 c1">Muro walked
            around to the opposite side of the frozen Grineer, so that its eyes, still wide with fear, faced his
            executioner. Muro stood about eight feet away from the Grineer, easing his &nbsp;hammer off his shoulder
            into both of his hands. Shifting his grip to maximize the torque of his swing, he began to stride up to the
            Grineer, raising his hammer and rotating his torso in preparation. Making eye contact with the Grineer, he
            offered his condolences.</span><span class="c1"><br><br>&quot;Sorry pal, but this is really gonna hurt.
            &quot; </span><span class="c9 c6 c1">His voice was mirthful, yet malicious. There was not a hint of genuine
            remorse. As he got within proper strike range, he swung his Fragor as hard as he could, bringing his hammer
            low and arcing upward. A single finger snap could be heard, a fraction of second before the hammer
            connected. The head of the hammer hit just below the chest plate of the Grineer, causing the armor to
            crumple inward as the force of the blow began to lift the soldier off the ground. The swing was finished as
            Muro completed his stride, launching his hapless target at the high arch.</span></p>

            the wind from the hapless Grineer, who was now well past half dead and sailing through the air. His death
            would be mercifully quick, as Muro&#39;a aim was a tad low. Rather than hitting the the archway squarely,
            &nbsp;the grineer flew just high enough for the back of his head to slam into the arch, killing him
            instantly and causing a satisfying, gong-like tone to ring forth from the metallic structure. Muro rested
            his Fragor upon his shoulder once again, nodding in approval. He leaned back, looking towards
            Kapak.</span><span class="c4 c1"><br><br>&quot;And that sound, my friend, means you owe me some
