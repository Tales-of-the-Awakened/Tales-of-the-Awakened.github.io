        will have a chain of actions as follows So far the order is as follows:
        - Zereth - Vuko - Kapak - Donatra - Lekalis - Muro -and last me) ~The
        market city of Cetus was bustling as always, the sounds of the Ostron
        traders calling out about their wares and spices saying it was the best
        in the system. Having become a major hub for the Tenno, one could see
        the tall, Tenno controlled frames strolling head and shoulders above the
        townspeople as they bought Zaw weapons, or traded fish and precious
        gemstones collected in the dangerous Plains.~(edited)</span

        Inari sat on the ledge letting the warmth of the afternoon sun kiss her
        pale skin, in her lap was a handful of loose papers made from dried
        Kubrow skins. Each sheet of parchment had different hand drawn images of
        the town, and a few having the portraits of some of the Stall owners
        that she had come to know and befriend. The young child Nakak had
        introduced the elder Tenno to the ideas of drawing by showing off some
        of his personal drawings he did of the warframes and their star child
        counterparts. This had lit a spark of curiosity within Inari and she had
        traded him some bits of charcoal and paper from the young child for some
        underwater coral she had picked up from Uranus.</span

        bellows of the giant cloth roof of the market place that kept the Ostrom
        cool from the afternoon sun, Inari looked down in her lap at the
        charcoal drawing of the border wall that led out into the plains,
        tilting her head she shaded a section of a wall and held it up gently
        blowing some of the excess off. She turned to the inside of the building
        looking at a figure that was taller than her with a little more curves,
        holding up the papyrus to her trickster frame Mirage, &quot;What ya
        think Ami, does it look better this time?&quot; The frame neither
        responded or made any movement to reply to her as it simply stood in the
        shadows of the large empty space, gently breathing. Inari sighed heavily
        crumbling up the papyrus paper tossing it to the floor with a small
        collection that had been building for the past hour</span

        as he strode through Cetus&rsquo; bustling marketplace. He deftly
        slipped between patrons, talking to vendors, rarely staying at one stall
        for long. Every time he stepped between the sunlight and the shadows of
        the canopies, he would glint in the light, forgoing any chance if
        stealth in exchange for his looks. He continued his determined browse
        through the marketplace, clearly on the lookout for something specific,

        attention as the magnification of the light through her oculus lenses,
        it wasn&#39;t bothersome at first, however each continuous flash became
        such a distraction she couldn&#39;t draw, &quot;honestly who is it that

        on the ledge, the Tenno shifted so her feet hung off the side and her
        eyes scanned across the crowd of Ostrom and frames to find the green
        culprit, responsible for ruining her peaceful afternoon.</span

        full of colorful powders while the vendor advertised his wares.
        &ldquo;-Display your love with a streak of vermillion! Highlight your

        stood over at the Old man Suumbat&#39;s gem store, she always tried to
        meet any new faces that passed through town especially those of any
        fellow Tenno, and the flashy green Volt was very much a new sight to
        her. Leaving her art supplies slightly scattered around the window,
        Inari walked over to the silent placing her hands on the cool steel
        flesh of her sister, &quot;well Ami let&#39;s go see meet some new
        siblings&quot;. The tenno&#39;s body loses it&#39;s opacity as Inari
        merges in with Ami-no-uzume, till only the sleek Mirage is the only
        person left on the platform. Rolling her shoulders and stretching out
        her tight sinew structure, Inari and Ami head over to the opening deftly
        hoping over the side with one hand and sliding down the side of the rock
        wall kicking up some dust as they head towards the market street.</span

        before speaking. &ldquo;Hello. I was originally just browsing

        hands, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice this raw coprun you have.
        If, hypothetically, I were to buy some, would you want currency or trade
        in exchange?&rdquo; Up close, the metallic green of the Volt is
        complimented by muted grey-browns and coppery details. A small diamond
        shape of pale orange energy dangled on a delicate chain from the edge of
        his helmet, which swung gently as he tilted his head slightly with the
        question.</span

        pacing around the corner. ~The warframe with its hurried step kept
        looking back towards where it came from, as if running away from

        realizing who it bumped into. - &ldquo;Uhhh..&rdquo; - It freezes for a

        >Zereth: Down the market ways of Cetus walks a Tenno dressed in fancy
        clad robes. White, airy silks with golden embroidery flowed in the warm
        afternoon cetus breezes, held together by golden ornamentations and
        clips. In a sense, the robes were akin to an Orokin-inspired toga
        wrappings of sorts. Bracelets rings and other orokin jewelry addorned
        the sunkissed lightly brown Tenno, shimmering along with strands of his
        blonde-brown dreadlocks. Zereth peered around The varying market stands
        with his curious golden eyes. He was snacking on some sugared ostron
        fruit from a small bowl ehilst he wss strolling. He was accompanied by a
        black Helios Prime, which was greadily eyeing and scanning everything
        around them as they moved, taking in more information. &quot;Keep
        searching, Helios.&quot; Zereth instructed whildt they walked. The
        pathway sand inbetween Zereth&#39;s sandals and his feet but he
        didn&#39;t seem to mind. With his head heaved the Tenno, inclined his
        head at some of the stand owners as he passed by, now and then gracing
        them with an elegantly, melodiously pronounced &quot;Swaz
        do-lah.&quot;(edited)</span

        a few drawings and other childlike craftworks inspired by Tenno and
        their Warframes. &quot;Tenno, Tenno! Look, look! Do you like mine?-- No
        mine!&quot; They shouted one, through and after another. Zereth gave
        them all a compassionate smile and petted their heads. They seemed to be
        familiar with this Tenno, or at least the ritual of greeting him.
        &quot;True little talents, all of you.&quot; He aid, squatting down to
        meet their heights. He took a few moments to look at their little crafts
        and then got up again, extending to them the bowl of sugared fruit to
        them. They each quickly and eagerly took some of the sliced, colorful
        sugared cubes while Zereth benevolently gave the last of his treats to
        the kids and they ran off with their candy. Zereth looked around with an
        accomplished smile while he looked through the various wares, only to
        have his tranquil stroll to be disturbed by the shouting of a heated

        were long gone now, but the scent still lingered on a particular

        pass by this Tenno. It didn&#39;t help that several Ostron children and

        the fleeing warframe with his eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t stand disturbances

        themselves.&quot; He said in a condencending tone, talking to himself,
        clearly too distracted to pay the passing Nidus any heed. His Helios
        however was more alert and started scanning the massive, mustached
        Nidus. Its ocular lens darted over the figure. The Helios approached the
        figure and made a quick circle around him. &quot;Aborting relic
        searching sequence. Scanning target recognized. Comparing
        variables..&quot; a cephalon-esque voice said while intensively Scanning

        volt she didn&#39;t see till it was too late the cloaked frame crashing
        right into her, the ground met her quickly as the shock rippled through
        her prime frame giving some of the gold trimmings a fine layer of dirt.
        Looking up at the extended hand and the apologetic voice of another
        frame, she slowly extended her own hand giving her head a light shake
        making sure the neuroptics didn&#39;t get knocked out of alignment.
        Hearing the tenno within the frame stop his speech and a
        &quot;ummm&quot; coming from it&#39;s vocal transmitter Inari looked up
        in a curious fashion, or as much as she could through the gold rimmed

        he had given that. It was tasked only to do so at rare high priority
        targets and objects. The sentinel had now strayed from Zereth whilst it
        was analyzing the nidus, closing in on it and following it around.
        &quot;Data analyzed. Comparison sequence completed. Target recognized;
        multiple scan overlaps recognized target as Bounty: Kapak. Wanted for
        multiple crimes. Current reward status 20.000 platinum. Returning to
        operator for rapport.&quot; The sentinel emitted through its speakers.
        Zereth in the meantime was already distracted by something else that
        caught his eyes. His golden eyes were fixated on the slender, curvy
        Mirage prime walking by him. His ears perking at the clacking of her
        golden heels. &quot;What a beautiful prime frame! So pristine and
        elegant. Consider my heart moved by the graceful way you wear it.&quot;
        He spoiled the unknown frame with compliments, trying to step infront of
        her to stop her in her tracks, trying to meet her up close with his
        golden gaze and a charismatic smile on his face, meanwhile his hand was
        theatrically placed on his chest upon his heart. Meanwhile he had
        forgotten his sentinel left his side to pursue a scanning target.
        Several Ostron heads lifted with frowning faces at the Nidus after the

        warframe&#39;s location and started darting towards the sentinel that
        had spoken, picking up speed slightly. Once he reached it, he stood near
        its owner, fidgeting with his coppery fingers while he waited for the

        combination of navy and gray adorned the frame, with pale green metallic

        velocity, deploying a black silhouette , falling down at a high speed.
        Zereth took position and stretched his arms out to the sky before golden
        void energy started crackling around his body. A pulse occured,
        transitioning him into void mode, turning into pure energy for the blink
        of an eye, shooting upwards towards the falling black frame.
        &quot;Transference.&quot; And at that moment Zereth merged with his
        Nekros prime, preventing the frame from crash landing, and instead
        gracefully landing upon his feet, Tigris prime locked and loaded.</span

        hissed as he drummed his fingers on a small collection of gutted Charc
        Eel, curled into the crux of his prosthetic arm, their heads hung low
        and swayed with the odd limping step of Lekalis. He&#39;d long since
        lost Muro, partially by some sense of boredom, but in truth... Lekalis
        had rather lost himself in the throes of comradarie, and now... Panic,
        he found in Cetus. Granted, much of that seemed to be secondary at the
        blip of Kapak&#39;s communique over the private clan channel. The threat
        of violence and death certainly had a way of reshuffling ones
        priorities. [&quot;I am here. I got lost.&quot;] He replied, late, as
        ever and via impersonnal text as he spied the unmistakable height of
        Kapak and the glimmering navy and silver of Muro. Hoping they&#39;d see
        the Strider&#39;s own, while impressive in its own right, no less
        downtrodden and decrepit looking frame... That, would be pointless.
        Instead, he heartily raised his free hand and waved gaily as he began to
        make his way over. Like a fish returning home, he slipped through the
        tide of frantic peoples with ease. &quot;Curious : do you enjoy
        senseless slaughter? Danger?.. More... Innocent blood. On our bloody
        hands?&quot; He hummed in reply, over the Remnant comms. Though, his vox
        betrayed it with subtle clicks as he spoke. &quot;Ostron blood is...
        redder than Warframe blood. It will stand out, and everyone will see
        it.&quot; Lekalis waved his hand dismissively as he came upon Kapak and
        Muro, he stood infront of them boldly. Charc Eel in hand. &quot;We </span

        once you betray the peace of Cetus?&quot; He inquired over the local

        Perhaps it was the clearly grineer-styled prosthetics, or how at ease he
        seemed to be, but the volt found himself reconsidering his offer about
        the bounty. A closer look revealed a steel meridian pin on the Loki and

        moment. Vuko extends his frame&rsquo;s left hand forward, as a half cyan
        energy, half matte black material composite bow with a reticle made out
        of energy appears in his hand. With his right hand he reaches to his arm
        quiver, taking out two arrows. He puts one on the ground and loads the
        second one onto the string, pulling on it. As he aims back down on the
        three unknown Tenno, he sees the Mirage drawing the pistol on the
        Nekros. As soon as the public transmission is over, he once again opens

        ear-piercing screech, distracting everyone for a few seconds. During the
        brief distraction Vuko quickly loads, draws and releases the second
        arrow, this time aimed at Kapak, hitting him dead square in the

        Tenno here were being honest, or if this was a ploy to make them drop
        their guard. Muro let out a brief snort in response to Vuko&#39;s
        complaint, as he didn&#39;t quite enjoy the prospect of having to fight
        other Tenno as much as Vuko apparently did. He wasn&#39;t sure how this
        standoff would play out, even if it was possible that the other Tenno

        himself vanished from view. He knew this trick all too well: one of

        make a run towards the beach. Fortunately, the ruckus had caused most of

        Volt around, he would not have wanted to run in the first place. He
        noted his comrades retreat, and his vents hissed as he brought down his
        good arm from protecting his marred face; a reflex borne from that
        grating noise arrow. &quot;Disappointing : let&#39;s leave Lekalis. Oh
        yes, he is very wise, so charming with his limp... I&#39;m sure

        prosthetic, he held his hands out in dismay. Looking for his dearly
        departed comrades fruitlessly while he stood in the market, bowing his
        horned helm to the greenish Volt, &quot;Ah, Hello there.&quot;
        Lekalis&#39; brought his hands together peacably, pressing the tips of
        both prosthetic and pristine metal fingers together in a steepled, kite
        shape. His vox clicked, as he shifted to the Remnant comms, &quot;We

        Perhaps: Put a bag over his head at the least? Yes.&quot; Again, his vox

        &quot;Where are the others with guns, my friend?&quot;, Lekalis inquired
        as he shuffled forward, his helm on a swivel as he rolled his good arm;
        his gill like vents opened and shut one last time. His Harkonar
        Breastplate began to whirr loudly, the fan blades of the core vent

        out for her. Turning his attention to the battered Loki, he watched the
        warframe approach and returned the bow that followed. &quot;Are you with

        >Inari: The high pitch screech of the arrow threw off her sense of
        equilibrium for a split moment, Ivara warframes were the only ones she
        knew of that had those kinds of munitions, she dropped the lex for a
        second shaking out the loud ringing from her audio receptors. Bending
        down the Mirage picked up her sidearm and looked around seeing that the
        emerald Volt was now talking with what seemed to be a very Frankenstein
        version of a Loki prime, the two looked like they were talking things
        out rather than trying to kill each other, which to her was just fine.
        She turned her back on the Nekros and strolled over to the two frames
        catching bits of their conversation as she closed the gap, &quot;mind if
        I join in on the conversation?&quot; she asked politely as the two
        looked slightly in her direction as a notification of her enterance,
        &quot;I&#39;d rather not ruin such a nice day either if it&#39;s all the
        same to anyone&quot;.</span

        >Zereth: The Nekros raised his hands as the five Lex&#39;s were pointed
        at him. He groaned a bit, looking around whilst his Tigris prime
        remained in his tight grip. He listened intendly to the broadcasts over
        the communication channels that he had access to. He holstered his
        Tigris, and looked at Inari, his visor keeping track of the real one,
        paying no mind to her mirages. The Nekros was startled by the loud noise
        of the arrow, but only briefly before ceizing the opportunity to
        dismantle the Mirage when she dropped her Lex. The Nekros&#39; palm flew
        towards the Mirage&#39;s chest while void energy coalesced into a Soul
        Punch and would coax the operator of the frame with a powerful push if
        his attempt were executed succesfully during her moment of being
        disarmed. If he succeeded she&#39;d be sent flying into one of the
        market stalls in her operator form. A soul punch would normally punch
        the soul out of a Grineer or Corpus, but since warframes are being
        operated through Transferrence it&#39;d be akin to being disconnected
        from their frame until they&#39;d establish the link once again. The
        Nekros lifted his feet from the floor, hovering over it slightly as he
        moved over to the other two frames closeby. &quot;I am not your
        enemy.&quot; Zereth expressed with the utmost calmth, as the shadow of
        the dark angelic frame towered over the two. &quot;But I do not like
        being framed..&quot; He&#39;d said, as he gently placed his skeletal
        hand upon the Volt&#39;s back. &quot;Going after the bounty was your
        idea after all, it&#39;d suit you to own up to it.&quot; He said, whilst
        his visor scanned the area briefly, noticing that the target had gotten
        away. He then turned back to the Loki Prime. &quot;Your friend damaged
        my sentinel. It became a personal matter.&quot;</span

        hill and the Solareans beside him who were loading up goods into their
        cargo ship. He had gotten what he needed from Cetus- a Zaw made of
        Infested parts given to his friend Hok the weaponsmith to assemble. Now,
        he was just waiting to make sure his friends got what they needed, as
        well as Mataeru&rsquo;s groceries, and make it out alive. Not that he
        was particularly worried- the Veiled Tenno had a track record of
        victories according to their shadowy leader, and The Strider, while
        being pretty peaceful on a normal basis, had an aura like he could wipe

        back over his shoulder, as he started to relax slightly.
        &quot;Well,&quot; he began, &quot;looks like you&#39;re the only one
        here. Is this going to be a consistent thing with you? I heard you were
        wanted, but I didn&#39;t think the reward would be enough for other
        Tenno to be after you.&quot; He would have continued, but he was
        interrupted by the familiar click of Lekalis&#39; voice in his ear. As
        Lekalis finished his statement, Muro responded. &quot;Sounds like a plan
        Lekalis. I&#39;m with him now, so I can wait with him until
        everyone&#39;s ready to leave. They may know he&#39;s here, but
        they&#39;re probably not going to try to collect now.&quot; He paused
        for a moment, realizing where Lekalis likely still was. &quot;Sorry for,
        uh, leaving you there. You going to want backup or do you think
        you&#39;ve got this?&quot; Muro shook his head as he asked. This was

        exuded power; the flare of void energy and the fact the Tenno used the
        skill at all spelled out a temprament that Lekalis was wary of. All the
        same, his vox clicked, switching to the Remnant&#39;s communications.
        &quot;It... Might be best to leave. Yes. No worries : I could have
        followed. Chose : not to.&quot;, he bowed to the Nekros kindly now. His
        helm rose, looking to the assaulted Mirage before taking a subtle step
        or two back from the Nekros again. Lekalis&#39; vox clicked and switched
        from the Remnant comms to the Open comms of Cetus. &quot;My Friends : My
        Allies. Personal matters concerning My Friends... They are mine
        too.&quot; With a haphazard, cheeky, motion the Strider tapped the
        bronze inlay of his scarred Knave helm. Lekalis looked to Volt who named
        himself Geordie with a quirked helm now, &quot;Good Geordie... Does not
        seem interested : In the Bounty : Anymore.&quot; Lekalis&#39; helm
        nodded punctually, as though deeming Geordie innocent. The Strider&#39;s
        Loki Prime stepped forward towards the Nekros now, assuming a step more
        past where he&#39;d stood before. His back straightened as his gills
        clicked open and sighed, then shut again; his Harkonar breastplate
        hummed hotly, but quietly. &quot;I wonder, though...&quot; His tone drew
        quiet, conspiratorial. The rainy noise of his vox faded for a moment as
        he leant forward; making to invade the Nekros&#39; personal space. The
        Strider&#39;s helm looked past the Nekros, to the Mirage who&#39;d been
        Soul-Punched; he motioned to her, as the Sunny Eye of the Strider set
        its sights on the Nekros. &quot;... What will we do with people who...
        Damage. Things?&quot; Lekalis&#39; hands drew together in a fast
        becoming signature steepled kite shape, resting his wrists on his

        good reason that bounty is so high.&quot; He took a breath, hoping he
        could talk his way out of this situation as he had with so many others.
        &quot;I admit I made a mistake by getting involved in all this before
        knowing everything there is to know about the target. I&#39;m sure you
        can understand why such a high price one someone&#39;s head would catch
        the attention of a businessman like me. He makes a good point,&quot; he
        motioned to Lekalis, &quot;starting a fight here, in the marketplace,
        would certainly get us in trouble. I don&#39;t know about you, but I
        like to be able to return to places I&#39;ve shopped at before.&quot;
        Geordie watched Lekalis close the gap between himself and the nekros,
        impressed by the Loki&#39;s air of calm understanding, while still
        scolding himself for being so quick to pounce on a bounty without
        thinking of the consequences.</span

        looking back to the Loki. The vox of the Nekros crackled rasply before
        uttering Zereth&#39;s message. &quot;Enough chaos has ensued thanks to
        the reckless actions of that heap of imperfect infested taint that
        operator calls a frame. I want reparation for my sentinel who was so
        provocatively shot out of the air whilst it was on a task I had given
        it. I&#39;m all for avoiding reprisal of this violence, since I&#39;d
        like to maintain my bonds with the people of cetus. As for the mirage, I
        disarmed her after she pointed her firearm at me. I&#39;ll make sure to
        handle reparations with the stall-owner, but I fully acted within my
        right to defend myself.&quot; The Nekros Frame&#39;s lich-like eyes
        gazed in dauntless manner into the Loki&#39;s visor whilst it&#39;s
        operator explained himself. The Nekros&#39; cloak waved in the cetus
        winds, while silence befell the formerly bustling market of cetus. The
        first squad of guards could be heard in the distance, spearguns and
        cetus lanterns in hand. The Nerkos looked over his shoulder and scanned
        the units in the distance. &quot;I believe we&#39;ve overstayed our
        welcome for now. How about discussing this in a more civilized manner
        over some tea. Surely, you are able to broadcast to your destructive
        friend.&quot; He said, invading the Loki&#39;s personal space, tapping
        the helmet, in the location most warframe broadcasting systems are
        implemented. The Warframe flicked his wrist, deploying another beacon a
        few feet away from their group. &quot;Deploy Wings of Shadow.&quot; A

        The neuro optics came back first giving her only a view of the ground,

        figured they were probably in the market earlier and saw or at least
        heard part of their little &quot;incident&quot; with those other Tenno.
        Even in such a noisy market, the sounds of gunshots and sonic arrows
        would have stood out, to say nothing of the image of a warframe rushing
        through the crowd with a large shotgun in its hands. Muro sighed
        inwardly, realizing how bad that must have looked. Before his
        introspection could continue, however, Muro&#39;s attention was yanked
        back by Vuko suddenly standing very much in Muro&#39;s personal space.
        From behind his Warframe&#39;s helmet, he raised his eyebrows, not quite
        understanding what Vuko had in mind. &quot;Yeah?&quot; he said, somewhat
        hesitantly. &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;</span

        >&nbsp;Growing curious about Lekalis&#39; unusual way of speaking,
        Geordie stayed silent and watched the interaction with some interest.
        The forward and backward movement of the two frames was not unlike a
        dance, and Geordie soon decided this dance was for two people only. He
        stayed out of the conversation, opting not to interject at the risk of
        complicating the situation - which he had already mucked up so horribly.
        He did, however, perk up noticably at the offer of tea. </span

        civilized way of solving this dispute. Facing eachother seated, with
        cups in between us, would be less likely to end in a fight, and we are
        teetering on the knife&#39;s edge of one at the moment.&quot;</span

        >&nbsp;The Helios surged with energy as it laid broken on the floor,
        kickstarting its internal systems once more. Magnetic waves of energy
        started to pulse from the damaged sentinel as it drew in its shattered
        parts, attempting to repair itself. The damage was manageable for the
        machine, and its reassembly process went relatively swift. Zereth looked
        to the damaged Helios with delight. &quot;It seems he wasn&#39;t
        completely beyond repair, that is good. And convenient for your
        friend.&quot; He said to Lekalis before picking the Helios up from the
        floor whilst it reassembled. &quot;What do you propose we do?&quot;
        Zereth inquired, peering over the top of the helios at the rest of the
        group.</span

        Muro by the arm of the frame away from Kapak, and back towards the huts
        he came from. As they get further and further away from the Nidus he can
        overhear part of what Vuko is saying, but the rest is unintelligible. -

        piped up and nodded in due respect to the desires of his newfound
        tea-mates, &quot;There is a cooksfire not far from here...&quot; Lekalis
        glanced off to the westmost part of the small town, and hummed,
        &quot;... There will be seats, it will be: good, comfortable,
        warm.&quot; For a moment, Lekalis&#39; sunny gaze drew distant, before
        his vents clicked open and shut; steam venting out rather exponentially
        as his Harkonar breastplate found itself whirring again. &quot;Perhaps
        the : Tragic, Unfortunate, Truly Innocent Victim Nekros can tell us what
        his Helios was doing?&quot; He inquired over his shoulder as his hooves
        clicked over the off white stones of Cetus, before they struck the
        pebblesome earth off the main path. Though Lekalis continued to find
        something to clink; the teacups and cannister in his hand idly rolled
        about with graceful ease in the tenses and wans of his ashen, coppery
        digits. Both rustic metals catching the odd glimmer that danced across
        either surface like a sea of shining rust.(edited)</span
