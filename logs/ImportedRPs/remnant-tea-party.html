        >&nbsp;]<br />-Lua, Remnant Sanctuary Hangar, Outside Lekalis&#39;
        Mantis-<br /><br />&lt;03/26, 08:08&gt;<br /><br />~Amidst the Hangar,
        set neither in a corner nor the center, was Lekalis&#39; Mantis. The
        source of a dancey, jivey and whistling tune that echoed out across the
        expansive room.<br />Standing like a bug of the same name, with its
        legly struts holding it aloft as a gentle mist emanated out and around
        its legs. <br />The soft mists came out from bubbling, jury-rigged
        cannisters of some Grineer origin; the factory markings haphazardly
        painted over with a white paintbrush. In the stead was the two circles
        and dashed line of the Steel Meridian. Each were about a foot high, hung
        from the legs of the Strider&#39;s Mantis.<br /><br />Many things were
        hung off those legs, in fact, with thick salvaged cables strung about
        and connecting each leg with a black chord from which even more things
        hung. Besides almost countless plants and roots and herbs, there were
        fantastically styled rugs, carpets and fabrics made of strong and
        durable materials. Tarps, more than anything; but their utilitarian
        browns greens and greys were painted over with reds, oranges and blues
        with gleeful, reckless abandon.<br />The flourishes on the tarps mocking
        the camouflage typically adorning Grineer products.<br /><br />As busy
        as the air around the Mantis was, the ground was equally cluttered; old
        and broken storage containers and lockers were set about as impromptu
        chairs, with pillows and cloth draped over them to give some measure of
        comfort, hopefully. The odd table seemed to be made from exploded
        barrels and the like, with scraps of ship hull making for warbled but
        relatively flat surfaces.<br /><br />And, standing on one of these
        tables, was The Strider himself; idly and gracefully tying a red braid
        around one of the thick red chords. His hooves deftly moving around a
        circular set up of tea, along with a jug nearby.~</span

        >With a glib cheer, he tied the end off on the red braid; letting his
        hands fall loosely around his waist as he cocked his head to one side,
        admiring his handiwork for a moment before giving a shivery shrug.
        <br /><br />Sighing and letting his whistle fade for a moment before he
        hopped from one table to the next, &nbsp;fishing out another chord of
        red silk to fasten about the cable strewn from leg to leg of his
        Mantis.<br /><br />His whistling subsided to idle humming, upbeat, a
        word occasionally escaped his vox as his hips swayed from side to side
        in tandem to the tune; tapping his hoof against the scrap metal table as
        he seemed to be finishing the last decorations to his small
        caravanserai.</span

        steam, as if a pipe had burst. Several moments later, a circular piece
        of metal plating rolled towards the table, stopping as it bumped into
        it. Following the piece of metal came 3 monkey-like, infested resembling
        creatures, one holding a blow torch and the other holding a Synapse.
        They squabbled with the third one, making belching and screeching noises
        as they pushed and shoved at each other. Eventually they reached the
        table, oblivious of the rugged Loki standing there.</span

        >A few seconds after the tune echoes in the hangar, another playful one
        begins harmonizing along. Its timbre is soft and airy, similar to that
        of a flute, but sounds muffled, as if held behind something. It goes up
        and down in pitch with great easiness, and often performs graceful
        melismas in between these changes. To the musically trained, this
        impromptu accompaniment would take the form of a series of joyful
        semiquavers jumping and sliding across the lines of the stave as if it
        were a children&rsquo;s sandbox. The source seems somehow able to
        foresee the silence in the melody as it briefly pauses at the same time
        the Strider moves from one place to the other, and resumes its
        performance shortly after he continues his part.</span

        palette of the spacecraft, moves her spread arms and legs as if trying
        to make angels in the air. Her eyes are closed, and her lips are sealed,

        coup de grace.<br /><br />While he turned to face Sigyn with a cheery
        nod (The red ribbon properly bound and hung) he didn&#39;t stop his
        little ditty as he smoothly produced his Marelok from its subtle holster
        behind his back and loosed three rounds at each Infested Monkey-like

        shots to miss. They collided with each other, falling over, quickly
        scrambling to get up, but slipping on the bloody floor, causing them to

        environment quietly, but with a tolerant warmth that was tied to the way

        midsection, with intricate patterns all over the rest of the thick and
        massive body. What it held was arguably even more massive - a new
        effigee, made of various Corpus helmets. <br />They were formed into a
        pyramiid, with a base of Provas to keep it stable both from within and
        externally at its underside. As it went up, there were carefully stroked
        paint marks on eacch helmet&#39;s faceplate, going up to the next helmet
        with a conversion of color. It resulted in rainbow-themed lines, ending

        pluffy ring of fluffy white creme seemed to resist the urge to melt into
        a deeper brew of cherry blossom hues. While remarkably garish, there was
        something beneath the stylizations that begat a gross amount of
        preparation beforehand.<br />Indeed, from the corner of one&#39;s eye,
        it might seem like a deeper shade of midnight blue churned in and unto
        itself, threatening to break free at the slightest crack.<br />But
        looking at it properly, it all seemed fine; whatever vicious turbulence
        brewed beneath the surface, never made manifested itself beyond the
        pinkish veil.<br /><br />It smelled fresh and sweet, the creme`, upon
        closer inspection, had the faintest hints of toasting along its ridges,
        and flakes of some unfound baked goods had been sprinkled along its
        surface.<br /><br />There was a soft fizz to the pink, given the slight
        disturbance. Steam slowly wafted out from its surface as well.<br /><br />Close
        to it was perhaps the humblest looking drink, with little more to its
        color than a deep red hue, that flashed with brilliant, yet soft, red as
        light caught the subtle ripples in its surface. Even closely set amongst
        all the other cups, this one seemed alien from the rest in its
        simplicity. <br />Writhing beneath this simple exterior, however, was an
        immutable shadow. It occasionally caught the light and gave a twinkle
        like the stars but never more. It greedily held itself beneath the
        waters and, while the first cup seemed elusive when looked at; this one
        was almost voracious in holding one&#39;s gaze. At times, it seemed like
        an entity unto itself, when gazed at intensively.<br /><br />Its scent
        was doubly strong, a scent like tart gooseberries and ripe meat. It was
        perhaps one of the strongest odours, the most repulsive, yet there was a
        definite allure to its desperate strength. This too had a small wisp of
        vapor emanating out from its surface like a miasmic fog.</span

        There were streaks of white spiraling across its surface, that delved
        deep into the dark, as though to confirm the impossible depth.
        Occasionally, it looked like faces were illuminated by the winding
        chords, like ghosts trapped within.<br /><br />This one held no smell,
        rather, a sensation intruded upon the back of the mind. Less a
        thought-provoking idea of smell that drew up images, rather, a base
        instinct; an impulse of senses both simple yet complex. This was a
        drink, and one was meant to drink it.<br /><br />Next was a somber drink
        of far less contrast than the last few; this held a humble grey hue with
        harsh angles of silvery gold cutting jagged lines across an otherwise
        simple surface. Like a cage, it held the greyness in check.<br />There
        was a level of discipline instilled into a person just by looking at it,
        there was a definite way to hold this cup. There was a definite way to
        drink this cup.<br /><br />Even its smell was straightforward in its
        scent, it smelled of fresh rain, forboding a sudden shock of sharp
        sourness that held it all in check.</span

        drink started with a dazzling golden hue, that mingled with a deep blue,
        before filtering downwards towards the base to a darker black, while the
        golden hue turned to a voidly teal.<br /><br />Like a breeze, the smell
        of this drink wasn&#39;t readily apparent to anyone without the mind to
        take note of it; it smelled of preserved dates and roots. A smell both
        like home, yet the unknown. <br /><br />The last cup was empty.<br /><br />Sigyn&#39;s

        subtle kick of Ruk&#39;s Klaw spicing to it, of course, though that came
        from deeper in the brew.<br /><br />The Strider looked about the group

        >~Vuko&#39;s cup, perhaps the most transparent in its taste, would warm
        the more he drank; it seemed less reliant on temperature and more on the
        brew itself. What flavors arose followed suit in the wake of the scent;
        though what he tasted first would be a curiously soft and almost ashen
        dryness, that served more to warm the mouth than invoke any flavor.
        <br />Past that was the predicted lemony tartness, reining back the
        swiftly growing warmth, that proceeded to ripen to a sweeter, sugary
        flavor.<br />The brew went through this cycle with every sup of the tea,
        t&#39;ill there was nothing left.<br /><br />Next, unsurprisingly, was
        Kapak&#39;s decision; the meaty brew only grew and grew in its intensity
        as it neared his frame&#39;s pores. Dipping his finger within the depths
        of red... something dipped back. A quick sting that was only realized
        when he downed the brew and what felt like a nettle bomb exploded, not
        in his percieved mouth or stomach, but in his very cells. It was in
        every mouth, every stomach that this brew found itself. <br />At first,
        it felt like a toxin, overwhelming... Then, imbuing. As quick as the
        sting came, it became a sooth; a boon that broadened and eased itself
        into his system. It was bitter then soft. A wild berry that ripened from
        nightshade; the flavor was there, upon all of him.~<br />[1/2]</span

        to come a bit delayed, despite the grandiose decour. For all its
        bluster, the sweet looking creme` and pinkish film was the most
        tasteless, the only flavor came from the sharp shavings of baked goods
        that tasted crispily sweet. The true flavor came from the midnight blue
        substance beneath, that fizzed and popped with the veil gone. That
        substance, indeed, proved itself to be less of a single hue and more of
        a spectrum of colors.<br />Despite the broad range of hues, it looked
        more like oil in the way it turned to rainbows in the light. But they
        did not seem to inspire happiness, only a slowly closing darkness that
        threatened to envelope each flicker of color as the ripples subsided.
        The more disturbed the brew became, the more color bloomed.<br /><br />Indeed,
        upon her second tasting, the full sweetness of the brew came at last; a
        dream of warm, sweet flavors, and fluffy textures sank into her cheeks

        Tenno perused his options carefully. The brew of blue and gold intrigued
        him, so he leaned in for a closer look. Gazing into the drink, he felt
        as if its visage of dizzying brilliance tore his soul from his chest and
        laid it bare for all to see. His face slightly paled and all at once
        felt the toll of the weight of his blood. Unseen spindly fingers wrapped
        themselves around his heart, causing him to softly pound a fist upon his
        left chest. He needed to drink it. He needed to liberate himself from
        the liquid. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to let anyone else whisk away his
        own being with as little as a single gulp. His hand compulsively shot
        out and grabbed hold of the cup. He desperately drew it near him and
        clutched it close to his chest, his eyes captivated by its

        mimic a sip out of it. Nothing happens, only a small wet line forming on
        the Rhino&#39;s face, left from the drink. Oro&#39;Kino cringes from a
        deep anxiety, and decides the time is now. He has his Rhino rise from

        Tall and lanky, Oro&#39;Kino&#39;s entirely confined in a white
        Zariman-style suit with golden little metal bits here and there. What
        stood out the most was a hole on his mask that revealed his mouth, lips

        despite its simple appearance, the closer he peered, the deeper the cup
        seemed to be.<br />In some ways, it seemed there was twice the amount of
        possible fluid in the cup than should have been possible; the subtle
        twinkling stars deep within gave this illusion, being larger at the top
        and dissipating near the bottom.<br /><br />Yet, the more Disruptis
        stared into the darker depths of the cup, the more it seemed something
        stared back. Or, rather, the more he stared into the cup; the more he
        would see his own reflection in the dark abyss of the bottom.<br /><br />It
        was a curious trick. The gold film atop the cup slowly faded, to his
        eyes at least, t&#39;ill it was all but a starry blackness not too
        unlike a clear night sky.<br />The isolation imbued through this vision

        and white.<br />The drink immediately numbed &nbsp;the tongue, whether
        it was from the chill or some reagent in the brew, it wasn&#39;t clear.
        It was only apparent that a liquid was travelling down his gullet like
        quicksilver, until the flavor hit him as the inkish drink sloshed in his
        stomach.<br /><br />Like hands, the flavor spread out through his
        stomach and up his asophagus again; a taste of home, of fresh air and
        freedom. A fruity, grape-like taste finally settled on his tongue,
        though it swiftly reformed and fell in line behind a kick of sourness,
        like medicine.<br />It stole his breath away, and left behind a coppery
        after-taste, a brief explosion of a flavor come too quick and gone too
        fast. It was a billion familiar tastes, it barraged his senses, swept
        through his spine like an electric current and burned his brain as
        though it were on fire.<br />And yet, in the same moment, the homely
        flavor of grape settled again. Giving his breath back.<br /><br />There
        was an unbidden desire to taste the vile flavor again, if but to really
        affirm that it had happened. He would only be able to taste the barest
        remnants of it on his breath.<br /><br />Despite the hefty punch of the
        drink, Oro&#39;Kino&#39;s brew looked hardly supped upon. The ice-cube
        bobbed merrily too and fro, with the black tendrils almost shivering in

        *<br /><br />*He remembered the places of his meditation, a place of

        vacant and hollow, another was drawn from an unspoken dark.<br />In a
        veiled, curious voyeur, Disruptis was beholden to this thought; A Shadow
        of himself supped from the drink that was his, testing it for poison.
        Protecting him whether he wanted it or not.<br /><br />As a flavor of
        ripe apple settled on his tongue, his mind seemed to ripen just the same
        with knowledge. <br /><br />Cloudy memories of artefacts studied,
        archeology and history abound, became instantly clear to him...
        &nbsp;They were curious ventures, but none held the answer.<br />The
        Shadow that was Disruptis, tasted nothing, it sat and supped from the
        cup, the true host of the corpus before him floated in the emptiness of
        the Void. Watching, waiting...<br /><br />-- A stabbing pain brought
        Disruptis back from the ethereal out-of-body sensation the cup insighted
        upon him, a visceral, bloody pain bloomed from his gut; as though his
        intestines had been torn through a hole there. The pain subsided, and
        with it, the memories of the experience altogether. The flavor of apples
        played in the back of his tongue, almost an apology for the pain.~</span

        >[3/3]<br />~In Oro&#39;Kino&#39;s cup, the flavor came back... Yet it
        was somehow colder on his tongue, almost stinging. Indeed, deep in his
        gut, as the draft settled, it felt like frostbite might spread out from
        his core. The flavor was desaturated this time, but still felt of home.
        Yet the aftershock was coppery still, stronger, if anything.<br /><br />A
        bloody flavor warmed his mouth after the shock of cold, it was an
        uncomfortable respite against a comfortable pain.<br />An endless storm,
        and an endless shelter. It was a visceral cycle that threatened to
        repeat itself with ever sip... Yet a collapse would come to both, soon
        enough. <br /><br />It came at the bottom of Oro&#39;Kino&#39;s cup this
        time, the ice cube having left a square of chilled and raw meat above
        his lip; it seemed he&#39;d drunk his fill unwillingly. But at the
        least, the flavor of memories lingered, and the gentle touch of petals
        seemed to numb spots beneath his suit, upon his skin...~</span

        >Disruptis watched the whole unreal experience with wide eyes. When the
        pain came upon him, he dropped the cup onto the table and doubled over,
        clenching his heart. His face warped into something between a rigid grin
        and a pained expression.</span

      ><span class="c5 c1"
        >Then the sensation lifted from his shoulders all together. The slight
        shock sent him reeling. Had that even happened? What had happened? The
        Tenno pondered these questions as he looked back to his drink. It had
        fallen perfectly onto the counter, not wasting a single drop. Did it
        even fall in the first place?<br /><br />He savoured the sweet taste of
        apples as he pondered these things. His hands now grabbed the cup again,
        and his eyes stared into it once more. The experience was oddly
        nostalgic.</span
