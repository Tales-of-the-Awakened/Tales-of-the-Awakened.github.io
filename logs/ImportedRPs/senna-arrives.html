        00:28&gt;<br><br></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4 c8"><br></span><span>Senna:<br></span><span class="c5">She dropped down from her
            Liset, using her Valkyr, she looked around, examining the environment, she was used to the Orokin ruins but
            wanted to make sure there was nothing around, she was drawn to this place by the mystery, of not only the
            signal but also the tenno who went missing</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">~The source of the signal seems to be coming from the remains of a hallway now
            serving as a tunnel leading deeper into the depths of Lua~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span>Senna:<br></span><span class="c5">She looks over at the hallway and starts walking over to it,
            peering inside before walking in, Sybaris at the ready</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&quot;Anyone around? If
            you&#39;re Grineer or Corpus just uh, pretend you can&#39;t hear me&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">~The only sound she can hear is Lunar winds drifting through the corridor, periodic
            Luna Pitchers growing in the darkness~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span>Senna:<br></span><span class="c5">She keeps walking down the corridor, rifle raised for anything
            that might come rushing down the hall</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&quot;Well then, it&#39;s either an
            ambush or a sentient... or nothing and i&#39;m being too cynical&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">~After a couple of minutes, the body of a Rhino can be seen lying against a wall, a
            large gash across it&#39;s chest, and a Dera resting on the floor beside it, and further down, more
            Warframes lay still, weapons still in hand or scattered around~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span>Senna:<br></span><span class="c5">She looks down at the rhino, poking it with the barrel of her
            gun</span><span>&nbsp;&quot;Huh, someone must&#39;ve killed the janitor too&quot; </span><span
            class="c5">She looks around</span><span>&nbsp;&quot;So... what killed them, time to find out&quot;
        </span><span class="c5">She raises her rifle, walking past the bodie</span><span class="c3">s</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~From down the hallway, there was the echoes of something- crunching, slurping,
            sucking. The shadow some something pulsating and oscillated, the outline illuminated by the light shining
            through cracks in the fallen Orokin architecture~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She watches the outline</span><span
            class="c4">&nbsp;&quot;Oh, well, at least someone&#39;s doing something with all these bodies&quot;
        </span><span class="c5 c4 c6">She moves closer</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The shadow stops and is silent. What appears to be a head perks up and looks around,
            the true nature of whatever the thing is masked by the wall of hallway it was down. It turned and bolted
            away, a skittering noise as the only remains of the thing.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She watches it bolt off</span><span
            class="c4">&nbsp;&quot;Awww, My frame&#39;s not that ugly is it? Oh well&quot; </span><span
            class="c6 c5 c4">She keeps walking, now on guard that she&#39;s seen something alive here</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Another short walk brings her to a familiar room with 4 pillars and a console at the
            end. However, the Security Eye that would be guarding it is nowhere to be seen and the console appears to be
            the source of the transmission~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She examines the room before walking over to the
            console, prodding at it with a clawed finger</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&quot;This looks like one of the
            rooms with the security eye... where is it? One of the ones before me get it?&quot; </span><span
            class="c6 c5 c4">She looks over her shoulder to check behind her</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">A voice echoes down from the shadows
            above</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;You are brave to enter this location Tenno. Tell me, what is it that
            you seek, and why are you searching for it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She looks up</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Well, when i heard the mention of... the long war and the help part, i felt like i
            should come, to join whatever sent out this message.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">And Ash drops to the floor a ways behind her
            and looks at her</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;You came of your own accord then? Why did you feel the
            need to help?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Senna:<br>&quot;Yes, i came of my own accord. Usually I wait for someone else to tell
            me to do something but, I feel the need to help because well, it just feels like the right thing to
            do&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">The Ash crosses its arms</span><span
            class="c0"><br>&quot;And what about your ties to the Lotus? Do you work for or support her efforts in the
            System at the present time?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">The Valkyr shrugs</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;I have worked with her, yes, but I prefer to work with the Steel Meridian wherever
            possible, but i am not working for her currently&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">The Ash remains motionless for a moment before
            a young adult appears in front of it</span><span class="c4"><br>&quot;Working for Steel Meridian is a noble
            cause.&quot;<br></span><span class="c5 c4">He bows before resuming</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;My name
            is Mataeru Lloria, and I am currently leading the group of Tenno hidden behind this message. I take it your
            investigation here is because you desire to join us?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">The Valkyr looks down at him before becoming
            motionless as well as she too comes out of her Warframe, appearing in front of it</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Well yes, i came here to join you since that is the case, i half came here to see
            what happened to the Tenno who disappeared but yes, to join whoever it was that sent out that
            message&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">He raises his eyebrow</span><span
            class="c0"><br>&quot;I will warn you, we are about to enter a war against four factions. This is not going
            to be an easy task...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She shrugs</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re Tenno, it&#39;s never been easy for us, whatever or whoever we&#39;re up
            against, i&#39;m in&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">He reaches his hand out</span><span
            class="c0"><br>&quot;In that case, welcome to the Orokin Remnant. I look forward to working with
            you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She grins taking his hand</span><span

        <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br>&quot;Come, I will lead you back to our command center. We will be
            relocating soon, but it will still be an integral part of our operations for a while.&quot;<br></span><span
            class="c6 c5 c4">he gestures her to follow him as he disappears, his Ash taking a step to her right, heading
            to a hallway out of the room</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c6 c5 c4">Senna:<br>She disappears as well, her Valkyr following him &quot;So, I saw
            something eating stuff in that hallway earlier. Any idea what that was?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">his next step falters for a moment before he
            continues</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;I... do not. That is... Something I will investigate. What kind
            of behavior did it exhibit?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br>&quot;Well, it ran off when it looked at me, so it must be
            anti-social&quot; </span><span class="c6 c5 c4">She keeps following him after he falters, not having noticed
            it</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br>&quot;Interesting... I suspect I know who that creature belongs to... And
            if I am right, I will have to exercise more strict quarantine measures...&quot;<br></span><span
            class="c6 c5 c4">he leads her deeper into Lua, the rubble slowly disappearing and being replaced with dark,
            yet pristine Orokin Architecture</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">Senna inspects their surroundings as they
            walk</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Huh, never figured there&#39;d be anything this pristine on
            Lua&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br>&quot;Most of the damage you see is on the outer location only. the
            interiors of the moon are still in good repair.&quot;<br></span><span class="c6 c5 c4">they walk for a few
            more minutes before coming to a dead end. Mata touches it with the palm of his hand and it slowly begins
            sliding sideways, revealing a short hallway. The Ash moves forward into the hallway</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br>&quot;Huh, i suppose that makes sense, the reservoirs were in pretty good
            shape as far as i remember&quot; </span><span class="c6 c5 c4">The Valkyr follows after him, head forward,
            finished taking in the surroundings</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5 c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The small hall behind the door opens up into a nicely furnished room with a couple
            of couches and chairs, a Dining set, fireplace, and a corner with full
            bookshelves~<br><br>Mataeru:<br>&quot;Welcome to Sanctuary Tenno. We have a barracks here and a hangar that
            you can bring a landing craft into should you choose.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">She looks around</span><span
            class="c4">&nbsp;&quot;Oooh, fire~&quot; </span><span class="c5 c4">She clears her throat</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Alright, so there&#39;s actual food here? Yessss&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mataeru:<br>&quot;Yes. Although Orokin Cuisine was unobtainable, I have procured
            things from Cetus, as well as other trade settlements. I cannot cook partiularly well, so more complex meals
            will need to actually be cooked.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">Her Valkyr rubs it&#39;s hands
            together</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;I suppose i&#39;ll bring my landing craft to the
            hangar&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">The Ash nods and moves over to a corner of the
            room and goes Rigid as Mataeru appears in front of it and begins typing into the air in front of him. A
            moment later a message blips on Senna&#39;s HUD</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;I have just sent you the
            coordinates to the hangar. Would you like a tour of the facility? Or would you prefer to
            explore?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Senna:<br>&quot;I think a tour would be nice, i don&#39;t want to stumble about not
            knowing where i am&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">he nods and gestures her to follow
            him</span><span class="c0"><br>&quot;I will take you to the hangar first then. This way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Senna:<br></span><span class="c6 c5 c4">Senna stays in her Valkyr, following
            him</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~After a short walk, they enter a massive hangar room with several landing Craft
            inside already~<br><br>Mataeru:<br>&quot;This is the hangar. We will be departing for missions and rallying
            together here before departing for them. You can repaint, repair, tune up and restock supplies for your
            orbiter here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Senna:<br>&quot;Alright, i may as well bring my landing craft here now
            then&quot;</span></p>

            Landing Craft, soon enough, a mostly purple Liset would fly in</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mataeru:<br></span><span class="c5 c4">he gestures her to follow him once more and

            left, you will see the foundry, and then the bio lab upcoming. Followed by the Barracks and Gym on the
            right. The Kitchen is connected to the lounge.&quot;</span></p>
