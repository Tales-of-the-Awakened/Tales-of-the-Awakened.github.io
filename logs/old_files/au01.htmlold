                            ~DING! The elevator doors to the cozy main room aboard the Chalet Station open, and out walks an absurdly tall, twisted and overall bizarre Nidus Warframe.<br />In this creature’s clutches is a long, wide tray with piles upon piles of cookies, sandwiches and other goodies that the Warframe was attempting to avoid drooling on.~<br /><br /><u>Kapak:</u><br />“Oh my,” the Warframe growled through a surprisingly functional mouth, “this stuff smells too good. Don’t eat don’t eat don’t eat...”<br />The Warframe spoke to itself as it laid the tray onto a table in the center of the room.<br />“Ah. There we go. Now I just need some people to show up to prevent me from eating all of this deliciousness... I guess people should be arriving soon!”<br />Kapak looked at a clock mounted on the wall.<br />“I hope Leks gets here soon with all that tea! Can’t have snacks without a drink, I tell you.”

                            /Lekalis/<br /><br />Rampant possibilities ran ripe through the Strider&#39;s mind as he patiently waited at the bottom of the Elevator; it seemed these devices took forever to come down and go up, and were always too crowded... even when he was alone.<br />Just as the fibres of his patience were about to snap and he reasoned a vent looked breakable enough, a dull thrum announced the arrival of the Elevator back at the base of its channel. Lekalis didn&#39;t hesitate as his battered Loki Prime slipped into the tube and easily flicked a toe up to poke at the console, beginning the delivery of himself up to the predescribed locale for tea.<br /><br />Tea, of which, was held heavily in his arms; laden with a familiar and simple iron dish whose corners were chipped and jagged, and its surface more than a bit warbled... But it was <i>familiar</i>. He knew its grooves and awkward slants, so that the variety of tea still steaming in equally iron cups, all stayed still but for the slightest of wobbles in movement that only served to stir and brew the substance further.<br />Unlike most of Lekalis&#39; proceedings, this setup was a bit more extavagent; Ruk&#39;s Klaw, Lunar Pitchers, and all measures of ingredients were arrayed throughout in a wreath along the dish. Small red berries were laced throughout like so many little lights. The oils of the berries glistened in the lights that passed over the Strider and his array of tea as he ascended within the Elevator shaft.<br />[1/2]

                            [2/2]<br /><br />For once, the ascent was short and joyous; Lekalis&#39; heart was unburdened by any woes, rather, he was all afloat in all measures but the physical as his half-horn helm wilted to one side in surprised delight at the &#39;<i>DING!</i>&#39; of the Elevator&#39;s arrival.<br /><br />The doors opened, and Lekalis stepped through with his tray full of tea, and spied the table just as the metal dias began to wobble precariously; there was a flicker of orange light as a Decoy apparated beside a Nidus, and another whirl of sunny twinkling as the Strider Switched with the Decoy to drop the tray rather gracefully but... loudly, beside Kapak. <br /><br />Who, with much glee and perhaps some exasperation, Lekalis finally acknowledged with a spriteful pirhouette of a bow.<br />&quot;Apologies : The rain delayed me.&quot;

                            <b>Leveret</b><br />The food had been the part that stressed Leveret the most in preparation for this event. He wasn&#39;t used to potluck-style gatherings, and the canned fish and stolen rations his defector friends made do with at their dojo-turned-base seemed inappropriate.<br /><br />He&#39;d settled on bringing a variety of Cetus fish, salted and spiced and roasted on sticks to create an enticing aroma unmatched by anything he&#39;d normally encounter.<br /><br />The elevator ride was itself exciting, full of the smells of all the other foods already carried upwards inside it.<br />[1/2]

                            [2/2]<br />At the top, the battered orange and white frost squeezed eagerly through the still-opening doors into the room beyond.<br /><br />&quot;Hello hello!&quot; he said loudly, excitedly spying a table full of goodies and some of his Tenno friends already waiting! Placing the fish-stacked black metal pan on the table, he first moved to Lekalis to give the battered Loki one of the standard Steel Meridian handshakes, which quickly ended with a powerful hug, another of which he bestowed upon Kapak soon after.<br /><br />&quot;Looks like not everyone is here yet,&quot; he commented, &quot;hopefully folks will arrive soon!&quot;

                            Rize <br />&quot;Woah woah careful, just a little further.&quot; Rize told herself as she was bringing in a small tower of meat from earth, mars, and other places which were wobbling ever so slightly which made her nervous wanting to make the best first impression she could.  Waiting for the elevator to come down she wondered who she would be meeting.  <i>DING</i> &quot;Finally, elevators always take forever. <i>SIGH</i> Oh well time to get up there before something bad happens.&quot; Rize said as she got into the elevator carefully then hit the top button with her foot which almost made her fall over with the tower of meat for this party.  And then the elevator reached the top floor far faster than it did coming down for some crazy reason.  Rize then exited the elevator only for her to start falling over.  &quot;WoahwoahwoahwoahWOAH.  LOOK OUT!!&quot; Rize shouted as she began to toss the containers with the food onto the table with skill you normally would expect of a tenno using a warframe rather than a red veil member.  &quot;Woo, that was rather close. <i>heh</i> Nice to meet you all i&#39;m Rize.  Forgive the introduction i really wanted to make a better one but i was starting to lose my grip on the meat i brought.&quot; Rize said slightly cheerful but mostly out of breath while falling back somewhat exhausted.

                            <u>Kapak:</u><br />&quot;Ah, excellent!&quot; Kapak cracked a smile across his cherry-like head as the faint aroma of the tea escaped from the vessel Leks had set upon the table. The thud had indeed startled him, but just a tad.<br />Kapak watched, leaning against the table as Leveret approached the group, giving the familiar Frost a grin and a solid nod. Once the Nidus received the embrace of Leveret, he couldn&#39;t help but stiffen up awkwardly.<br />&quot;Uhhh... thanks Lev...&quot; Kapak choked on his words, &quot;good to see you too.&quot;<br />The Nidus&#39; breathlessness was not a result of Leveret&#39;s tight squeeze, but rather his awkwardness when it came to physical acts of affection that were greater than a hearty handshake.<br />As Rize entered the room with his meat, Kapak couldn&#39;t help but drip nearly a whole bucket of saliva from his jaw onto his own feet.<br />&quot;Ah, yes, Rize, very nice to eat- I mean, meat... er, meet you!&quot;

The words ran through her mind as she shakily carried a few ornamental dishes of savory cooked Murkray and Charc Eel, even if her Banshee was holding it in her stead, the shaking wouldn&#39;t truly stop.<br /><br />Very... delicious food. She shook her head as she entered another elevator, as she turned around... Runner realized Striker was beside her the entire time, shoving a plate or two into the Para Carrier&#39;s grasp.<br /><br />&quot;ELL-A, TROU-BLE?&quot; Her carrier would parse, its robotic tone revealing its childish intellect.<br /><br />&quot;No Striker, I just need a helping hand.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;STRI-KER, NOT- HAND.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;...Your... beam... Striker.&quot;<br /><br />The elevator ride wasn&#39;t as adventurous, but as the doors opened, her shaking would increase, she strode quickly, Striker saving some of the plates that fell, weighing him down with its pick-up beam, all the way to the table, where most of it sloppily slid across to escape her hands.<br /><br />&quot;G-Good- He-Hello!&quot;<br /><br />The Banshee quickly jolted away from the table, retreating with her Carrier to a &#39;less stressful&#39; distance.

                            <b>KAMOS &amp; ATELA</b><br />Well, just Kamos. At first glance. He exited the elevator himself a bit after Sudoko, because he had to, y&#39;know, wait for it to come pick him up. Why was this elevator so slow, and why were people going in one at a time? Whatever. The Rhino surveyed the room as he walked/stomped in, taking notice of Lev and Leks almost immediately. And y&#39;know, there were others, but those two in particular. He stepped aside from the elevator and stood there, sort of surveying the room for a moment. If anyone was paying very close attention to the table, they might maybe possibly see a salad that wasn&#39;t there moments ago. Made of all sorts of various Earth plants, it didn&#39;t look too bad. Still just a salad, though.<br /><br />The reason for its sudden appearance would become clear, when someone else entered. Well, &#39;entered&#39; wasn&#39;t the right word. Atela had, in fact, gotten here long before Kapak, through the power of vents and invisibility. She placed the salad whilst invisible, and moved back to the corner she had been waiting in this whole time, before uncloaking. And just like that, the duo was here. Kamos wandered over to where Atela stood a moment later, and the two nodded to each other and stood there in silence. Looks like people were arriving, finally.

He scoured the heads of everyone to see who had shown up and who hadn’t yet.<br />Leveret, Lekalis, Ella, Kamos, Vuko, Atela and the two newcomers. Strangely, Disruptis still hadn’t shown up, but that was no surprise. That void-headed dope was always either fashionably late or stupidly late. Cev might’ve been with him, or maybe he was out doing something somewhere else in the System. And of course, Isa... parties were definitely not the Corpus Tenno’s scene, but Kapak has figured she’d at least come to deliver some of her Nutrition Bricks.<br />Still no sign of Muro, who he figured would’ve come with Vuko.<br />Kapak shrugged to himself and grabbed a handful of meat, throwing it into his maw and sealing the lump whole. The others Would come, eventually, perhaps. And who knows who other newcomers may appear?

                            Jay’kin was operating his warframe through the hallways. Attempting to make his movements seem fluid as possible as he’d begin to silently stare at the area around him. <br /><br />“Oh boy... this is the right place, right? I don’t wanna interrupt the grinner if they’re having curfew.. wait I’m suppose to do that.. I mean it would be rude.” He began saying in his head, the six foot piece of metal beginning to appear against a door; watching it open as Jay’kin would begin to look around the area.. seeing many different Tenno. <br /><br />“Mother scrap... that’s a lot of people. Bugger. What should I do?... This is making me more sickly then a Nox.” <br /><br />A loud WHIRRING was heard as Bugger spoke inside his head in this annoying, hoodlum like voice. “YO, YO, YO! Just be chill ku-<b>bro-</b> we will be as cool as a arctic eximus! Perhaps you should say hi man?!” Bugger bugged out after saying such loud things. <br /><br />Jay’kin gulped and nodded, whispering. “Y-yeah you’re right... h-here is go.” He’d take his first step into the room and suddenly he trips. Falling face first, yep... this was it. His social curse begins.

He then survey the room and spotted some well known guises, which confirmed the locale was indeed correct.<br /><br />He stepped off the elevator to allow it retreat back down, clutching onto the wrapped box with his good arm, worrying the contents be disturbed in the slightest. His free arm found a comftable spot behind his back as he waited to be greeted and introduced into the party.

As the elevator sped upwards, the Tenno shifted his weight, his arms burdened with what looked like an explosion of plant life.<br /><br /><b>Muro:</b><br />&quot;Are you sure they&#39;re going to like these?&quot; He asked the MOA, his face obscured by the many blooms he was carrying.<br /><br /><b>Aurelia:</b><br />&quot;Of course they&#39;ll love them, will you stop worrying?&quot; The MOA responded incredulously.  &quot;Anyone would think to bring food, but no one would think to bring something like this!&quot; Though it wasn&#39;t visible through the Warframe&#39;s helmet, Muro rolled his eyes good-naturedly.<br /><br /><b>Muro:</b><br />&quot;You can say that again.&quot; He murmured, before shifting his grip again.  The MOA snapped its optic sensors upwards towards the Tenno. <br /><br /><b>Aurelia:</b><br />&quot;I heard that.&quot; She huffed.  &quot;And please Muro, for void&#39;s sake be careful with those. If a single one of those arrangements are out of place I will hold you personally accountable.&quot; Muro almost couldn&#39;t hold back a chuckle at her threat.<br /><br /><b>Muro:</b><br />&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Just then the elevator jerked to a stop, signaling that they had arrived at their floor. As the doors opened, the the veritable cascade of floral scents that the elevator had been containing spilled into the main room.  Muro decided to take initiative and step out into the room, though he couldn&#39;t really see in front of him.  &quot;Hey everybody! Sorry we&#39;re late.&quot; Aurelia entered behind Muro, flanking him on his left. (1/2)

Looking around for a brief moment, Aurelia spotted a fairly empty table. “Muro, there’s a table approximately four meters in front of you. Be a dear and <i>carefully</i> set those arrangements down there. Muro grunted affirmatively and slowly strode in the indicated direction, carefully testing his steps to ensure he didn’t trip over anything. While he was occupied, Aurelia noted a few familiar faces and strode towards them. <br />“Good evening Vuko, and you as well Kapak. Glad to see we aren’t the only ones who are late.”<br />(2/2)

There, on the regular ferrite and alloy, was a glowing yellow crack. <br /><br />The crack seemed to extend infinitely into the wall which constantly churned like an event horizon on an orange and red hue. It was by far the weirdest thing Disruptis had ever seen. He swiftly placed his baggage on the floor and ran a hand over extraterrestrial apparition, only to find it cleanly enter the hole. Curious.

Done.” Vuko let out in a satisfied voice.<br /><br />The Ivara then quickly left the table, clearly ignoring and trying to get away from the conversation, maybe finding it boring, dull, or who knows what. The warframe started to make rounds around the room, trying to spot any familiar faces, which there was surprisingly little of.<br /><br />First he found Lekalis, but.. well they’re not really talking, and for good reasons.<br /><br />Close to him was Ella, hidden away in a corner. Not much to talk about with either, so he just politely nodded to her.<br /><br />Then there was Kapak again, stuffing his face hole. If Vuko had to know one thing about him, is to not stand between him and a meal. So not much to do there either.<br /><br />Sure, there was way more people, but did he really want to interact with them? Maybe later... Propably once the party kicks off properly. Or maybe give them a chance...?<br /><br />He was about to choose a random individual to go and ‘socialise’ with, but then came another elevator ping. And who would’ve guessed - inside is his brother and his brother’s cephalon. Just like that Vuko was off towards him, his right hand going for the bro-liest of handshakes.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br />Disruptis paced down the eerie halls once again. His focus was glued to the special synoid gammacor mounted onto his hand. It was feeding him information about the recently scanned abnormality he had left to security.<br /><br /><i>15,502,600,000 cubic meters? Muck, that’s the max limit on this thing. It’s probably even bigger!</i> <br /><br />He mulled over these thoughts as he called an elevator. Today was an open house. That meant inviting a bunch of Tenno interested in the /RU corporation, and possibly people who were just interested in having a peaceful moment for once. First impressions were key.<br /><br />Disruptis straightened the white tie hanging around his Limbo’s collar. He would have to worry about the whole rift-inside-the-wall thing later, now was time to enjoy the company.

Both the Rhino and the Ivara seemed content with staying out of the fray here. Judging by very small movements and gestures, it would seem the two were speaking to each other. About what was unknown, as they were likely talking too quietly for anyone to hear, but they spoke. There was the occasional glance toward the salad from Atela, but that was about it.  Generally, it would seem the two were currently staying out of this party right now.

And worry not, there&#39;s a plethora of guises picking my interest; I simply prefer to take my time digesting the encounters.&quot; He said with a coy smile behind the &#39;mask&#39;, he wasn&#39;t one for comedy, but mixing social gatherings and wordplay were one of the few small treats left unfazed by the passage of time.<br /><br />&quot;I would be delighted to have you join me for a game of Komi afterwards, if that would interest you, Leveret.&quot; He added, as he turned back to the table to slide the box&#39; lid completely off. &quot;And please, use the spare sets freely.&quot; He offered at last, as he pulled one of four Komi boards crafted in full Orokin fashion; the grey marble inlaid with gold filigrees matched the black and white pieces, each with a meticulously engraved sun or moon on their surface, matching their respective colors. The board pulsed with faint cyan energy as the magnetic surface sprung to life, demanding it be played.<br /><br />&quot;The first move will be yours, Jay&#39;lin.&quot; He pointed out while handing them the small compartment filled with the black pieces.

He cracked a wide, mischievous grin on his face, saliva still dripping from the Warframe’s skeletal maw- looks like Kapak had been gorging himself with food once again.<br />“That’s a nerd game,” Kapak spoke, shifting his head to alternate between looking at Jay’lin and Lupin, “for big nerds to play. Last time I saw someone playing this dumb Orokin waste of time was in Orcus... some weird Excalibur who didn’t speak to anyone was just sittin’ in the middle, playing anyone who decided to sit down next to him. Muckin’ nerd I tell you.”<br />Kapak snapped his finger as he raised it from Leveret’s shoulder, pointing towards the others.<br />“Know what a real game is? The Index. That’s right, a REAL game where only the toughest, meanest fathermuckers can spill enough blood to win.”

A evident smirk is growing across her face as she plops down to sit on the Nidus’s shoulders, her legs dangling from around his neck.<br /><br />“Ey ey!”<br /><br />I boost with that cheerful and excitable tone, my right hand dropping down to trace a circle pattern on top of Kapak’s sticky head<br /><br />“Index good!

He began focusing upon the game, nodding at Leveret for a moment before addressing Lupin. <br /><br />“So I see you’re much of a knowledgeable person; I’ll be glad to take you on.” <br /><br />He said with determination. Putting one of the black circles in the center of the board. Letting himself have a head start, although he knew very well he could be boxed out almost instantaneously in the next three rounds; he has a plan and that’s all that matters.<br /><br />“Let this game begin, shall we?” He said with a good mood towards his voice; taking notes of all the different people now and even a operator. Maybe he should’ve got out of his own metal shell, but who knows? Perhaps this party was warframe only... or not. He didn’t know any better and his stomach was telling him to leave before he embarrasses himself.

That is not to say I did not come prepared-&quot; He added as a small swarm of seven gold and black beetles crawled out of the warframe&#39;s neck joint and marched down one arm to reach the table with military coordination; the well trained soldiers continued onto the nearby meat slab, pinching tiny pieces before returning triumphantly towards the Inaros.

Knowingly or not, she finds herself flitting across to the foodstuffs. Pausing there, she examines her surroundings a second time, one silver-gold hand raising to fiddle with an ornament of her helm&#39;s circlet, but stopping short, she resumes her hand to her side and shifts from one foot to the other.<br /><br />At last, however, she lowers herself to both knees and rests her hands in her lap, the Warframe assuming a strange calm befitting of the regal, scarlet cloak that half-curls about her side. Noticeable now is a large greatsword slung between her shoulders, the edge keen and cutting a thin groove in the floor before its owner settles.*

Sighing in relief, he began to set the collection of flowers on the table. He still didn&#39;t understand why Aurelia had to go and prepare so many of these arrangements, but at the very least he was happy to be done carrying them. Hearing footsteps approaching him, Muro turned around to see Vuko striding towards him, arm outstretched. <br /><br />&quot;Vuko!&quot; he said loudly, joyously walking towards him. Muro returned his handshake tightly before pulling him in for a brief bro hug. &quot;Sorry we&#39;re so late, Aurelia wouldn&#39;t let us dock until she had finished her gifts.&quot; Pulling back a moment,  Muro looked over Vuko&#39;s shoulder towards the rest of the room, noting the unfamiliar faces mixed in with his friends. &quot;Hey, who&#39;re the new people?&quot;

A deep pout shifted my happy expression, like a toddler being picked up when behaving wrong.<br /><br />“No fun no fun!”<br /><br />I boom with my arms crossed over my chest as the Frost set me down, the face behind my mask showing clear displeasure! But…as always, my focus doesn’t stay as long <i>”No no, let it flow…like Clempo’s tea!”</i> I chuckle to my own thoughts and shift my gaze towards the gathering, or more precisely, towards Lupin. I let out a low hum, tilting my masked head to the side as a delighted grin spread across my lips.<br /><br />“Oh? It’s a eating gathering no? How you eat in those bulks?! And…not very friendly to walk about in your carnage machines hmmmm?”<br /><br />I grin at the end of my lightly spoken words.<br /><br />“Well! Not counting these guys”<br /><br />I add, pointing with my thumb at the Nidus as one of “these” guys, like some sort of race hate.

His distant heart rose and fluttered enough to send his head in a tizzy as he took a few steps back from the commotion, to find some reprieve from the noise and social ecumene&#39;s before him.<br /><br />He muttered some distant hello&#39;s and goodbye&#39;s until he found a seat, upon the floor neath the window Vuko had invaded through; The Strider&#39;s hands fidgeted over his sash and produced a familiar iron cannister that shook in his prosthetic hand, while his good hand procured a triad of iron cups which he set afloat beside his lazily sat form.<br />In some measure of recollection, he methodically saw to pouring out a hot, bubbling and clear liquid into each iron cup as his eye watched the proceedings in a humming, droning silence.

Ko in two...&quot; He mumbled to himself cocking his head to one side as he surveyed the board. &quot;An aggressive move, yet you don&#39;t strike me as one to maintain such offensive fervor.&quot; He added while fidgeting with a sun piece between his fingers. &quot;Ah, of course.&quot; With equal restrained enthusiasm he placed the piece completing a solid 3-piece string. [ <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xc445yD.png">https://i.imgur.com/xc445yD.png</a> ]<br /><br />With the move in place, he turned his head back towards the rest of the amassed party, only to find the others had been drawn away. There was nothing he could do to salvage the floor at the moment, lest he offer the stack of credits to hire a dedicated crew. Instead, he focused on the table overflowing with food and the mention of alcohol, which he now caught the fragrance of in the air.<br /><br />&quot;Take your time with your move, I shall return shortly. I think it high time I shed away from my gilded companion.&quot; He informed Jay&#39;lin, pushing himself away from the table and board, making his way over to the the outside-facing wall; he gave the mysterious figure an acknowledging nod before knelting a comfortable distance away, certain not to disturb them, proceeding then to take on a more comfortable meditative position. Wisps of deep purple energy briefly spewed from the warframe&#39;s back as the elegant frame of a young man emerged materialized.<br /><br />The black-haired tenno took a moment to straighten out his long flowing suit and properly affix the shoulderpad. Taking one more moment to check his reflection on the nearby window, he found himself pleased with the highlight upon his svelte figure and sharp facial features; he held his hands behind his back, and returned to the party with a stern and heavy, yet graceful step.

He was still working on the whole ‘boundaries’ thing, but he was confident he’d picked his spot well - at least this time.<br /><br />Should Lekalis glance in his direction, he would offer a quiet thumbs-up and head tilt, as if to ask, “you good?”

Not a one overflowed, and each had a equalized rise of fluid; a soft sizzle brimmed and frothed at the lip of each hovering cup as the Strider&#39;s vox sparked up in its signature and staticky filter.<br />&quot;Hello Leveret.&quot;<br />Lekalis agreeably accomodated the Frost&#39;s sittings with a bow of the brow. The red braid on his one good horn bobbed and danced in the motion.<br /><br />&quot;Would you like : tea, chatter... silence?&quot; He inquired humbly as his eye finally broke its attentions to look at Leveret,<br />&quot;It has been awhile : unfortunately, sadly... You look happier out of the rain.&quot; The Strider&#39;s hands moved as if posed about by some puppetteer, each finger twitching and wrist moving as if tugged along by a string. Graceful still, in a curious, mechanical way as he produced a lock of Ruk&#39;s Klaw roots and a root like ginger in his hands. He held them ready, as he waited for Leveret&#39;s answer.

He placed the black piece onto the bottom of the middle piece/ opening two more pathways for victory. He awaited with a smile for his friend to come back.... but realized something; his friend got out of his warframe. <br /><br />He gulps, watching the black-haired boy adjust himself as Bugger began to speak. <br /><br />/Bugger/<br />“Yo, I know what you’re thinking! Change man! Live a little!” Bugger commented, beginning to get ready for transference. <br /><br />/jay’lin/<br /><br />“You’re right... Lets do this! Cowabunga it is...” He got up from his metal suit and placed it against the nearest wall. Taking a deep breath, he’d begin to brighten from his frame before materializing in a very matter-like manner. White streaks of puffy clouds slithering from his form as the boy appeared. Deep amber eyes filled with the fiery passion scanned the room, a parted black hair cut with a nice combed over look on top of his head. He wore the basic garbs of a villager from Cetus, seeming to have gained some of their armor from before. <br /><br />“Oh wow... I feel so tiny, well... back to some Komi.” He went back to his side of the seat, smiling slightly and awaiting Lupine to come back eagerly. <br /><br />(<a href="http://imgur.com/a/Fxblxfi">http://imgur.com/a/Fxblxfi</a>)

I’m fine with either.” He said.<br /><br />With a flash of orange-gold light, the Frost’s body dropped slightly as Kinsey sat forward and separated themself from their frame. “There we go! That’s a bit better for tea.” They said, grinning, a friendly sparkle in the eye that wasn’t covered by the grineer-esque device. (Whether it was a patch or some visual device it was hard to say.)

I never knew : Why, how... what. Tea I made.&quot; he admitted as he nodded once in kind to Leveret&#39;s declaration.<br /><br />The Ruk&#39;s Klaw roots were already so fine, and the power behind the Loki Prime&#39;s digits so great, that the substance was ground to a powder with a snap of his fingers. The pale substance trickled out and covered the liquid, ceasing its frothing nature with a veil of bone-like powder. The next were shavings of the ginger root, which the Strider idly clove free with the nail of his good hand as he spoke on,<br />&quot;I made tea for myself : alone, dark, silent... For the longest time. Between deployments, between bloodsheds.&quot; The Strider shrugged and the root has been finely sheared off into the cup, gone in his hands. Now, he dipped the slightly ashen hued little finger of his good hand into the brew; the finger was far from little, rather grotesquely long like a spine on a fish... but it slid through the powdery veil and began to stir.<br /><br />&quot;I used to be so... Good. With crowds : communes, forums, festivals...&quot; The Strider hummed, sadly, and pulled out his little finger and examined the slightly viscous substance with some scrutiny.<br />&quot;... But... those times are like... dreams. Now. Distant but waiting : on the horizon, behind the closed eye, the dead mind.&quot; The Strider&#39;s hand stiffened, and looked to Kinsey now with some bemusement, before shuddering like a cat spritz&#39;d with water. <br />[1/2]

More flush, with rosy hues on the joints: knuckles, wrist, digits... The harsh jagged cuts of chitin and plugs for unknown fluids weren&#39;t gone, but galvanized in scar tissues.<br />The Strider&#39;s fair wrists were loosely bound in jade, each holding a strong red ribbon, the size of his lithe arms themselves, flowing back to his elbow where another jade band rested easily about the slim elbow.<br /><br />His fingers moved with an almost hypnotizing flair, there were trinkets and baubles of bronze and jade and ruby again, set about his long willowy fingers whose porcelain nails clinked quietly upon the iron cup, cradling it within a cage of pale flesh and jade binds.<br />&quot;I will forget : this tea, these faces... These... warm. Times.&quot; there was a soft fizz and crackle of radiation that microwaved the tea to warmth again.<br /><br />The arms extended out, holding the teacup  in both hands, out to Kinsey. The limbs looked weak, but stronger than the skeletons they&#39;d appeared in the past.<br />The hands still shook with some small strength that struggled to hold the cup aloft.<br />&quot;So will you. Like tears : in rain. It frightens me.&quot;

It’s hard to keep all their faces apart after they’re...gone. I keep pictures of all of them in my orbiter.”<br /><br />They took a cautious sip of tea, watching Lekalis over the rim of the cup.<br /><br />“We’re here to help you, though.” they added. “At least, I am.

As advertised, he was inside his typical black and yellow limbo, with the dainty addition of a white tie. He stood there pondering for a good couple of moments.<br /><br />Then with a quick change in stance, the Limbo briskly walked into the room and took in the sights and smells. Everyone was here. Everything was perfect. <br /><br />“Hey hey HEY!” He shouted ecstatically, “now this is what I&#39;m talking about!”<br /><br />Disruptis swung his bag of cutlery and plonked it right on top of the table. Lekalis was here with his tea, Muro and Vuko were exchanging manly pleasentries, Sonera was acting as free spirited as ever, Leverett was here with a sunny vibe, and Kapak was here… getting involved in more infested shenanigans. Even Kamos and his rare friend Atela had come out. And oh… the newcomers. He&#39;d love to make rounds and get their stories the most. His adventurer’s heart was easily kindled.<br /><br />Disruptis scanned the crowd for his favourite golden Saryn, but didn’t manage to find her. He clicked his tongue. <i>Well, I guess not quite everyone.</i><br /><br />For now, he&#39;d settle for his friends’ greetings. “Vuko, Muro, Kappa, Sonera, Lev, Lekalis, Ella, Kamos! Glad you could make it. Hands up!”<br /><br />He chased after each member and tried to give them one of his signature quick high-fives.

After a moment of collecting herself, she began watching as some began to shed their frames to witness their dreaming selves. For a long moment, there was a pause in the Banshee&#39;s actions, as if itself was to judge whether to shed its precious controller. Standing against a wall, a small, lithe form would shakily waltz from her frame, a hood drawn over her hidden face, clothe of orokin origin would sway in her stead, feathers swaying of regal breeds, the longest of her shoulder, and of one peeking out of her hood, of an earthly aurora.<br /><br />She would approach the table of mouthwatering goods, her stomach growling for a feast to digest as she began to sit, slowly descending like an elegant avian.<br /><br />She took a plate, beginning to take her own pieces, pointing to far off pieces for her Carrier to fetch. The Carrier spoke aloud to her with each request, much to her dismay.<br />“EL-LA, REQ-UI-”<br /><br />“Y-yes, you dumby! Quiet!” She hissed, tugging the sentinel back to her side once she had what she needed, listening in on the Strider’s words, exchanging a gaze of his pale arms, a hidden nostalgia presenting an expression of what was before.

He shuffled, trying (but of course failing) to conceal the long scar on the floor using his feet. He was only successful in covering about a quarter of the entire mark.

                            /Lekalis/<br /><br />&quot;Yes... You are : Here, present, aware. Around. Of sorts.&quot; The Strider nebulously agreed to the assurances of Leveret as the arms withdrew and delicately moved another of the iron cups to float before him. The nails, as refined as they were and as fragile as the limbs of the Strider appeared, looked impeccably proud and strong; a subtle pattern like scales had been engraved upon the surface using what looked like old dust, that caught the lights ever so slightly and shimmered with some distant Orokin radiance.<br /><br />Suddenly, the Strider gently exclaimed with some surprise,<br />&quot;Ah... I&#39;d almost forgot!&quot; His hands moved with haste, but still retained a characteristic grace to the way his arms flowed and peeled away at the sash bound about his Loki Prime&#39;s chest, and held a cup of small seedlings in his palm. Their shells were hard, but green, and looked almost like Old Earth Sunflower Seeds, though some might know their tougher exterior and greenish hue to be the adolescent seeds of Ruk&#39;s Klaw.<br />Even as Kinsey drank from the tea, Lekalis&#39; hands moved and popped the shell of each seed to drop the sharp smelling seeds into the brew; most dissolved, though some still fell to the bottom of the cup to be had later.<br /><br />The sudden blanket over the flavor was very apparent; the spice and kick of the ginger and Ruk&#39;s Klaw was reined back by those dissolved seeds, covering the otherwise spicy tang with something pleasantly sweet. Like honey and barley. It was a homely flavor, though the undertone of kick tasted almost like a pleasant twist on some Grineer Grokdrul brew.<br />[1/2]

You&#39;re a good friend : humble, honest, here.&quot; He swiftly recalled the topic at hand as his mistsome arms fell back and phased into his Warframe, where there was hardly a stutter in the transfer of motion as power returned to the Loki Prime; he looked to Disruptis, then Ella in kind with a measured wave of his prosthetic hand, while his good hand idly rummaged about in his sash.<br /><br />&quot;How are you, then? I have never heard you worry about yourself.&quot;

                            <b>Lupin:</b><br />He had taken his time to return to the table as to fully appreciate the party with his own senses, unfiltered by transference. His hands only broke free from each other&#39;s grasp to inspect the odd item on the table, to take in the texture and weight of the mouth-watering baked goods. Upon returning to the board, his eyes methodically scanned his opponent: an impeccable skin, devoid of void burn scar, a certain wild fiery defiance in their eyes, the well-maintained armor and neatly combed hair which spoke of dedication and attention to detail. <br /><br />&quot;I must say, I&#39;m delighted to see you&#39;ve chosen to join me in meeting eye to eye. The occasion to share time away from them and in the company of peers is often rare, and seldom pleasant.&quot; His voice was smoother in person than it had been through the somatic link, yet still carried a certain coarseness that betrayed the juvenile nature of their &#39;race&#39;. Only once the contrived attempt at pleasantries had expired did his eyes break away from his opponent and return to the board.<br /><br />&quot;A relentless offensive indeed, how quaint.&quot; He mused with earnest amusement as the faintest of smiles curled the edge of his lips. &quot;Forgive my bluntness, but are you one to find yourself unsure on the defensive?&quot; He asked with curiosity as he placed his next piece to the top right of the center piece, threatening the first piece of the match.

It was almost unnoticeable if one hadn’t very coincidentally looked at the spot.<br /><br />“you... uh-- is… um…...” <br /><br />Disruptis tilted his head and gulped. “Actually, I think the floor is much better!” He smoothly interjected, lowering his gaze to the surface, “look at its magnificent sheen and--”<br /><br />...then he saw the thin groove sliced neatly by the greatsword.<br /><br />“Oh… my… VOIDDAMMIT!

He kept his head down, not wanting to make any eye contact with anyone, as an interaction would surely occur then.

Almost like he was some kind of rock star, giving high fives to everyone. With little to do, he just raised his hand to receive one.<br /><br />“You know what. I’m just going to go have a drink.” He said thinking out loud, in a resigned voice, seeing the entire fiasco going down.<br /><br />Vuko swiftly made his way towards the closest wall. As he neared it, a mist of cyan energy formed behind the Ivara, quickly forming into a Tenno.<br /><br />It was a boy, neigh, a young adult, adorned in the finest of Orokin armoury. Light delicately bouncing off of the pale gold spikes, cloth moving in tandem with him, as if the Tenno was the wind given form. His hair was the color of the ocean during the fiercest of storms, shimmering between blue of the deepest of trenches and cyan of a warm shallow sea. And his eyes, if one was bold enough to look into them, were a dull amethyst, a stone once shining with radiance and vibrancy, but dulled by time and experience.<br /><br />Vuko left the warframe next to the wall, and went to mingle with everyone with confidence in his step. But first, just as he said, he made his way back to the table he had set up before and poured himself a glass from a bottle with shiningly green liquor.

They don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like.&quot; Kapak rested a hand on the Limbo&#39;s shoulder.<br />&quot;I know how the administration is probably breathing down your back about a ton of things already...&quot;<br />Kapak trailed off before snapping his head around to face Vuko. Of course, the Nidus could smell things almost as well as a Kubrow.<br />&quot;VUKO! WHADDAFRIK YOU THINK YOU DOIN&#39; WITHOUT ME, EH? LET&#39;S GO, EH?&quot;<br />Kapak waddled over to Vuko, with balled hands raised to his pits and his knees bouncing up to his waist as he enthusiastically crossed the room, likely bumping into a few others as he moved. As soon as he arrived at the table, Kapak grabbed one of the bottles and slammed the entire thing down- within seconds, an entire bottle of red was gone.

Now the partygoers were drinking, and there were just... so many unfamiliar faces. Why did they even show up? Atela had delivered salad, but no one&#39;s actually had much in the way of food. The two continued to quietly speak to one another, far too quiet to be heard over the party. They hardly seemed like they were particularly friendly, at least right now. This whole situation was weird, okay?

I do miss the Meridian, and Cressa...&quot; He hummed quietly, the shifting in his sash swiftly devolved to simple idle fidgeting as he pulled out the iron cannister from before and set it out below the hovering cups, which he then tilted over so the fluids would return to the container.<br /><br />&quot;... Ghouls, though? Dangerous, voltaile, literally explosive.&quot; Lekalis huffed, pluffing his shoulders in a shrug,<br />&quot;You are bold.&quot; He mused with a small chuckle as his movements became quicker and, while they had been inherently graceful before, an art returned to their locomotion. A direction, of sorts.<br /><br />&quot;Perhaps I shall come by sometime. If I remember.&quot; he poked lightly at his own worries as he pushed himself up and returned the iron cannister into his sash in a singular sweep. Cups, too, were slipped almost unnoticeably back into his sash.<br />&quot;I am feeling... : Better. Thank you.&quot; The Half-Horn Loki bowed his broken crown with some swelling pride as he rose and slipped his arms lightly into where the sash crossed his breast.<br /><br />Quietly, Lekalis motioned for Kinsey to follow him as he began to stalk his way across the walls of the party; his sunny eye switching between Kamos and Atela, and The Runner. As well as the enticing spurts of debauchery being carried out at the core of the room. There was a (dangerous) pondering yearning in his gaze, as he watched the drinks get downed.

The Strider&#39;s staticky vox cleared its throat, sounded more like a speaker getting unplugged than anything, as if he were testing his throat.<br />&quot;I remember I had to play : Stoic and sober for the Grineer. Tipsy and witless for the Corpus... The Orokin...&quot; Lekalis&#39; tone drew dire as his vox popped and he twisted the cylinders jutting out of his occular augment,<br />&quot;... It was fun, playing the fool.&quot;<br /><br />The Strider&#39;s path had him pass by Kamos and Atela with another small wave,<br />&quot;Hello there...&quot; He offered halfly invitingly as he continued on, watching them from his periphery to see if they might follow.

Kamos seemed to be nodding in response, noticable even before Lekalis was close. This conversation&#39;s probably been going for a while. Atela stopped talking, though, when she saw the Loki was here. She became silent, and merely kept an eye on Lekalis.<br /><br />&quot;Hey, Leks. Long time no see.&quot; Kamos responded to Lekalis, albeit almost uncharacteristically quietly. He would normally be speaking much, much louder than this. He raised his hand in a bit of a wave, again something unusually calm for him.

Even still, Lekalis was making more assumptions off of what he wasn&#39;t seeing than anything else. Their steely silence wasn&#39;t too uncharacteristic from Lekalis&#39; recollections, but it was still unsettling and perhaps a bit saddening.<br /><br />But, the chip and cheer of The Strider didn&#39;t wan much as his attentions settled on the solemn pair.<br />&quot;Curious : You&#39;re enjoying the party? the dining? the company?&quot;

You don’t seem the rowdy type.”<br /><br />He fell silent while Lekalis spoke with Kamos and Atela, but that little spark was still bubbling up, and he was starting to really hope to get in on some fun before the party ended.

She looked over at Leveret for a moment, shrugging and turning back to focus on Lekalis. &quot;I was expecting something a bit quieter, I suppose. Now everyone&#39;s drunk and yelling.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I mean, I&#39;m not against yelling and stuff, but I just dunno.&quot; Kamos followed up, after Atela was finished. He seemed less like his usual stoic, sort of vaguely angry self. He seemed a lot more calm. Lekalis and Leveret would probably both know he didn&#39;t act like this in combat situations. Maybe it was somehow related to Atela&#39;s presence. Regardless, Kamos and Atela both stayed where they were, surveying this party.

The duo before him held his rapt intrigue as he let his helm wilt to one shoulder, the good horn&#39;s braid touching his good arm.<br />&quot;... Perhaps we can gather we : gloomy, dramatic, fools. Together, find a suitably : gloomy, dramatic, foolish locale to mull about in?&quot; The Strider&#39;s tenor  was unburdened by static, and now seemed stimulated by the appeal of yet more comrades in arms. <br /><br />The Strider&#39;s good hand expertly flourished into and out of his sash to produce the two cups he&#39;d emptied just before, flashing them out with such speed as to make it seem nigh like an illusion. Yet an after image of the iron seemed to linger, even after the invitation was proposed.<br />&quot;I&#39;d a mind to join the drinking... But I imagine Kapak might spoil the competition.&quot; Lekalis teased the Infested Warframe from over his shoulder, knowing he would most likely not hear. The slight curl to the Loki Prime&#39;s scarred helm caught the backliight glow of the room, and the grisly wounds of shrapnel that had gored the Strider&#39;s helm seemed to flicker like the needle teeth of a cat&#39;s smile, or an eel in a brackish pond.<br /><br />&quot;My brew isn&#39;t inherently : toxic, alcoholic... Kicksome. But with enough Ruk&#39;s Klaw, a drop of Grokdrul..?&quot; Lekalis shrugged, his words turning from a staticky rain to a rolling river that poured over every word with grace and allure.<br />&quot;... I&#39;m going to see if I can&#39;t : rally, grab, entice... More fellows to be jolly with.  Shall I count you among them?&quot; The Loki Prime shrugged indifferently and eased unto his backfoot as his sunny eye flickered and glanced about the party; eyeing other members he thought to steal out for some midnight trist.

Atela shrugged again, getting to her feet in one fluid motion. Kamos was much less... graceful about this, just preferring to stand up like a normal person. He was never one for doing anything even slightly elegant. May as well get to the point, right? The two stood side-by-side now, seeming to be on board with this.<br /><br />&quot;Not sure if tea is a good idea, if it means leaving transference. Seems like a few other people are, though.&quot; Atela gestured around the room, as if to prove her point. No one here who&#39;s worked with either of the duo would have ever actually seen them as Operators, so this might be the first time either of them would willingly shown themselves.

I did make a few arrangements,” Disruptis reassured.<br /><br />Then a small hand tugged on his finger. He turned around to see a red-haired girl offering him a large book of some sort. It only took Disruptis’s naramon mind a couple seconds to search for the sword mounted to her Trinity’s back and make the connection.<br /><br /><i>C...cute…</i><br /><br />His Limbo went prone as an operator exited its chassis. The Tenno wore an equally flashy black and yellow suit with the hood down, revealing his jet-black hair and the disarming smile tugging on the corner of his lips. ((<span class="mention">#portraits</span>)) He grabbed the book with both hands and gently pushed it back to Elizabeth.<br /><br />“Don’t worry, I don’t need this. Instead--” he began to interject, until he tried to remove his hands.<br /><br />They held fast with a steel grip, and not by his own will either. He knew what cue this was.<br /><br /><i>Muck.</i><br /><br />“Uh, eheh. Actually, do you mind if I open it?” Disruptis sheepishly requested, embarrassed that he had to change his mind in such a situation.

Less in the contents of the story, but more in the age of the tome. It was an artifact, and Disruptis was an avid explorer at heart, so the pages of something that old were a treasure to behold. He almost wished he had accepted it.<br /><br />Eventually, Elizabeth held the book open to him to give him a look. Disruptis’s gut was punched with another uneasy feeling, already predicting what he’d find inside. He touched the pages gingerly at first, but after rifling through a few the yellow Tenno quickly resorted to using his thumb to quickly flip through them. A flash of yellow peeked out from one of the pages.<br /><br /><i>Uh oh.</i><br /><br />“Ah, yes!” Disruptis announced with a hint of nervousness. He grabbed both of the covers where Elizabeth’s hands were holding and closed the book.<br /><br />“Sorry, what was your name again?”

                            <b>KAMOS &amp; ATELA</b><br />The two stood there side by side, waiting on everyone else. Kamos had a far more relaxed and calm body language than he would ever have normally. Atela, meanwhile, looked quite on-edge. Whereas Kamos returned Lekalis&#39; pat with his own pat on the shoulder, Atela hesitated quite a bit before shaking Lek&#39;s hand. She really did give the impression that she didn&#39;t want to be here at this party. She did extend her own hand in a handshake eventually, after making sure Lekalis wasn&#39;t a threat at all.<br /><br />&quot;Look, all I&#39;m saying is that we&#39;ll be far more vulnerable without the Frames. Chances of some sort of incident injuring or killing someone would be significantly higher as an Operator.&quot; Atela explained in response to Lekalis, in a voice that gave the same impression that she wasn&#39;t particularly interested in being here. Vaguely annoyed, really. Not at Lekalis, just in general. &quot;And now that everyone is drunk, that&#39;s only going to get even more likely.&quot;

But...&quot; Lekalis shrugged and patted Atela&#39;s hand one last time before letting his fingers slip free of her grip (his own had been markedly light, in case she so desired to depart preemptively from the handshake.)<br /><br />The Strider glanced over his shoulder to the participants at the center, in their social deleriums, they seemed rather distracted... though, like flotsam to a tide, a new fellow seemed to be making his way over.<br />Quickly, Lekalis returned his attentions to Atela and his hanging sentence,<br />&quot;... But, they seem... shall we say : inebriated, inaccurate.&quot; Lekalis shrugged again as his sunny eye flickered in some semblence of a wink as he reclined back to rest his weight upon one leg, and his arms rested easily about his sash yet again.<br /><br />&quot;Regardless, you don&#39;t have to : remove yourself, risk injury, or death. Just some teatime chat, if&#39;n you&#39;d like.&quot; He hummed the last and turned away from the pair, glancing to Lupin with a small beckoning wave to follow as the Strider continued his striding about the room; a familiar warming gaze settling on Ella, as Lekalis stared at her as a cat might eye a canary.

He couldn&#39;t help but laugh at how upset Disruptis was at the crack in the floor. For the life of him, Muro couldn&#39;t figure why Disruptis would seem so high strung at a time like this. Shrugging it off, he couldn&#39;t help but smile as Sonera answered his call and started bounding towards them. <br />&quot;Well, I think I&#39;ll leave you two alone. Talk to you later!&quot; Muro started wandering away from his Cephalon towards the middle of the room,  As tempting as it was to join Vuko and the drinking party that seemed to be kicking off at their makeshift bar, Muro didn&#39;t share his brother&#39;s fondness for alcohol. Rather, he strolled towards the growing tea party, which seemed the be the tamer of the two options. Drawing close to Lekalis, he tried to casually catch the Loki&#39;s attention.<br /><br />&quot;Hey Lekalis, mind if I join you?&quot;<br /><br /><b>Aurelia:</b><br />Aurelia stood there, quietly grumbling to herself as her Operator went off to mingle with the other Tenno scattered throughout the room. She couldn&#39;t believe that he just... left her there! She didn&#39;t have long to dwell on those feelings, however, as it took Sonera mere seconds to make it to Aurelia&#39;s location. As always, the Wukong&#39;s boundless enthusiasm both impressed and befuddled her. &#39;Oh well.&#39; She thought to herself, &#39;At least he&#39;s willing to help.&#39; Drawing the MOA up to its full height, she addressed Sonera.<br /><br />&quot;Just Aurelia is fine, Sonera. In truth, I could use your help. See these flower arrangements?&quot; She motioned to the table, still covered in a dozen or small, but vibrantly colorful arrangements of plantlife, held in crystalline vases. &quot;I need some help decorating the room with them. Would you mind walking with me as I pick out some locations? I would do it myself, but as you can see, I lack the ability to carry anything.&quot;

He returned with vast steps and a near mechanical grace. They leaned closer to Jay&#39;lin, who had yet to make their next move.<br /><br />&quot;I am afraid you have no more winning moves; and while the prospect of a good Komi match with your company is indeed not beyond the realm of possibilities, my time, and perhaps yours too, would be better spent enjoying a cup of freshly brewed tea.&quot; The veredict was delivered with no trace of emotion for the opponent they considered defeated already, if not for amicable kinship. Without further ado, he turned away from Jay&#39;lin once more, silently following after the phantom brewer.

Apologies : I do not recognize you, remember you? Have we met?&quot; Lekalis chuckled with some bashful bemusement as he stroked the sash that was drawn across his chest.<br /><br />&quot;Hmmm...&quot; He noticed Lupin, too, and nodded to the other haunting Tenno that had decided to follow as well. <br />&quot;... You, as well; I don&#39;t believe I know your name.&quot; Lekalis hummed and then chuckled, shaking his head,<br />&quot;I apologize.&quot; He drew out the word with a sweet tune, the statick of his vox offering a hiss like rain to his tenor.

He could have sworn they had been introduced before, but maybe all this time had dulled his recollection of the past.<br /><br />&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m Muro. I was in the Remnant, same as you. Don&#39;t think we ever really worked together back then, except at the very end...&quot; Muro visibly shuddered. Of all the battles he had been in, that was one he wished he could forget.  Just then, a scene from his past flashed into his mind. &quot;Wait, do you remember a Tenno named Dormin? I think you and him were having an argument a long time ago, and I kind of stumbled into it.  You ended up throwing a tea cup at me.&quot; Muro chuckled at the memory, seeming so far in his past it almost felt fake.  &quot;Gotta say, I was glad to hear you survived that last fight with Vey Hek. Gonna need all the help I can get to pay that mucker back for what he did.&quot;   For a moment, Muro&#39;s voice dropped from its usual laid-back tone, his words tinged with an almost caustic anger. However, the moment left as quickly as it came, and Muro&#39;s posture visibly relaxed. <br /><br />&quot;Ah, but that&#39;ll come later.

Like a star seconds before a supernova, the orange light honed in and bored into the Tenno with the intensity of a gamma ray burst.<br />&quot;I remember : Dormin, an argument. The Remnant... a massacre.&quot; He muttered quietly, his joviality seemingly snuffed as he spoke,<br />&quot;I did not survive : Fire, and blood... An ocean of rust and dead harvest. A Corpse, a Glint, an Eater...&quot;<br /><br />Lekalis shuddered and his fingers wriggled, the sunny eye seemed to refocus,<br />&quot;... No, the Remnant died.

He scoffed with amusement at the subtle humor, a flash of a toothy smirk creaking past his lips before quickly dissipating into a faint curve.<br /><br />&quot;In the olden times of war and empires, perchance, we have crossed paths.&quot; He picked up on the prior topic, re-introducing himself as he closed the gap with the group. &quot;If it were, you must forgive me, for it escapes my memory too. And were it not the case, it would be a pleasure to make your acquaintance nonetheless.&quot; He offered a handshake, his palm turned slightly up to expose his arm. &quot;You may call me Lupin, if it would please you. And should your memory fail you, you will find no lack of kinship every time you were to pose that question.&quot; He added in an attempt to put the battle-worn Loki at ease.<br /><br />&quot;Either of you, that is.&quot; He said, extending the prior introduction to Muro, though their offer of a hand shake would have to wait.

His orange pupils correlating towards the steel-wall with perhaps festive decoration. Something ticked in his head vigorously, this tapping in the walls. It pecked slowly with a metaphorical finger inside, the sound like a finger repeatedly poking a chalkboard. <br /><br />||Wall||<br /><br />“In my head... in my head... in my head.” With each tap, those words repeated.

Nobody else could hear the tapping but him, it was slower now before.... a sharp scream was heard, a lot of screams and the sounds of fire coming from the wall; yet only Jay’lin saw this. <br /><br />||Jay’lin|| <br /><br />He was staring with bewilderment; obscure thought twisting his brain waves before he mumbled towards himself. “Not again...” as he’d use his powerful sense of mind to tell himself this was a hoax inside of his head; yet the void energy inside of him told them not. He begins to chant something in his head, <br /><br />“One, two... away, one, two... away...”  <br /><br />He’d begin saying in a whisper like voice as the banging and screaming got louder, before it all halted. His eyes widening as the sounds came to an absolute halt, he stared at his Komi board and realized he had lost; his breathing faster then usual as he’d simply close the Komi board up and begin to just slump in his seat, relaxing. Trying to cooperate from his mind playing tricks.

                            <b>Leithon:</b><br />The Tenno was just sat there in a barren corner of the room, watching everything happen. Every so often he would look behind him at his Mesa - whose colours were extremely similar to that of his own: onyx and a rusted orange. He preferred his loneliness, as social interactions (or interactions in general) never ended well for him or anyone involved in it.

And su--”<br /><br />Before he could finish, the elevator slid open again. This time instead of a Tenno, a white kavat with pale-blue highlights proudly stood at attention. In his mouth was some sort of cylindrical device that looked like one of the canisters on a gammacor.<br /><br />Disruptis’s gaze wiped around to rest on the feline. “Ah, just what I needed! Thanks Frost!”<br /><br />The kavat lumbered over to the Tenno’s open hand, his shoulder blades bulging out of his back with every step. Disruptis transferred back into his ‘frame and received the item.<br /><br />“You go ahead Elizabeth, I’ll join you in a sec,” he said, then flicked the synoid gammacor at his waist up into his arm. With a small click and a twist, he removed one of the three cylinders already on the weapon and popped in the new one. The gammacor gave a series of beeps at different pitches.

Or maybe it was just the oppritunity to get away from the loud, drunk party everyone else here was having.

It was enough to hold Lekalis&#39; attentions for a time to bow his brow in kind to the introductions.<br /><br />&quot;Lupin, Lupin : noble, fierce, yet friendly. A good name...&quot; He commented kindly as his good hand reached out to clasp Lupin&#39;s hand before pausing, the fingers twitched away and rested aside from the Operator&#39;s hand, while a familiar flicker and slumber settled over the Strider&#39;s form.<br />As before, a pale limb misted out from his Warframe; phantasmal in the staticky glow of its white skin. Albeit, it looked to be more... solid than before. The jade band about his wrist and elbow shone more apparently, and the red ribbon between them was markedly bold in its hue.<br /><br />Lekalis&#39; long fingers and slight extensions of limb were all the more apparent as his fingers curled delicately about Lupin&#39;s hand. Soft like silk, the digits had a density more like a porcelain doll than flesh and bone.<br />&quot;... The pleasure is mine, Lupin.&quot; He spoke at last as the hand, as delicate as it seemed, managed to shake Lupin&#39;s hand with grace and fluidity that inspired some soothe in Lupin&#39;s own skin. It was almost euphoric; acupuncture, somatic therapy, or herbal remedies all seemed so... pointless in the wake of the undeniable Vazarin sooth that flowed out from the Strider&#39;s hand.<br />[1/2]

He held them up to Leveret, which now took the Strider&#39;s attention to look at the comrade at his shoulder,<br />&quot;That would be wise, Leveret; take these beneath the window... take Kamos and Atela over as well : comrades, Ceres... You three have much to catch up on, I think.&quot;<br /><br />Just as long as the introduction seemed, The Strider&#39;s motions now had him moving on and towards Ella in no real haste as he kept his helm faced conversationally towards Lupin, should he follow still.

The fleeting sensation held his hand hostage for the briefest of moments, before it returned to its comforting hold with a mechanically smooth movement.<br /><br />His eyes had barely began to adapt to the delicate figure and the figure was gone. A flash desperation crossed them as they scoured the surface of the scarred warframe, yet the landslide quickly settled into stone-cold restraint.<br /><br />&quot;Where did you learn to make this tea, so rumored to enthrall people?&quot; He deviated the conversation to regain his stoic focus, as he followed Lekalis towards the unsuspecting Ella.

In the same stroke, his freed fingers plucked out a root and flower of Ruk&#39;s Klaw; both were set into the last cup and were crunched beneath his thumb. Ground to a paste and powder that still didn&#39;t stick to the Strider&#39;s thumb.<br /><br />&quot;I watched a Glint on the Red Sea. The way debris lingers : pecked by birds and scorched by sun upon the surface, fish beneath the waves, a return to sediment and soil.&quot; Lekalis waxed on poetically as he produced the iron canister yet again, in his prosthetic; the cap flicked off but was caught between to careful fingers before it fell. The tendons of the prosthetic limb moved with their own rigid grace, as they held the canister and poured it into the iron cup while Lekalis scarcely missed a beat in his stride towards Ella.<br />There was the barest sense of urgency noticeable in his longer steps, and in how he broke the simple speaking distance he&#39;d retained with Lupin t&#39;ill now.<br />&quot;The tea is easy. The people are... difficult.&quot; He added over his shoulder as he approached Ella, teacup in his palm with his thumb stirring it in fair haste.<br /><br />The Strider cast out a message as he neared Ella&#39;s flank,<br /><div class="pre pre--multilineLek">[Tea?]<br /></div><br />The brew had rapidly eskewed in colors white and green and now white again, with a subtle whorl of green to its nature. A familiar and sharp scent wafted away from the warming tea, a scent alike to dried mint leaves floating on milk.<br /><br />Lekalis turned halfly to Lupin  and motioned for him to keep a distance.

As Kapak turned to Disruptis a cyan mist enveloped the Tenno, his warframe suddenly replacing his body. Now as Ivara, he lifted the glass up to his visor and with a curious look eyed it. <br /><br />Then, out of nowhere he rotated 270 degrees and chucked the glass at insanely high speeds towards the Loki. It whooshed millimetres past his head an crashed into the wall, shattering into a million pieces, each one tiny as a grain of sand.<br /><br />Vuko then acted as if nothing had happened, and went over to Disruptis. With a voice full of anger, as if he was disturbed from his well deserved break, he asked with a sigh. “Why is <i>it</i> here? What went wrong again?”

Her azure, pony-tailed hair flew free of its night-blue cave, the beautiful auroric feather that had been peeking out now swaying upwards in victorious lift, her aurora colored eyes flashing wide in shock and surprise.<br /><br />The portion of the right half of her face was plated in a regal cybernetic implant, three progs, that of a winged symbol on what was to originally have beem here ear, now a circular plate coarse with her head, fanned out, as if detecting for predatory words, or simply, in surprise. The rest of her right face was twisted from some violent somatic link in her previous age, but, to save, the right was beautifully untouched.<br /><br />A cognitive relay lit up, small lights playing in pattern as Striker glided over to catch the now flashing PDA, wire still connected.<br /><br />Without a second thought, she covered her face with her hands, grasping behind her head at the night-blue hood, before successfully cowling it back over her face, nearly entirely this time in forzen panic.

He was about to walk over to him and ask him just what in the Void&#39;s name he was thinking, but watching him march over to Disruptis made him hesitate. Even without seeing him throw the glass, he had known Vuko long enough to tell something had upset him, though Muro wasn&#39;t quite sure what. Shaking his head for a moment, Muro strode towards Vuko and Disruptis, who seemed to be in the midst of an intense argument.<br /><br />&quot;Vuko, what&#39;s the deal? Something wrong?&quot;

Shield unwavering, Lupin beamed a stern gaze that demanded explanations at the culprit, but found their attention had already been drawn elsewhere.<br /><br />He would have to allow Muro to lead the questioning, however, as they seemed to have beat then to the initiative.<br /><br />&quot;Are you unharmed?&quot; He asked warmly at Ella, keeping comfortable distance while giving her a cautionary scan for glass ricochet

That mishap was my and XerAI’s bad for not giving good enough instructions; The team was just trying to hold down a sleepwalker. They had-- well…”<br /><br />The Limbo reconsidered his wording with a special doctor in mind. “<i>Most</i> didn’t know you were actually awake. Doc-- er… Frost was just doing his job. Look, can we all talk about this later? He was just here to deliver a gamma module to me. Plus, this is <i>something</i> that’s not really <i>easy</i> to <i>discuss</i> here.” Disruptis jabbed at Kapak’s gut with every emphasis, hoping everyone would get the hint to keep Frost’s identity a secret. None of the guests needed to know what an abnormality was, and hopefully none would find out. The fewer the better.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the icy kavat nearly jumped out of his fur when the glass was thrown, and was now slowly retreating back into the elevator with his head lowered. It seemed to want out of there, and fast.

A brief analitical pause anticipated his attempt to delicately guide the mechanical sensors with one hand, the other focused on locating and extracting the stranded saboteurs.<br /><br />Eyes shone brightly as he continued to channel the void, sending the sommatic scars that framed his face into a writhing frenzy that appeared to remain undetected by their host.

Every single one. <br /><br />The universe is very mysterious; It does a lot of unexplainable things. Matter of fact, that’s why the Response to the Unknown Corporation even was founded. Some things they can control, but their strength is still limited. An entire armada of Tenno bombarding one abnormality is much more powerful than everything /RU has to offer. Yet, they still must maintain secrecy in order to prevent anyone from creating things beyond their realm of knowledge. Those creations may backfire and throw the entire system into crisis. Then they’re <i>really</i> screwed.<br /><br />Case in point, now.<br /><br /><b><i>BOOOOOM!!!!!</i></b> The entire room shook with the ferocity of a nine-point-two magnitude earthquake. Glasses and teacups shattered in sprays of deadly shards. Warframes and Operators alike were thrown around like toy dolls. Food was both smeared all over the floor and sent careening up to the ceiling. The elevator’s base screeched in protest before under pressure, sending Dr. Frost to a quick demise. Even the walls warped and bent like the inside of a crushed Corpa-Cola can. In the center of it all, was a crack.<br /><br />Or rather: an orange gaping hole outlined in yellow that spanned the width of the entire ceiling.<br /><br />Inside its fiery vortex lay a flat event horizon, impossibly stretching to some unknown plane of reality not known to anyone in the universe. It yawned with unimaginable power and sent a deafening hissing sound through the ears of all Tenno.

These senses slowly coalesced into an awareness of air calmly caressing his tendriled hand, transforming into soothing aura emanating from Ella.<br /><br />Each glittered fragment seemed to shine on its own, as he watched his violet traces leading upon her mane, to be met with faint bright blue coils bridging at each little fragment plucked.<br /><br />For a moment, it was if he was seeing into her, as she to him...<br /><br />A flashing pair of gold and crimson orbs clashing,ramming into one another bodies, leaving sparkling fragments of themselves behind, then disappearing within a split second.<br /><br />An ire no longer prevalent, quiet, fickle fluxed with every discovering movement of Ella.<br /><br />A gloomy, blue moon, hiding away, outshined by a sanguine sun.<br /><br />Eventually, each bearing of their respective prong would come free of the shrapnel, flexing in unison, then folding, then unfolding back to its winged shape.

Summoning his crossbow before shooting at a nearby wall, quickly running towards it and grabbing onto the two objects with vigourous force. Yet a Komi board would fling towards him and knock him off balance: now holding only one. <br /><br />“Oh SCRAAAAAAAP!”

                            <b><i>Elizabeth</i></b><br />Having never mustered up the courage to join the conversations surrounding the tea, Elizabeth merely retreated into the sanctuary of her Trinity. Unperceived to all others, she kneel; within her gleaming conduit of metal and flesh, a lonesome girl closed shut her eyes; deep behind the masque of Life, an imagination slaved furiously to revive a dying heart. <i>She paid no heed to the world, and when the maelstrom of chaos came, she embraced with open arms the touch of her long-lost lover: the Storm itsel-..</i><br /><br />Interrupting her pensive posture was the first tremor; in the heartbeats afore the next, Elizabeth was all ready twisting into motion-- lithsome and neat, she evaded near-certain death and began flicking herself rapidly here and there without rhyme or reason. Seeking escape from inescapable plot devices, she was doomed from her arrival; and so it was, as the walls and floor shattered into shards, she zigged when she should have zagged ... <br /><br />... Ferrite tore through and savaged her noble frame, and she was pinned to the fast-disintegrating floor. Sinking to her knees, she kneel; <i>and with a smile on her sanguine lips, she embraced her long-lost lover: the Storm itself.</i> <br />Heralded by her final thoughts, the arrival of Elizabeth into the heavens was all together less momentous than she would have liked.

As the last shard was removed, he witnessed the wings of a bird of myth take form for a split second. His hands still didn&#39;t shy away from her, entangled by force or simply by will of their own.<br /><br />Gravity&#39;s lapse went undetected in the most crucial of moments, breaking the spell over Lupin and sending him flying across the room.<br /><br />&quot;What in the Void is-&quot; He was cut short as he collided mid-air with one of the tables, now devoid of their feasts and gifts. With a loud crash and crack, he felt his chrysalis shatter like glass, ribs snapping in half as the now jagged edge of the metallic furniture cut deep into his chest. He burst into a cloud of twilit fumes, his essence back safely within the metal casing.<br /><br />The until-then vacant warframe had, much to his dismay, already been propelled off the wall it had been resting against, and into the gaping maw that offered certain doom. No sandstorm, nor myriad of void-infused beetles could prevent this fate, and yet there was no lack of futile attempts by such methods.<br /><br />A sand cloud slowly drifted upwards.

                            <b>Muro:</b><br />The lack of explanation of Disruptis&#39; part was aggravating, to say the least. As more and more people joined their conversation, all of whom seemed to know a lot more about what was going on than he did. In this instance, however, he didn&#39;t have time to sulk. The explosion that rocked the room sent Muro flying back towards the wall, the durability of his Hydroid frame the only reason the shock didn&#39;t knock him unconscious. Immediately his eyes were drawn to the fiery rift that had appeared in the ceiling. Muro hadn&#39;t the slightest clue what it was, but his instincts told him one thing: RUN. <br /><br />&quot;Aurelia!&quot; he practically screamed into his comm link. &quot; Get the Liset to my location, now! Cut a hole into the station if you have to!&quot;  Her response was immediate.<br /><br /><b>Aurelia:</b><br />&quot;Already on its way, darling!&quot; Truly, it was in times of crisis where Muro and Aurelia worked best together. No sass, no time for jokes, just solid teamwork. In truth, the shock of the fissure opening up had completely fried the MOA proxy she had been using. Like her Operator, she had no idea what caused it, but one thing was clear: it was time to leave. Within moments the Liset was docked on the side of the station, a myriad of tools working at cutting through the thick outer walls of the station. &quot;Muro, its going to take me a moment to make an opening. Look for a hole along the eastern wall of the room!&quot;

Muro looked around the room at the various faces he knew in the room, his family amongst them. He couldn&#39;t lose them. Not again. Summoning up all the strength he could, he let out a yell that he could only hope would be heard above the roar of the rift. <br /><b>&quot;VUKO! KAPAK! LEKS! EVERYONE! GET TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE ROOM! NOW!&quot;</b> The panicked yell shook Muro to his core, though he wasn&#39;t sure it even reached the others.  All he could do now was pull himself towards the designated wall, hoping that Aurelia could breach the wall before the entire station came down on them.

The two knew what to do. They had spent countless hours preparing for almost every eventuality. This was no different. I mean, there was still a moment of panic as both were knocked off balance, but Atela managed to keep Kamos on his feet when he nearly tripped. Now holding onto the wall as things got worse and worse, Kamos glanced at the window and nodded to Atela.<br /><br />&quot;EVERYONE SHOULD HOLD ONTO SOMETHING!&quot; Kamos shouted, before... kicking the window into a bunch of tiny shards and exposing them to space. Immediately, the decompression launched the two of them out of the station. Just like Sedna, yep. Well, part of that mission. The both of them held onto each other, as Atela focused on making contact with their liset and getting their Archwings over here. At most, they had a few minutes before the life support on their frames failed, and they would be forced out of transference. Nope, they weren&#39;t losing their frames like this.

How did the Quill even drink his tea when he had that mask on all day?!<br />“Yes yes,” Onkko answered Disruptis before he could ask, “that... ‘vortex’ from that point on would have gained sufficient gravitational pull to end the known universe in less than one second.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br />Disruptis pondered for a moment, then let out a long sigh.<br /><br />“Fine, fine. I guess you win,” he conceded.<br /><br />He set down the earthen cup resting in his grasp and got up from his stool to pace. To be honest, Disruptis wasn’t exactly foreign to the idea that some of the events surrounding the corporation’s success weren’t coincidental. There’s no way he could easily pinpoint the Quills hand, but /RU did run into some very lucky circumstances which would’ve taken them in a separate path altogether had the outcome been different.<br /><br />“Well,” Disruptis finished, stopping in front of the doorway. A smile faltered on his lips. The Tenno wanted to ask something niche and light-hearted, like what his chances were at getting a girl. But, he couldn&#39;t. He knew what he truly wanted to ask, but he wanted to be serious about it. Some vague prophetic answer would’ve left a bitter taste. But… he needed to ask it. After all this time, he needed to know. Know that his life had direction.<br /><br />“Was it…” Disruptis hesitated, bringing his gaze up to the Quill&#39;s, “good… that the Orokin Remnant failed?”

                            <u>Onkko:</u><br />The Quill tilted his head at Disruptis.<br />“Ah. The Orokin ruin that fell from the sky, in several ways. Hmmm.”<br />Onkko turned away from Disruptis to set the Ostron drinking set onto a nearby table, brushing away several dusty Sentient Amp parts to make room.<br />“Perhaps. Well, since that future is no longer to be in this reality, I suppose there is no harm in clarifying some things. In one reality, Mataeru, your Dark Tenno leader seizes conteol of the System but at terrible cost. In another, your newfound family brings long lasting prosperity, peace and unity to the System. The Unum’s gift is sight, but not assurance. The tale that you write is your own, Tenno.”<br />Onkko waved his hands to the side as if to an invisible audience, before tossing Disruptis a small engraved disc of Auron. On it’s rounded face was the carving of a feathered quill.<br />“It is everyone’s tale to write. Now, I know for a fact in that head of yours you can’t help but wonder about a possible female companion in your own future, hmm?”<br />Onkko stood behind his counter and planted his hands in his hips.<br />“That is knowledge that you will discover for yourself. Now, begone! I have customers waiting and night is upon us! The Eidolons wait for no man!”<br />Onkko shooed Disruptis away.

                            <b>Disruptis:</b><br />Disruptis gave an amused laugh. “Of course you knew I was thinking that. I probably asked you in a different reality! Muck!”<br /><br />The Tenno flipped the coin over in his fingers, taking a moment to digest all he had heard. He pivoted in a circle with slow strides, his head now hunched over in more serious thought. After four turns, he leaned upon the mystical doorway one last time.<br /><br />“You’re right,” Disruptis said, bringing his face once again up to the starry night sky. The gentle wind and soothing rain fell reassuringly on his skin. Spurts of water erupted from impact with the raindrops, causing him to squint his eyes.<br /><br />“I think,” he clenched the auron disc, “I like things better this way. With the pen in our hands. No one has to write it alone, but no one gets to write it for you.”<br /><br />He stepped out with final closure resting on top of his heart, and the door cranked shut on a very peculiar reality.<br /><br /><b>[END RP]</b>
