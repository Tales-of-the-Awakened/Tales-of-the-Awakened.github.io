~A hollow cranking noise reverberated through the air and down into the Tenno
s’ own technocytic bones. The elevator grinded downwards, pulling them from the warm but sparse graces of the emergency lighting and plunging them into colder darkness. 

They descended for two minutes before the haunting drone of distant alarms could be heard from beneath. The elevator slowed, then cranked to a stop in the dark. 

Two large doors swung open in front of the Tenno, revealing a big room bathed in the pulsing red light of wall-mounted alarms. Four rows of consoles and other computer equipment dominated the room with a large hologram centered in the middle that displayed the yellow-orange projection of a typical Grineer soldier.

A single wide corridor led out of the room and around a bend to the rest of the floor.~</span>

The Excalibur stepped out first, sweeping his pistol along the field of view that the room offered, making his way to the most prominent set of consoles and kneeling down to plug in Karsk&#39;s datamass. Once that was completed, he turned back to his companions, drawing his blade with his now free hand and holding his ground.

&quot;I&#39;ll stay here until the Cephalon gets what he needs from this setup. If you want to go on ahead, we&#39;ll catch up as soon as we&#39;re done.&quot;</span>

In tow to his companion, the Inaros flowed out of the elevator, sidearm in hand as they secured the room, then moved towards the threshold of the corridor, watching as Dominus hacked into the rudimentary system.

&quot;I do not want to get another of those reinforced bulkheads separating us - we can move together once the Cephalon is done.&quot; He explained while taking stock of the ammo in his gun and reserve (though &#39;we&#39; was still not quite well defined).</span>

He found one and quickly dispatched it with a round from his grataka, then began to pace the room as the Cephalon worked its way inside the system.

They’ve performed all sorts of tests on them with the aim to learn of their nature enough to create things with it. Karsk found a holographic representation of their ambitions and threw it on the hologram in the center of the room.

The glowing orange image of a Grineer soldier sprang into view, though something was off about him. His right arm and legs were made with assimilated Sentient material. A large cannon was fashioned onto his right arm, providing him with a wicked looking arsenal.

The Excalibur quickly extracted the Cephalon&#39;s datamass, staring at the hologram as he did so. He felt more than heard Intellectus taking pictures of the amalgamation through his optics, but after a moment of mentally processing just what it was he was looking at, Max got his senses back in order.

&quot;Grineer are overstepping the bounds of sanity. We need to move fast and brick this place as much as possible. Where&#39;s the next floor? Let&#39;s get under way, and then we can destroy everything on our way back out, if we can&#39;t find some other form of self-destruction.&quot;</span>

&quot;If only they could be this creative about anything other than war.&quot; The defeat in his voice rang clear as he clicked the clip back into the gun and readied it for combat. &quot;And the last thing this system needs is another faction wilfully puppeteered by Sentients.&quot;

The holographic Grineer blurred, then cleared, becoming an image of an old, bearded main with a unibrow and a receding hairline, wearing a loincloth.

&quot;Yep,&quot; he said.  &quot;I can show it on the hologram here, or you can log in to any terminal and see it.  I&#39;ve got all the security open for you.

&quot;Hologram is fine for the layout, Intellectus can scan it and assist with navigation on my end. If anyone else needs the map we can share it as well. We&#39;ll get you into that terminal too.&quot;</span>

<strong>Hydroid:</strong>
With the room appearing clear of any prying eyes, the Hydroid turned his attention to the abomination of a grineer that was on display. 

&quot;Idiots,&quot; he snorted. &quot;About what I&#39;d expect from the Grineer&#39;s best and brightest though.&quot; 

Striding towards the nearest console, he accessed the map being offered, taking careful note of the general layout of this floor. 

&quot;Glad to hear we&#39;re all on the same page now,&quot; he remarked, &quot;we stick with the first part of my plan: search this place from top to bottom, one floor at a time, and kill everything we find. Once we&#39;ve done that, we wreck everything else on the way back up. Cephalon, see if you can lock down the elevator while we clean this floor out. I don&#39;t want anything escaping from this place.&quot;</span>

&quot;Agreed.&quot; He nodded, glancing over the map hologram from afar. &quot;Though we should consider a full reactor collapse on our way out, let everything burn and be swallowed up by the oceans.&quot;

&quot;We will have to check for critical locations on our way down.&quot; He was holding by the threshold, back turned to the room after finishing the quick inspection, waiting to move out. &quot;Ready when you are.&quot;</span>

&quot;No, no, consider the ecological consequences.  Collapsing the facility would release its contents into the ocean.&quot;

The hologram displayed an animation of the local ocean currents, from the initial survey that had preceded the base&#39;s construction.

&quot;Machine oil is bad enough.  There&#39;s also the fuel for the reactor, whatever noxious juices they use for decontamination, and how sure are we that the Sentient bits are fully dead?&quot;</span>

&quot;I&#39;m not concerned about the effects of most of that list considering that this is a planetary ocean larger than Earth roughly 57 times over. But the Sentient parts, yes, those are too much of a threat to risk letting into any ecosystem. We eliminate all Sentient presence in this facility, destroy any and all data and machinery related to the production of these new clone designs, and then we get out. Without their actual end goal as an option, the Grineer will scrub the operation and either detonate it themselves or repurpose it. Either way, our job will be done.&quot;

A ping from Intellectus told him that the copying of the map layout was completed. The Excalibur turned to his fellow Tenno and locked view with each of them. &quot;Any complaints, voice them now. We&#39;ve got another floor to go, and I&#39;m starting to suspect we&#39;re drawing attention to ourselves. Another Grineer ship could&#39;ve arrived by now and is moving in behind us as we speak.&quot;</span>

&quot;You want to talk &#39;ecological consequences&#39;?&quot; He growled, &quot;think about what happens if any of the stuff here manages to get into Grineer hands. I&#39;m going to stop that from happening, and if that means some fish die to make it happen, I can live with that.&quot; 

He paced away from the console, joining the other Tenno. 

&quot;No complaints here. Let&#39;s go see if these freaks are bulletproof.&quot;</span>

&quot;No time to lose, then. Right this way.&quot; He said, in a mimicry of an attendant&#39;s tone, although his voice made it sound more like a run down dinner than a fancy hotel. With a small nod in the direction of the hallway he led the way deeper into the facility, gradually accelerating into a fast, yet controlled jog, gun and knife at the ready.</span>

Red alarm lights throughout the level were already flashing, with some rooms featuring the haunting sound of a low-pitched siren permeating the air.

Eventually they opened a set of heavy double doors to the very large room labelled “Completed Prototypes” on their map. There in the low crimson light sat rows upon rows of hybrids slumbering inside cloning vats. There must’ve been at least two hundred of them in this room alone.~</span>

&quot;I have the scans covered, start looking for the vat control terminal, should be able to expunge them all at once.&quot; He said, reaching back for the small camera-like device on his back and immediately stating to scan the first hybrid.

&quot;Can you access my files from there, Karsk?&quot; He asked as the scan hit the midway point. &quot;I would like to have these things&#39; weaknesses analyzed before we run into an army of this size or worse.&quot;</span>

&quot;Looking for the terminal now. Lupin should be able to connect the scans to you from there, Karsk.&quot;

The Excalibur walks down the rows of tubes at a brisk pace, keeping his sidearm raised, just in case one of these hybrids got it into their heads to suddenly come to life and break free for a fight. He kept his eyes peeled for the vat control system as he went, suspecting it to either be on the far side of the rows, or in a central location.

&quot;Hydroid, keep watch for patrols, if you would. It&#39;s probably going to get even louder once we start purging these things.&quot;</span>

The Hydroid stalked between the rows of &quot;prototypes&quot;, keeping rather quiet as the cephalon and the other Tenno conversed. His hand flexed around the handle of his zaw, as if readying to swing at the first tank that caught his baleful gaze. Dominus&#39; request seemed to wrench his attention away for a moment. 

&quot;Gladly,&quot; he rasped, seeming almost excited by that prospect, &quot;are you sure you want to leave the destruction of these... things to that lab computer? We should handle this personally, really make sure there&#39;s nothing left. Besides, I doubt that machine would be able to snuff out the Sentient bits of them anyway.&quot;</span>

The merging of the two types of organisms was rough and scarred near their transition points with misaligned features. The scan didn’t take long.

Dominus walked between tubes of sleeping Frakensteinian monsters, ears filled with the cacophony of their bubbling liquids. The low light levels and flashing red alarms on the illuminated silhouettes of the creatures. Some held saws in place of hands, some had large antenna protruding from their shoulders, and some had been relieved of their legs. At the end of one of the rows was a large mechanical panel that held knobs and levers galore. In its center sat a flashing red monitor with four words on it: Critical Warning: Evacuate Facility.

At that very moment, a single <em>BANG</em> rang from the floor near Lupin’s feet. A few seconds of silence followed.

<em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> 

<em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em> <em>BANG!</em>

Soon, a number of loud banging noises erupted from beneath the Tenno. The floor around the area visibly shook with each hit.~</span>

The Excalibur inspected the panel closely, trying to determine exactly which apparatuses controlled what. He knew full well that evacuating the facility was a good idea, but Tenno didn&#39;t exactly thrive on logical thinking, most days.

Then the clanging sounds. He swung his weapon, and his gaze, across the room, trying to isolate exactly where the sounds were emanating from, and put distance between himself and them. Whatever might be trying to break through wasn&#39;t going to do it right from under his feet. Still, he had to keep close to the panel, in case one of the controls was what they needed to flush the whole place.

&quot;Karsk! Can you see anything? Where the hell is that coming from? And what am I hitting to shut down this operation?&quot;</span>

&quot;What the-?&quot; He whispered after the very first bang, crouching on the spot to put a hand against the floor. Then the second and third bangs reverberated through his hand and feet, threatening to throw him off balance.

&quot;Move!&quot; He shouted just as much to himself as for everyone else, as he regained his momentum and dashed away from the epicentre of the strikes. &quot;Breach imminent on my six.&quot; He added, already mid stride as he attempted to tag the map for the others.</span>

Black fluid began pouring down each of the vats, mixing with the sickly green vat juice to create a horrible concoction.

A final <em>BANG</em> from below warped the floor upwards. A moment of silence passed.

Then a new, high-pitched ringing sounded. A thin red laser pierced through the now small hill of dented ferrite. It swept across the deformation in a circle it connected on the other side, cutting the metal shape out, which was then yanked downwards with a screech.

A large cyan orb emerged from the hole, firing omnidirectional lasers in every direction. It smashed the glass of the nearby tubes, heated orange lines of ferrite floor, and scorched Lupin’s sword-steel chassis.

Following just beneath it was a single battalyst, but for some reason it was free to move around while channeling its omnidirectional orb. Locking on to the nearest target, it levelled one of its tuning-fork arms to Lupin. Sparks of purple sentient energy danced between the prongs as it charged an attack.~</span>

&quot;Son of a kubrodon!&quot; He snapped as the interface informed him of the sights placed on him, though he was already well aware given the searing sensation on his back.  &quot;No cordiality it is.&quot; He added as he raised his gun and aimed.

<em>KATHUNK-THUNK</em> - Two shots of his pyrana were aimed in the general direction of the battalyst&#39;s prongs, though the second was essentially a blind shot as he&#39;d resumed his run - away from the enemy and towards cover.

<em>&quot;Reposition while this thing is after me. Double time.&quot;</em> He barked over comms, ready to use his parazon to perform an emergency turn-slide to delay the impending laser galore from catching him.</span>

Max sensed more than felt the cold sweat break out, as he looked towards the battalyst emerge from the lower floor, as it shot its lasers all over. Lupin was already drawing its fire, so if he just got his Latron and sent off a shot, he could-

<em>Draw your sword.</em>

Something from his memories. Fighting Sentients had never been one of his strong suits, but for some reason...don&#39;t think about it right now. He flung himself from the console, tracking the Sentient even as he bulletjumped closer to it, angling between the tubes and sliding to close the gap. As soon as the range allowed, he would do the only sensible thing against a creature that hated the Void.

He would clap his Warframe&#39;s hands, and draw a blade made entirely of Void energy. Slashing the air, he would send a sword beam towards the Sentient, aiming to do some damage and disorient it until he could close to melee.</span>

The Hydroid leapt backward as the monstrosity crashed into the room, the Grakata in his hand roaring with a constant stream of lead. Standing in the open, the Hydroid quickly slid his zaw back into its holster, a small torrent of void-infused water beginning to pulse in his free hand. 

&quot;What the hell is this thing!?&quot; He barked at the other two Tenno.

~Bits of Pyrana shrapnel and Grakata bullets shredded the battalyst’s shield as it launched an energy orb straight into Lupin’s back as he ran. The moment after, Dominus’s energy slash slammed into it from the back, forcing it to lurch forward. Small wisps of smoke rose out of the new blackened streak across its back. The battalyst swivelled its head to face him with a robotic expression.

The omni directional lasers ceased as the entire body of the sentient flickered until it was covered in black and blue light. It locked two arms on Dominus and glided through the air, physically passing through the wreckage of Grineer-hybrid containers like a ghost and rising higher into the air. Purple energy sparked along both arms.

At the same time, two conculysts burst through the hole and scanned their environment. Their sensors locked on to the Tenno in the room.~</span>

The Excalibur drew himself into a parrying stance, ready to intercept whatever the battalyst threw at him as he began charging. If it hesitated to attack, or looked elsewhere, he would send another sword beam at it. If he could close the distance, he&#39;d once again bulletjump, trying to carve a swathe through its chassis and end things quickly. That purple energy was...familiar. Dangerously familiar. As he went on the offensive, he called out to the others.

&quot;These are Sentients. Enemies of the Old War, that almost wiped out the entire system. They adapt to your attacks, so you&#39;ll need to mix it up. I have piercing with my Latron, radiation from my kitgun, and obviously my sword. My Exalted Blade also <em>should</em> disrupt their adaptation since it uses Void energy. But for all we know that might be what the Grineer were hybridizing them against. In which case, we need to kill everything here.&quot;</span>

A loud vocalised hiss was sent through the comms, as the feedback of the hit cut him off before he could speak. His parazon anchored him off from sliding and tumbling out of control, but it was far from a smooth manoeuvre. Controlling the end of his spin, he raised the pistol-shotgun back towards the energised battalyst, only to find it charging <em>away</em> from him.

&quot;And luckily for us, they mostly kept archaic designs. Just aim for the head, but-&quot; He added at the end of Dominus&#39; explanation, stopping only at the notice of the two new contenders. &quot;-but be careful: they rarely are alone.&quot; He finished amidst bullet jumping behind machinery and sliding to a stop to reload the gun.</span>

&quot;Tenno,&quot; said the scratchy voice from the intercom, &quot;Why don&#39;t you use your Void beams?&quot;  He was annoyed.  They were being idiots.  &quot;We know that is the way to  fight Sentients.&quot;  They were also risking his life, sort of.

The Sentients, if left active, would interface with the base&#39;s computer and consume him, or at least, this instance of him.  They would gain knowledge of the inner workings of his mind, which would make it harder for him to fight them if he ever had to, and also creeped him out.

Meanwhile, he would awaken from his backup on Narakis&#39;s ship, with no memory of what had happened since he&#39;d loaded himself into the datamass to come down from orbit.  That would be back to square one for this mission, an annoyingly restrictive obligation that he wanted over with.

Needless to say, he wanted to avoid this, but there was nothing he could do except hope that the Tenno heeded his advice.  Considering the average Tenno&#39;s track record, Karsk was not optimistic.</span>

The conculysts both turned black-and-blue similar to the battalyst and rushed their opponents. One phased through the machinery Lupin was hiding behind with ease, dropped the blue energy, and brought both of its limbs down onto him. The other one flew over to the Hydroid and did the same.

After this, two more battalysts and two conculysts poured from the floor shrilling in their characteristic humming noises.~

~Karsk’s body awoke to the sound of waves.

He sat up to find himself on a large Grineer sealab landing platform. Rain and sea mist pelted his chassis as he looked around to see Grineer corpses were littered everywhere. Some had fresh blood and some held blood much staler. A heaping wreck of a ship was jammed into the front of the entrance to the sealab and another sat to his right. Nothing moved other than the wind, the waves, and the rain.~</span>

&quot;Fu-&quot; He coughed out into comms in the split second before the unexpected concussive blow pinned him to ground. A loud thud accompanied his hard crash into the ground. It was at times like this that he was truly thankful for the sheer capacity of his host to take such brutal beatings.

&quot;That is definitely new.&quot; He spat out as he struggled to twist his body around and kicked off the now useless cover to slide away on his back, emptying the freshly loaded magazine into the point-blank conculyst. If they planned on taking these things head-on he needed to know if they even were taking any damage at all.

&quot;More incoming!&quot; He called out on comms once again as soon as the three new threats came into view.</span>

Where was he?  He&#39;d never been here before.

He remembered...  He remembered he&#39;d been on a mission to infiltrate a Grineer base, with a Tenno who used Nova.  He remembered why the base was important, he remembered their plan.  He remembered making a backup on his moa, and that he&#39;d been about to load himself into a datamass.

Now here he was, no datamass, no Tenno, sitting at the entrance to a Grineer base.  Hopefully it was the right one.  How had his body gotten here, anyway?  That wasn&#39;t part of the plan.

Probably, the mission had gone wrong, the datamass was destroyed, and he&#39;d reloaded from a backup.  That would explain the gap in his memory.  Karsk hated when things like this happened.  Unnatural.  Sometimes he wished he could just die normally, but there was just too much going on, so much interesting to watch, so much bumbling to make fun of.  Except when he had to reload a backup.  It meant he&#39;d missed something important.  It also meant that this time, the bumble was his, and even though he always eventually managed to get over it, even though he told himself to accept his mistakes and be humble and learn, he still hated it.

He picked his way carefully toward the crashed ship, looking around and listening for anything that moved, listening for any comms signals that might be flying past, anything that could give a clue as to where he was or how he&#39;d gotten there.</span>

Karsk was right, obviously, but using his Operator&#39;s pure Void abilities was...difficult, for him. But the Cephalon and the others had no way of knowing that. He kept tracking the Tau orbs as he closed the gap with the original battalyst, and at the last second attempted to roll clear of them, and underneath its floating chassis in the same movement, drawing his kitgun to fire up at the Sentient with several thumps of irradiated blasts.

&quot;Lupin, I don&#39;t suppose you have an amp you could use if we gave you cover, do you?&quot;

He noticed the additional contacts swarming through the hole they&#39;d made. This was bad. <em>Really</em> bad. He sent a request to Intellectus, for the Cephalon to send out a distress signal to any other potential Tenno in their region of space. If the Sentients were this numerous in some secret Grineer base, it was becoming all of their problems.</span>

One of the battalyst reinforcements hovered around the room in phasing form and charged two orbs at him from the back.

Two more orbs slammed into the floor next to Dominus as he rolled forward. His kitgun blasted three shots of his kitgun, depleting the shields of his battalyst and then some. Before Dominus could get any more damage in, the sentient brought up its intangible form once again. The fourth shot flew straight through it.

The Hydroid grabbed the blunt-headed Zaw on his back and cracked it down on the head of the first Conculyst.

Just when he thought weapons were proving a bit too effective, the sentient reinstated his fears as they displayed their phasing capabilities. He seen vomvalysts capable of de-phasing, but those were built with that capacity in mind, and their lower mass and volume was no coincidence in that matter, not to mention non of them possessed something the accuracy and reaction time the current threat flaunted.

With no room to spare, he rolled to his side, narrowly dodging the sentient&#39;s baton-arm, and springing onto his feet gauging the distance to the now two sentient near him.

<em>&quot;If their ability is anything like a vomvalysts then maybe...&quot;</em> He thought as he focused his sights on the phased battalyst charging the next volley. Either way, it was best to cut them off than continue on the defence. He lowered his centre of mass and broke into a bullet jump towards the battalyst, contorting his frame mid-air as he begun the disk-throwing motion that his Tenno body completed as it materialised out its back.

In his true body, now devoid of the Grineer disguise from earlier, Lupin seemed far too frail for the prospect of the current combat. A skin-tight bulletproof vest was all that remained to protect him, and that would pose little resistance against the Sentients. Still, his light frame contorted to put every bit of strength to throw a void energy disk - its lilac glow quickly tinting his pale-gold skin, while the red highlights in his otherwise raven hair gained a new intensity in the light.</span>

Intangibility. Lovely. Still, he was having an effect, if the Sentient felt it necessary to use that ability at all. He made a brief visual sweep of the larger battlefield, spotting the newly approaching conculyst, and more importantly, the pressure the Hydroid was starting to face.

Max glanced back at his foes, and without a word, tore off at an angle, firing off rounds from his kitgun at the backs of the Hydroid&#39;s enemies, in an attempt to try and leave an opening for him as he made distance with his own targets.

&quot;I&#39;d recommend you do some of that famous crowd control your frame is renowned for, friend. We&#39;re already underwater, the depths would be a mighty fine ally right now.&quot;

If push came to shove, he might be able to use <em>that</em> to do something. But he didn&#39;t know if he really had the capacity to channel that much energy. With any luck, they could start dismantling these enemies sooner rather than later.

No response from Intellectus&#39;s distress beacon yet, either. This was getting very bad.</span>

Nothing moved.  Obviously, a group of Tenno had come by here recently.  What else would cause such carnage?  Anyway, they seemed to be gone now.

There was something...  A signal from below.  A distress signal.  Tenno.  Interesting.  The Tenno were still here, and apparently over their heads in whatever was down there.

Karsk responded to the ping with an open communications channel.

<strong>Base Karsk:</strong>
The datascape here was sparse, an open plain of yellow gridlines, dotted with consoles.  Defenceless.  Karsk had gotten in here easily, and for the Sentients, once they were finished with the Tenno, it would be even easier.

Of course, then they would have to deal with him.  He couldn&#39;t defeat them but maybe he could hold them off long enough for someone to plug in a datamass and give him a chance to escape.

He glanced at one of the consoles, seeing through a security camera into the lab with the attacking Sentients.  The Tenno were giving no sign of transference.  One had even mentioned that these Sentients might be like vomvalysts.  So... where was the famous Tenno reaction time?  What were they doing?

He stood tall, and began to crack his joints.  Virtually, at least.  A final check of himself.  Then he began to dance, populating the yellow grid with patterns of shifting data, life of sorts, to confuse and overwhelm, at least for a while.</span>

The attack seemed to do no more damage in its phased form than if it hit a standard battalyst in the same way.

Dominus’s kitgun shredded the back of the first conculyst, forcing it to phase out and reposition behind the Hydroid. The other conculyst Dominus was previously fighting took the opening to rush over him like a whirlwind, slamming into him and knocking him to the ground.~</span>

He shifted into his water form and surged across the room, dragging his two assailants with him and into the wall on the opposite side of the room. It certainly didn’t kill them, but it gave him a little breathing room.

At least, as long as there was only one.

The Tenno heard more screeching coming from the hole. Eight more battalysts erupted from its depths, scanning the situation. Four of them charged lasers in their left arms and lined up side by side, facing the action. Karsk felt the other four join the cyberspace and begin fighting against the maze with their comrade, to which they began making ground.~</span>

&quot;Void energy still works against their phasing.&quot; He informed the others over comms, readying another charge from his amp, but it might as well have been a strongly worded complaint given the rate at which reinforcements seemed to join the fray.

&quot;There are too many to fight them head on!&quot; He let loose a second energy disk at the battalist before dashing to re-merge with the Inaros. &quot;We need a different approach.&quot; He continued, rolling over and vaulting onto his feet.

&quot;Noted. I&#39;d use an amp, but...&quot; The Excalibur had tucked and rolled with the impact from the conculyst that had struck him, setting his feet and rushing back into it with an upward vertical cut from his maintained Exalted Blade. He wasn&#39;t certain how much longer he could keep it running, but for now it was his best option to actually give off some damage.

&quot;Karsk! Are you still online? I notice a couple of these things are going dark, I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re entering the system. We can get you out if you&#39;re becoming overwhelmed. If we can&#39;t cut off the source, we may have no other choice but to bug out for now and get help. This is way too many without the right equipment.&quot;

He glanced over at the currently unoccupied datamass still sitting by the first terminals they found in the room. It would be a bit of a feat to bounce over there with all of the chaos unfolding around them.</span>

The five sentient fragments battled their way through the datascape, changing their goal from the turrets straight to Karsk himself. They now rapidly pushed their way through his maze towards him.

The conculyst brought up its phasing form to attempt to avoid the attack, but it didn’t matter. Dominus’s exalted blade pulled it up in the air a little further as it cleaved the sentient fragment through its midsection, destroying it.

The battalyst took Lupin’s second disc to the back, then swirled around and started to charge an arm, only to quickly halt it. The remaining sentients engaged in combat flew up to the ceiling synchronously, just before the four battalysts standing at the back released streams of yellow sentient energy from their arms.

As the machines entered the room, a veritable forest of tentacles shot up from the floor, each greedily grasping for the newly arrived Sentients. One after another they found their mark, and began to thrash about the room, violently slamming their captives into the floor and ceiling. It was a start, but he knew it wouldn&#39;t hold them for long.

&quot;I&#39;ll hold &#39;em here!&quot; He barked at the other Tenno as he began charging up a Tempest Barrage for the nearer five.  &quot;Just focus on one of them at a time!&quot; 
He loosed his attack, a downpour of acidic missiles raining down on the Sentients that Lupin and Dominus were currently fighting. They slammed onto them in their phasing forms and crippled one of them near Dominus.

The Excalibur pushed past the downed conculyst, attempting to deflect as much of the beams with his blade as possible to ablate the damage. He bounded through the forest of tubes to reach the datamass, linking it with the terminal and opening a route for Karsk to escape. Meanwhile, he dispersed the Exalted Blade and took up the Thumper again, trying to maintain cover fire for his squad.

Dominus&#39;s Cephalon supervised his master&#39;s efforts, fretting and attempting to keep his strategic overlay updated, until he heard a transmission from the top of the facility. It sounded...like his associate currently in the systems already?

&quot;Hm? Is that you, Cephalon Karsk? Whatever are you doing in a Moa? How did you get there from inside the facility? Well, nothing for it, the squad inside are struggling to contain the Sentient threat. Is there anyone up there with you?&quot;</span>

His sprint to the hole had been somewhat staggered due to the odd stray laser catching him from an unseen angle, causing him to stagger and vault to avoid yet another strike.

&quot;On it, but I do not think any amount of focusing will solve this issue.&quot; He replied to the Hydroid, then changed directions, charging towards the nearest held fragment, hoping the energy beast&#39;s tendrils would last long enough to secure him a point-blank shot at the thing&#39;s core. &quot;The hole is crawling with them, another wake incoming quick. We need to shut down the main shard or this will go on forever.&quot;</span>

Karsk ran.  He could not fight Sentients.  There was nothing to do but flee, flee for the datamass.  Lines of gliders twitched behind him, marching across the grid, leaving chaotic growths and sparks where they collided.  Hopefully it would be enough.  Hopefully it would delay them long enough for Dominus to...

<span class="pre pre--inline">Pull it.</span>

It was a simple text-only message, sent to Dominus&#39;s comms from the datamass.

<strong>Surface Karsk:</strong>
He answered Intellectus:

Lupin caught similar sear marks across his torso. The four reinforcements charge orbs in both arms. The datascape-bound sentients greedily tore through gliders, spaceships, and blinkers. The myriad of lights kept ascending through the hole in the floor.

Then the door the Tenno had come from flew open, revealing a black and yellow-coloured Limbo with a salix syandana weidling a synoid gammacor in front of him.

The Limbo barely took in the sight for half a second before brandishing a staggering amount of Rift energy in each hand with a sweeping motion. He pooled the energy together to form a swirling ball and threw it in the center of the room. Everyone in the room was washed in purple light as a Cataclysm expanded and they were sent into the Rift.

At the end of his throw, the Limbo twirled around and swept both his hands across the room in a gripping gesture, slowing relative time for the warframes by half and freezing everything else in place.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong>
“WHAT… in the MUCK is happening in here!” the Limbo hollered.</span>

The spores on it popped, spreading them to nearby sentients as she began taking aim at the next one, taking her time to not waste a shot since the Limbo had been so kind as to freeze them in place and apparently already put her into the Rift.</span>

Finally, just behind the limbo and Saryn, a gunmetal and green trimmed vauban stepped into the rift, causally dropping an overdriver at the groups feet with an energetic thud once he saw the Saryn draw her rifle.

The beams burned into his back and threw him to the ground right as the Excalibur pulled the datamass containing Karsk from the terminal. As the Cataclysm engulfed him, he slowly pushed to his feet.

&quot;What you&#39;re seeing, is a Grineer facility that was presumably experimenting with Sentients, and it went horribly out of control. The three of us weren&#39;t exactly equipped for a fight like this, but we&#39;ve been trying to contain it. My Cephalon, Intellectus, sent out a distress beacon on Tenno frequencies. Were you responding to that?&quot;

He then gestures with the datamass, taking the opportunity of slowed time to reload his weapons. &quot;We also had a particularly bold independent Cephalon join us for the mission to help out with acquiring data on the proceedings here. His name is Karsk. My callsign is Dominus, by the way.&quot;

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

The servile Cephalon quietly attempted to open a video link with Moa-Karsk, to share what he was now seeing inside the facility through Max&#39;s neuroptics. &quot;How curious...my Master has just pulled a datamass containing a shard of you from the facility&#39;s systems. You had initially been infiltrating the base alongside a Nova tasked with helping you to study the goings-on, as I&#39;ve come to understand. She was called to another mission, and so you were given over to my Master and his companion. Does your failsafe activate in the event that your signal is cut off?&quot;</span>

While fire and metal usually weren&#39;t much of a problem to recover from for the kingly frame, the former had always been one of the most unnerving sensations to share even when dulled by the void - searing beams were far from being an exception. His movements slowed down as he was midway into springing back and away from the sentient, covering the now seared portion of his torso.

&quot;Impeccable timing.&quot; He congratulated the Limbo as he took a moment of the reprieve to reload the pistol and pick the next target.

&quot;Lupin here - and as Dominus said: the sentient threat is far more numerous and active than we expected.&quot; The frustration in his voice was clear, though the intensity was channelled back into the killing at hand, it was evident this was an unforgivable kind of oversight in planning. &quot;Care to join in?&quot;</span>

~The Saryn began shredding sentients, taking two out in quick succession. After a couple seconds, all the sentients in the room and in the datascape began to make very slow movements again.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
“Yes!” The limbo replied, hands still outstretched and grasping at the fabric of time within his bubble of Rift. He shifted his focus so that Dominus, Lupin, and the Hydroid returned to the normal flow of time.

He refrained from putting the datamass back inside the system, noticing that everything was beginning to resume its movement. Better he didn&#39;t send a Cephalon off to die.

&quot;From what we can tell, they&#39;re pouring out of that hole, somewhere near the bottom.&quot;

Dominus too took advantage of the time dilation to once again draw his Exalted Blade and begin summarily executing Sentients by pushing the Void-stuff sword into their cores, hoping to literally cut down their numbers before they actually made a push for the origin point.

&quot;We&#39;ve been getting a bit thrown around, as you can tell, so I&#39;d rather we run cover and support for you, since your team is still fresh.&quot;

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

&quot;A Limbo and some additional forces have joined the fight, it would seem. Time dilation is slightly disrupting communications, but I will send for my Master to do something about your split situation as soon as possible. It may not be until they exterminate the Sentient threat, as the base systems are a bit compromised. In the meantime, do you have transportation? Or will you be needing a ride off planet for today?&quot;

A Cephalon that preferred to not use active shards. How fascinating!</span>

With the normal flow of time restored, and now with extra firepower at his back, the Hydroid holstered his shotgun, turning his full attention to keeping their foes at bay. He called one caustic volley of water down after another, targeting every visible group of Sentients, including those that were still in the clutches of his summoned companion. To the other Tenno, it would have almost seemed as if they were caught in the middle of a torrential downpour.

&quot;Hurry up and finish them!&quot; he gasped over comms as the rain thundered around them. &quot;I can hold them, but I don&#39;t know for how long!&quot;

~The group of Tenno began to make short work of a lot of the frozen sentients. They were shattered, sliced, and corroded under the barrage of their attacks with very little speed to adapt to the attacks with. Half of them managed to switch to their phasing forms just before becoming next on the chain, but even though they did every physical bullet was still damaging their chassis! Something had changed.

By the time they had finished adapting to the Rift, all of them but the ones still held in the Void Kraken’s tentacles were destroyed. Their corpses floated in mid-air, suspended in time as they lost their ability to function.~</span>

The Limbo saw the sentients finish adaptation and collapsed his swirling Cataclysm. He shifted the flow of the Rift energy coursing through his warframe and ripped another hole in the fabric of reality, changing up his Rift signature. The sentients froze again, though they would be moving a lot sooner this time.

The Limbo approached the hole slowly, keeping his focus on freezing the time around him. Once he reached it, he glanced down to see a myriad of shiny lights making their way towards him, and Lupin firing on one just before it started phasing again. The Limbo’s Cataclysm only extended slightly below the floor, catching two brachiolysts as they attempted to enter the room.
The Limbo’s mind ran at a rapid pace, piecing together dozens of possibilities to deal with this situation. Most of them weren’t going to work against sentients.

“Everyone split up and either blast the ones still here or send some bullets down this hole. We’re gonna need to just keep fighting through them.”</span>

&quot;On it, I&#39;ve got the ammo to spare. Suppressing.&quot; The Excalibur dispersed his Blade once again, unholstering the Latron from his back and jogging up next to the Limbo currently saving his and the rest of his impromptu strike team&#39;s asses. He began sending fire down into the hole, focusing on destroying the two captured brachiolysts first before adjusting his aim to the rest of the inbound lights. With each shot, the datamass on the opposite hip from his real sword jostled, reminding him of the cargo.

&quot;I&#39;d like to also get the Cephalon out of here sooner rather than later, if at all possible. Anyone interested in making a dash for the surface to drop this off with my LC? If I can get the word out to my own Cephalon, he might be able to get us a capsule for repairs and/or energy for us to use too.&quot;

Angstrum rockets, buckshot, and Tesla nervos swarmed towards the sentient combatants, the Vauban clearly fixed on doing as much damage as physically possible. That’s when he heard the Excalibur call out.
“If no one else can evac your cephalon, the path we took to get in should still serve as a viable egress point. We’ll make sure to cover you.”
With that, and another round from his angstrum, the Vauban called to the rest of the group. 
“If the rest of you have amps, I think now is the time for us to use them!” He said, refreshing his overdriver, and taking aim once again at the sentients ahead, keeping a knelt footing for what was to come next.</span>

With the rest of the impromptu crew coming to the rescue and now joining him at the void-ridden hell gate, he could finally take a moment to reassess the situation somewhat more calmly.

&quot;I can take the data mass back topside, taking their entry route.&quot; He said as he reloaded in tandem with the next wave of suppressing fire. &quot;Need to get some additional firepower dropped.&quot; He added just in time to switch back to emptying another clip of the Pyrana into the hole.

This is a good choke point, so if we have the ammo and power to spare we can keep trying to chew through them until it looks like there’s too many, then we retreat.”

The Excalibur wastes no time in lifting the datamass off of his hip and passing it to Lupin, resuming fire almost immediately as he hands it off. A ping finally makes its way through the time dilation, and he side-eyes the message, skims it, and speaks up.

&quot;While you&#39;re up there, another supply drop will come in from my Cephalon when he picks up Karsk. He&#39;s handing off my Carrier drone. Grab it and bring it with you, please. Also, just got a feed from Intellectus saying that a backup shard of him is currently sitting there in a Moa, activated after the Sentients got too close for comfort. They should be able to reunite, and I&#39;ll take him onboard my Orbiter for safety.&quot;

Karsk&#39;s comments gave Max a moment&#39;s pause, and with a sigh, he responded to him.

&quot;I...have an amp. I just haven&#39;t used it. I&#39;m not good with them, but we don&#39;t have much choice. After this clip, I&#39;ll Transfer back out.&quot; He continued his magdump, silently dreading that click. Once it inevitably happened, he speedily reloaded the Latron and then slipped his body back out of the Warframe, bracing his right arm equipped with an unpainted Mote Amp.  The lanky Operator sent a beam of Void energy down into the hole, strafing the Sentients emerging. His face contorted into one of extreme focus, and the beam flickered more than what would be expected from a Tenno.

<strong>INTELLECTUS</strong>

Finally, his messages got through! Intellectus established a shaky, but active, connection to his Master once again, and the two swiftly exchanged information and requests. Evaluating the combat situation, things looked...oh dear. He needed to work fast.

&quot;Apologies, I was busy trying to slip through a Limbo distortion, and organize a supply canister for my Master at the same time. I&#39;ve informed him of the situation, and he should be sending your other half up with an ally soon, while he keeps up the fight.&quot;

The Cephalon dutifully set about putting together the requested supply pod, feeling it a <em>tad</em> wasteful to use one just for a drone that he could replace in a few hours. But desperate times, he supposed. And the Master&#39;s orders were absolute.</span>

He grabbed the datamass with no further word, but a simple nod of acknowledgement to the additional request. He then turned to follow the route the reinforcements had taken.

&quot;Hold the line, 5 minutes ETA.&quot; He added as he was passing the threshold out the room.

Then, switching to his private comms he sent out the emergency delivery request to his cephalon: ammo packs and the archgun. <em>&quot;No time for chit-chat, Hue&quot;</em> Was all he could add to the message before sending it and breaking into a full on sprint.</span>

&quot;Frankly I have no idea where our mark could be now or what the muck they could be up to. There&#39;s no way it they could&#39;ve known about all this,&quot; the Limbo responded.

<strong>Hydroid:</strong> 
&quot;Wait for them to get tired?&quot; the Hydroid repeated incredulously, pulling his shotgun off his shoulder and reloading while taking a position near the edge of the pit. &quot;What war were you part of? These things don&#39;t <em>get</em> tired! Either we kill them or they kill us!&quot; 

Without having a clear target, the Hydroid launched five grenades from his Corinth into the darkness below, each blast briefly illuminating the horde of Sentients.

~Three grenades comprised of void energy launched from the Vauban&#39;s Granmu Prism and exploded on top of the nearest sentient, ripping it to pieces and injuring nearby sentients. The ascending enemies kept taking the sustained fire now mixed with void energy until suddenly, they stopped. In unison, they switched on their phasing forms and let gravity pull themselves back down, down, down into the darkness.~

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
The Limbo fell prone and stuck his head over the edge of the hole, watching them retreat.

&quot;See? Get tired. Or tactically retreat. Whichever way you wanna say it,&quot; he clarified. Pulling his head out of the hole and into eye level with the group. He didn&#39;t make any move to release his hold on the Rift Cataclysm yet.

&quot;I had a feeling they were bluffing. They must be low on forces and intel down there and didn&#39;t want to risk it all. We scared them, if just a little. That just makes their presence here even more confusing,&quot; his eyes drifted to one of the cloning vats that had crashed onto the floor, spilling out its deceased, hybridized occupant. 

&quot;...Though, I&#39;m beginning to figure it out.&quot;</span>

The Sentients were retreating. Max gave himself a slight bit of credit for the defense, but for the most part he knew it had been the efforts of their new allies that had really made the difference. Flexing the hand his Mote Amp covered, he slowly felt his body pull back to the confines of the Excalibur frame, straightening out its back and standing up, once again Dominus.

&quot;Maybe we can use this downtime for a bit of context. Lupin and I were here to do just that, look into the Grineer operations and if necessary, purge any data they had on Sentient functions, before wrecking the place and rendering it unusable. As we made our way inside, we ran into-&quot; He gestures to the Hydroid, &quot;-our friend here, who had been ripping and tearing their way through the facility for reasons I don&#39;t think we ever got out of you.&quot;

Finally, he turned to the Limbo and his cadre, rolling his neck to break up some of his stiffness. &quot;So what mark exactly are you pursuing? Could they have anything to do with this as well?&quot;</span>

Initially unaware to the change in degree of urgency (though the existence of the threat was in itself justification enough), he had kept his sprint up, towards the surface, and (hopefully) to an awaiting combination of reinforcements and airlift for the new cephalon acquaintance.

It would still take him at least another minute or so to reach the surface, and even then the alert on the corner of his eye informed him that landing was (as expected) dangerous and likely to expose the operation, but that hardly mattered any more, and his repeated hand gestures to dismiss the messages made a point of it.

&quot;Any updates?&quot; He managed to ask on comms as he slowed down to gauge between the elevator or a long climb up a ventilation shaft.</span>

In another flash of green and orange light, the young man was gone, the Vauban rising to its feet again and moving towards one of the hybrids.
“We’re technically still trying to figure that part out.” The Vauban said, giving the Excalibur a glance before kneeling next to the body.

&quot;Like I told that Cephalon, you can take all the data you want. I&#39;m killing everything in here, breaking everything else, then flooding the place.&quot; Peering downwards, the Hydroid tried to get a read on how deep this pit was. With luck, it would take him somewhere he could do some real damage.

<strong>Limbo:</strong> 
&quot;Good idea Chegar,&quot; the Limbo remarked before turning to Dominus.

&quot;Maybe. Probably not. We&#39;re chasing something that came here from the outside...&quot;

The Limbo looked down at the synoid gammacor on his hip. On the surface of its top-orientated prong, a small red symbol burned brightly, trailing small wisps of scattered energy particles as he moved slightly.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His stomach dropped into his gut. He froze in his bent position, and drew in a deep breath. He figured he had seconds to act. A single message was sent through text to the Saryn&#39;s and Vauban&#39;s displays:

<span class="pre pre--inline">It&#39;s here. On me.</span>

Everything next happened in the blink of an eye. The Limbo swiped over the mark and snapped the gammacor to his wrist. The lights on the device turned from their usual cyan to an angry red. The Limbo straightened up and sharply cried out as large red lines of energy surged from the device through his arm, over his shoulder, and directly into the torso of his chassis. His sight filled with red light as it revealed secrets to him regarding the true nature of certain things. Before he got a chance to get his bearings, the Hydroid&#39;s shadow expanded twice in size across the floor and rounded out into an oval shape. At the same time, it rose out of the ground like a mass of indeterminable black goop.

The Limbo&#39;s head snapped to its position and he quickly aimed his gammacor at it. It pulsed with deadly red light and filled the air with an oscillating vibrations as it charged. The Hydroid took a step back, only to find his ankles bound by the goop. It opened up like a large maw and proceeded to swallow him whole. A beam of red energy released from the Limbo&#39;s gammacor only to miss the creature by mere nanoseconds as it squished into a puddle on the floor and evaporated into thin air, taking the Hydroid with it. 

The beam collided with a tank positioned behind where the Hydroid use to stand, but didn&#39;t mark the glass at all. The Limbo tried to cut it off, but his own arm wouldn&#39;t respond to his wishes. His eyes went wide with panic as he swung his other arm over the gammacor to pull it off. With a few swipes he managed to stop the beam, but the red veins of energy wouldn&#39;t leave his chassis. His arm was stuck in the pose of firing. He furiously ran his fingers over the gammacor, doing everything he could to get it to stop.</span>

“Gutz Gutz Gutz Gutz Gutz!”
The Vauban recoiled rapidly, launching himself backward towards the limbo. He pulled his angstrum, and readied a bastille in his off hand. 
“Alright. Does any one have anything like a flood light?! If this thing is binding to shadows, I wanna limit its movement!” He belted out, lobbing the bastille at the creatures last known location. That’s when he saw the limbo’s predicament.

Max was quick to react, switching over to his Pangolin Sword to use it as a focus, and once again unholstering Thumper to act as a sidearm.

&quot;I can illuminate. Starting with three pulses, then maintaining.&quot;

Raising the sword high above his head, a purple light began gathering at the tip, the Excalibur keeping his vision locked on the Limbo (they called him Dis, he thought he heard) as he struggled with his sidearm. Was this creature affecting their weapons? Or the functions of their frames as a whole?

&quot;Radial Blind, first pulse!&quot;

The blinding light went out, masked for Warframes yet still capable of illuminating most of their surroundings. Dominus swept his kitgun along a 180 degree angle, looking for this strange creature. He abstained from firing for the moment, to avoid getting locked into place like the Limbo had. Better safe than sorry.

&quot;Second pulse! What is this thing? New to you guys, or are you familiar?&quot;

The next wave of light went out, as the Excalibur twisted and swept his sidearm along the opposite degree, not sure how fast their quarry was really moving.

&quot;Third pulse, and maintaining!&quot;

One last wave, and then the glow stabilized, not quite as bright as the average Blind, but enough to cast them all in the purple aura, and more importantly, give whatever was on them fewer places to hide. He wasn&#39;t sure exactly how much energy he had left in the tank after his usage of the Exalted Blade. Hopefully Lupin brought the heavy artillery soon.</span>

The Saryn stood up from the corpse she was scanning as lupin mentioned the hydroid was was here from the start. Her grip shifted back to her rifle as she began to look around the rest of the room now, making her way around behind the hydroid. She didn&#39;t even wait for the Limbo&#39;s warning, her gun was already leveled on her opponent and finger squeezing the trigger by the time the signal went out, though in her effort to line up an easy shot to the head, the Limbo seemed to have inadvertently warned the thing with his scanner. One shot rang out at the mass as it consumed the hydroid.

Her gaze next fell upon that troublesome gammacor the limbo trying to turn off. For that she had a simple solution: another report filled the chamber as she fired at the gammacor, targeting the section positioned above his wrist.</span>

All three flashes came and went without anything out of the ordinary popping into view. Nothing seemed to be affected by the radial blind, at least.

Chegar&#39;s bastille met a similar predicament where it hit the ground, activated, and then didn&#39;t seem to catch anything within its stasis field.

The Saryn&#39;s shot harmlessly deflected off a building cluster of red energy radiating from the gammacor. Whatever was happening, the device was being protected.~

The Limbo watched the Saryn&#39;s shot accomplish nothing and fell to his knees, arm still locked in position.

Without another word the Saryn stepped up to the limbo, placing her rifle on her back and pulling out her massive galatine. She swung it downward at the Limbo&#39;s arm, aiming to cut just above whatever energy was protecting the gammacor ended, attempting to preserve as much of the arm as she could. Knowing how the fight with the Weaver went, they would need every portion of themselves as operational as could be for this fight.</span>

With the Limbo’s arm steady, Isa managed to barely cut through the chinks in his sword-steel and straight through his technocyte flesh, severing the arm from his body. In a flash of red light, it immediately ceased its function and the tendrils of energy around the Limbo dispersed as it dropped to the ground.

The Limbo fell into a sitting position, propping himself up on one of the nearby containers that hadn’t been completely decimated. He kicked his lost arm, with the gammacor still mounted to it, further away from him and caught his breath.

After a couple of seconds he looked up at the Excalibur who had been conversing with them.

“Sorry, explanations come now. You said your name was Dominus? Good to have you here. The Vauban’s Chegar, the Saryn’s Isa, and my name... is Disruptis.”</span>

Finally, some proper introductions, if not a particularly intense way to get them. The Excalibur lowered his sword and looked back to the trio, staying where he was in the off-chance that whatever was attacking them focused him next, so the others didn&#39;t get caught in it.

&quot;The feeling&#39;s mutual, trust me. Nice to meet you all. With everything I&#39;ve seen so far, we definitely needed the extra firepower. That red light looked...bad. Real bad. Just what the hell is going on here?&quot;

The Vauban (Chegar, remember that) mentioned Vazarin. Someone that can heal even Warframes, fantastic.

&quot;Naramon, on my end. Not that there&#39;s been much opportunity for me to strategize thus far. But that&#39;s why I use an Excalibur. Easy to plan around cutting things up with a blade.&quot;</span>

Isa quietly placed her galatine on her back once more and drew her rifle.

She asked, seemingly having little to no interest in conversing with the others at this time. Even as she spoke to Disruptis she didn&#39;t look at him and instead moved about, weapon ready to fire on the creature should it appear again.</span>

&quot;Yes please, Chegar,&quot; Disruptis replied gratefully.  He addressed Isa next.

&quot;Four months back, shortly after the whole Weaver thing happened in Kawamo, we found something with the power to strip some types of abnormalities of their powers. Not only that though, but it <em>really</em> hurt them when hit with it, so much so that it would kill them with enough contact. All it takes is one good shot for most and it&#39;s lights out for them. Also can give you a special sight that outlines them for you, and doesn&#39;t even leave a scratch on anything that&#39;s not an abnormal. Really useful stuff. That&#39;s why I can tell you it somehow warped itself somewhere much lower in the facility. It&#39;s way out of our range now, but I&#39;m not sure if it can come back.&quot;

&quot;Problem is, this power... its got some really nasty pre-requisites that we&#39;re having trouble trying to meet, so barely anyone can use it. Chegar here is one of the few people that could&#39;ve taken a mark into his body to use it, but he respectfully declined and I totally get why. I installed a kind of hack to be able to use it myself, but it&#39;s not the first thing I think about using. Void, I probably wouldn&#39;t have even used it if we weren&#39;t also dealing with sentients for some reason.&quot;

He swiveled back to Dominus again, giving a weak smile in his Tenno form that couldn&#39;t be seen from the outside of his warframe. 

&quot;Uhhh... where to begin... have you heard of /RU Corp? Here to deal with the unknown when it inevitably comes? We came here to look for a creature with strange powers and capture or kill it. And as you can see it uh...&quot; the Limbo swallowed, &quot;...just escaped. Naramon on my end too, though. As of recently I specialize in making plans that fail.&quot;</span>

&quot;/RU Corp...vaguely. I&#39;ve seen the name in listings, that much I know for certain. Didn&#39;t think you were this involved, though.&quot;

Since the creature didn&#39;t seem inclined to strike out at them again, he slowly backs towards the rest of the team, dropping to one knee and letting out a breath, processing all of the incoming information.

&quot;So, first plan failed, but we do have the excuse of having several unforeseen variables throw themselves into the mix. So what&#39;s the next idea? Clean out these Sentients and then go hunting for your mark once Lupin&#39;s back with his weapon and my drone?&quot;</span>

She looked around the room once more.
&quot;Regardless of if we do or not, we should gather data on these subjects and wipe whatever the Grineer have on them here... and possibly destroy this base as well. I have ordnance I could call down from my orbiter. Since the place has been practically wiped out, it can easily be planted via proxies.&quot;</span>

The vauban took a knee once more, it’s operator stepping into view again in another burst of void energy. He rushed over to Disruptis, letting a wave of regenerative void energy wash over the wounded limbo’s stump.
“Feels like a case of ‘<em>all roads lead to Rome</em>’ to me; recover as much data as we can, purge all mundane threats, and regroup to assess our plans, assets, and deficits.” He said, keeping an eye on the stump.
“On a side note, how do you wanna deal with your arm? Tag and bag? Replantation? Write-off?”</span>

“Yeah Chegar, just get rid of it if you can,” Disruptis replied.

He took in a deep breath as the exposed technocyte flesh of his arm sealed up with swordsteel. The energy also closed deep wounds leftover from the lines that raced to the left side of his chest.

“I think you both got it right. Find out what the muck is going on here, don our Old War faces, then maybe save a Hydroid. If we can’t easily bag the SED, might as well just destroy it before it gets any funny ideas. It looked like it was hiding in the Hydroid’s shadow somehow, and if it can warp like that I’m not sure how to take it in with what we have on hand…. wait…”

The Limbo looked up at Dominus.

The Excalibur would smile if he could. Instead, he just offers a thumbs-up.

&quot;I had honestly thought the SED was somehow disguising as the Hydroid to be honest and was about to put a bullet in its head. It was entirely too convenient. A water-controlling frame that was here before any of us. The Hydroid may very well be in league with it still.&quot;</span>

&quot;Okay.&quot; Chegar said, disappearing in a flash as his Vauban stood and marched toward the group. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be at any further risk of bleed out, but you&#39;ll definitely need to get that patched and replaced after this.&quot;He continued.&quot;Meanwhile, I&#39;ll see if I can get a resource drone to grab the arm for us; we&#39;ll dispose of it afterword.&quot;
He looked around the group, mulling over what had been said.
&quot;Clean up the grineers mess, Find the SED, Rescue or salvage a Hydroid, and disposed of an arm.&quot; He said, Nodding. &quot;I&#39;d say we have a full docket.&quot; With that, he turned to Isa.

Disruptis let out a short, involuntary laugh before snapping his mouth shut.

<em>How long has it been since I’ve met a Tenno like this…</em> he mused, hanging his head.

“Thanks,” he said quietly.

The Limbo pushed himself off his back support and started pacing the room in thought.

“That’s the thing though Isa, I didn’t see anything really <em>abnormal</em> about the Hydroid through the Mark of Defying. Sure he might be in cahoots with that thing but… let’s just say that’d be a first for Weaver. She doesn’t like consorting with outside forces, especially Tenno. Could be wrong though, and as you know I’m not a fan of taking many chances right now.”</span>

&quot;He threw me off a bit when we first ran into the guy down here, but he committed to fighting the Sentients pretty fast. Either he&#39;s a great actor, or he&#39;s not a threat. And I think with a monster like that rolling around, he would&#39;ve attacked Lupin and I a lot earlier when we were by ourselves, rather than wait for an opportunity once we were all together.&quot;

He paused, thinking. Suddenly it dawned on him. &quot;Lupin. Do you think that thing is hunting him?&quot;

They&#39;d only been working together for a few hours, but it wouldn&#39;t do to leave a good Tenno in the lurch. They needed as much help as they could muster.</span>

&quot;Never underestimate an opponent&#39;s ability to adapt. Besides, I would only be destroying a frame of his if he was not aligned with the Weaver. An inconvenience, possibly a major one for him, but a warframe is replaceable.&quot;

Isa tilted her head a bit when Dominus brought up the thing hunting him.

“An abnormality hiding in a shadow. A Tenno’s shadow. An abnormality that was happy hiding itself away until it saw that it was gonna be exposed. Then it spirited away its hiding place. An abnormality created to...” he thought aloud. The Tenno pictured the nuances of the Hydroid’s reaction to the sudden shift, but it was difficult to divine reactions behind a warframe.

&quot;Assuming it wasn&#39;t a Tenno, we can rule out a host of melee weapons. Surgical tools; could go either way.&quot; Chegar chimed in, idly nodding in thought.
&quot;Actually, if our target has fled for the time being, we may have some time to do an on sight autopsy.&quot; Chegar said, looking around the room. &quot;all we need is a relatively fresh corpse, and enough time to look for trace evidence inside the cranium.&quot; 
He then looked over to the tank the Hydroid had been standing near.
&quot;And pray the thing doesn&#39;t double back.&quot;</span>

The Excalibur rose back to his feet, looking to see if there were any said fresh corpses in the area. &quot;Maybe not here, but back closer to where we met the Hydroid. He was on a tear through the facility, so if we check the bodies further back, whatever&#39;s been here might have scooped up the brains in his absense.&quot;

Hefting his rifle, he nodded. &quot;As a squad. If Lupin&#39;s potentially been attacked, we need to stick together.&quot;</span>

&quot;We noticed some Grineer further back missing their brains, yes. We could perform some more analysis on them... we had just assumed our mark of course, but that Hydroid has added in something new to factor for investigation.&quot;

She looks to Disruptis.

Disruptis stood over the gaping hole in the floor, arms clasped behind his back and staring into its depths. He spent a few seconds in silence.

“No,” he finally responded, “...no… no, I don’t think we should leave <em>this</em> alone. Someone tell Lupin to bring down one of the brain-scooped bodies for us but… These sentients. Did you see them change forms to an almost oculyst-like suit? And then they started phasing through everything?” 

Disruptis whirled around to face the group, arms outstretched, “Have any of you heard or seen these ghost-like sentients before? There was a specialized type of sentient fragments back in the Old War that we called Phantoms. They were rare, usually sticking to the backlines and loading up on battle info, until they wiped out a colony on this very planet.”</span>

Even as he worked his comms network to send Lupin the request for one of the corpses, hoping he hadn&#39;t already been attacked by something or somebody, Max was thinking behind the depths of his Warframe. Then Disruptis said something that clicked into place. Phantoms. An isolated memory, but it was there nonetheless. Of standing in front of a console with a holographic image, displaying reported and analyzed Sentient types. More shadowy figures around him, a part he couldn&#39;t remember. But he knew this much.

&quot;...Yeah. I know what you&#39;re talking about. I had a feeling they felt familiar once they started phasing out. I don&#39;t know if I ever fought them myself, but I definitely remember seeing reports of them. Maybe I fought on this planet during the Old War too.&quot;

That was reassuring, if nothing else. His memories were in there somewhere.</span>

&quot;Sounds like a Vomvalyst on steroids.&quot; Chegar said flatly, trying to recall if he had ever encountered one. He shook his head.
&quot;The tactics sound familiar. But the sentient type... I&#39;m can&#39;t remember encountering one before or not.&quot;</span>

&quot;The Grineer must&#39;ve either found a fragment we missed and woke it up, or they, and/or the Sentients themselves, have figured out how to regenerate them. Either way, this is severely problematic. The ones we&#39;re dealing with now are bad enough, another resurgence just can&#39;t be tolerated.&quot;

“All I’m saying is some Phantoms survived, and we can’t afford to let them see the light of space. Ikazu’s fragments were masters of collecting info. They compiled tons of combat data from the Old War, the likes of which boggle my mind. If the sentient Mother we’re fighting right now gained access to that... well we’d be mucked. Much less if they got the help of Phantoms in our New War.”

Disruptis waved a dismissive stump towards Dominus, adding a small “Don’t worry about it.”

“If I’m right in thinking the SED was a drone sent to harvest goods and bring them back to Weaver, I doubt she’s involved. She doesn’t micromanage her drones. I can’t tell if she could’ve known that these sentients were here, but if so then I wouldn’t be surprised if the only thing she was doing was breaking them down for parts. Weaver doesn’t like Sentients… for good reason. She definitely wouldn’t want any waking up.”

He paced the room once again in habit. “Let’s think. New facility. Extending down a deep-sea chasm on Uranus. Phantoms locked in lower levels. Substantial amounts of Hybrid Grineer. Hmmm.”

He pivoted back to the group. “Yeah, only one way I see this. Grineer digging into things they shouldn’t, yet again. This is recent, so I believe all the fragments are still here. If we wipe them out here before they make contact with their friends still chilling in the Origin system, we can stop another resurgence from happening. No trash on Hayden, but I think we can pull the brakes on this thing right now. Once Lupin returns we’re locking up and I’m going with whoever wants to rattle some Sentient bones on an extermination mission. Who’s in?”</span>

&quot;And I&#39;m already committed. It wouldn&#39;t be right for me to dip on this job right when it&#39;s escalating, not when people are counting on us.&quot;

Easier said than done, but Max wasn&#39;t about to chicken out. Some small, quiet part of him wouldn&#39;t stand for it. Like he&#39;d been in this exact situation once before. He was in good repair, he had energy, and they were a team.

They had as good a chance of any at pulling this off.</span>

&quot;I am willing to help. I have not encountered these phantoms before and would like the opprotunity to study them.&quot;

She looks around once more.

&quot;Shall I call in some proxies to keep watch for the SED and prevent any possible Grineer reenforcements from coming in behind us?&quot;</span>

Disruptis felt a grin wrinkle the folds of his mouth, but tried to stifle it. After everything he’d been through, he held some small part of him that felt he didn’t deserve… <em>that</em>. Not yet.

“Good idea Isa, but keep them topside. We don’t want Sentients hacking an entire army of MOA against us. We’re gonna need every upper hand we can get if we’re going down there. While you’re at it, can you send a message to my orbiter? I need Coal to get me a new suit… and a gammacor that <em>won’t</em> try to kill me.”

The black and yellow Limbo rubbed his wrist as he stared into the depths of the facility. It had been years since he last fought a Sentient, but he had already begun settling into a headspace he hadn’t felt since the Old War.

If there was one thing he knew how to do: it was raiding Sentients.
