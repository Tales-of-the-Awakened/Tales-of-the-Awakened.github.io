    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Kuve and Vuko follow the mysterious Grineer woman as they traversed the red, dusty
            caverns and plateaus of the Martian landscape. They weaved in and out of caves, following some kind of
            unmarked pathway that the Grineer had seemed to memorize; each cavern they entered seemed identical, each
            fork in the road bore no difference from the previous or next. The harsh sunlight beat down on them, a major
            contrast to the relative darkness of the sanctuary they had crawled from.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soon enough, after what seemed, and more so felt, like hours of clambering over the
            red rocks, Vuko and Kuve noticed an ever increasing amount of Grineer equipment. Upon exiting the next
            cavern, the tall, stout appearance of a Grineer Settlement&#39;s reactor could be seen- they were nearing a
            camp. It was at this point that the Grineer woman wordlessly pulled them aside into a small crawlspace,
            hidden from plain view thanks to a patch of Ruk&#39;s Klaw that had been growing over the entrance. The
            inside of the small room was filled with a stockpile of supplies, weapons and old, spare Grineer
            armour.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This is alloy armour. Not the best there is for combat but it will help hide
            your identities while we&rsquo;re here. Let&rsquo;s try and not get into trouble&quot;, the mysterious
            entity explains as she begins taking vests and other parts from the stockpile, and handing them to the two
            skeptical Tenno. Her voice, clearly distorted by some frequency modifier visible in her neck, sounds
            artificially basso, as if deepened significantly. Her posture is oddly neutral, lacking any noticeable body
            language to interpret out of it, but it is clear that what she wears is quite loose and does not fit
            properly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This is not going to fit me...&quot;, the blonde girl complains as she scans
            one of the pieces handed to her up and down. She frowns at the opaque colours, looking at them with the same
            despise someone would look at an unwanted dish offered to them in a banquet.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He starts putting on the armor
            carefully, visibly having problems recognizing what part goes where, as it clearly is not made for his body
            type. - &ldquo;I know that now is not the time for questions, so I&rsquo;m not going to ask why we are doing
            what we are doing. But I need to know the task at hand.&rdquo; - He pauses for a moment, focusing on an arm
            guard instead, as he is having trouble fitting it on. - &ldquo;What do we need to accomplish?&rdquo; - Vuko
            asks after a moment of deliberation, demanding an answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;There is an asset held at the heart of the camp in a containment cell that
            isolates infested tissue. I tried my best but found no evidence of any Warframes stored in the Mars facility
            so... said asset is the only way we can get out of here. The plan is to free him&quot;, the rescuer explains
            while revising the ammo in her pouches, and double checking on her weapons. A pair of submachine guns that
            resemble Twin Grakatas rest on the outer sides of her thighs, a belt filled with unknown gadgets surrounds
            her hips, and a Grinlok hangs loosely behind her back. Her movements are relaxed but efficient, not going
            out of their intended objective but not being uptight either. Her personalized gear display a double feature
            everywhere: the duplicate decorations, the number of firing modes, the number of ammo boxes, etc.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Our cookies are stored in Lua... unless that place has also been
            salvaged&quot;, the blonde girl says as she begins putting on some of the leg armour in one of the
            stockpiles. She does not struggle with the process, and in fact seems to be oddly familiar with befitting
            the parts. She frowns in surprise, for this is the first time she sees the gear.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;A simple extraction
            then.&rdquo; - The Tenno smirks in comment, and begins putting on the torso piece. After struggling for a
            moment, the armor finally falls in place. Vuko now in full disguise, continues the conversation. - &ldquo;Is
            the asset hostile? What is the security system? How much opposition can we expect? I need you to tell me
            everything you know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wish I could... but I&rsquo;ve got no time for that... nor the patience. Follow
            me&quot;, the figure concludes as she grabs the last item, shoves it inside one of her back pockets, and
            leads the way out of the cave acting as a warehouse.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She turns right, then left, then continue forward, and repeat, the similarities
            between the cave entrances are such that it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to discern whether they are returning
            where they came from or moving to a new area. She does not seem to wait for the Tenno, or even check if they
            are keeping up with her pace, and her demeanour is a drastic change from the relaxed posture when they were
            idling in the cave. Suddenly, she stops at another fork, staring, perplexed, at four identical entrances.
            The stranger instinctively looks back at Kuve, as if expecting a reminder.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;...What...? Do I... have pudding... on my face? I blame Vuko...&quot;, the
            young girl manages to reply in-between desperate exhalations. Her face has turned red out of the sheer
            effort put into the recent cardio exercise that was not getting too far behind the individual.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&rsquo;t you recognize this place at all...?&quot;, the Grineer soldier
            complains out loud with both arms stretched out wide, before placing them back on her hips, and pacing back
            and forth while looking at their options.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&rsquo;s probably... been years... since I... &quot;, the blonde girl begins
            before her look shifts drastically from inattentive and confused to somewhat familiar and recognizing. She
            continues hyperventilating while staring at the four open routes, weighing them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He follows shortly behind Kuve,
            without too much effort, only exhaling a bit more loudly than usual, despite the armor weighing him down.
            &quot;She has fallen out of shape. Propably too much sweets. I&#39;ll have to take for a few workout
            sessions when we get out of this mess.&quot; Vuko thinks to himself upon seeing his companion&#39;s face
            turn into a tomato.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mysterious Grineer stops,
            seeming to have lost the way, the Tenno begins to curiously observe the situation, suspecting something is
            afoot. Once the soldier starts asking questions to Kuve, as if she knew her, he decides its time to step in.
            With confidence in his step he quickly positions himself inbetween the two, instinctivly trying to cover the
            blonde Tenno. - &quot;Who. The Void. Are you.&quot; - Says Vuko, accentuating every word, in a demanding
            tone, while gesturing a bit too agressively with his hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kuve answers the woman, he turns
            his head a bit to the side to look at her, while not loosing sight of the stranger. - &quot;What?&quot; - He
            says, much more silently than before, a pinch of suprise painting on his face.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;...second from... left to right...?&quot;, she incredulously suggests after a
            while with a raised eyebrow. She does not remember being in this place before but there&#39;s some intimate
            semblance of it in the back of her mind, as if she had seen it before in a dream she had long forgotten
            about. The notion is certainly vague, the picture is completely blurry, and the more she tries to recall it
            the more she gets convinced the memory does not belong to her. It is as if it had been injected into her
            without her knowing. The kind of memory one cannot explain but simply accepts it&#39;s there. &quot;...but
            how...?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Good enough, let&#39;s go! Go go go!&quot;, the stranger concludes,
            purposefully ignoring Vuko&#39;s question, before rushing ahead of the pair once more. She sprints at an
            impressive pace, without bending her torso to one side or the other unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary to
            dodge the sprouts growing out of the rock. The visible shake in her armour once more reveals it is bigger
            than her body frame, and is possibly slowing her down, though it is hard to imagine her silhouette going at
            any higher speed as the difference in distance from the pair of Tenno is already unbelievable.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once the figure spots what appears to be a balcony at the exit of the tunnel, she
            positions her feet adequately to engage in an elegant slide that halts her momentum at the precise moment
            her feet reaches the edge. After the displacement feat is done, she pulls out her sniper to recon the area
            below.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Below, a large valley, either carved out or natural, sat filled with noisy Grineer
            machinery. Small pools of water littered about the place, glistening with a rainbow light as the sun&#39;s
            rays reflected off the spilled oil that covered them. Most of these machines were generators, or water
            purifiers; things necessary for sustaining the rest of the camp, which was further ahead, behind a second
            mountain of red stone. A tunnel connected the main camp to this industrial park, with Grineer troops milling
            about the entrance. They were undoubtedly supposed to be on guard duty, but they seemed to be playing some
            kind of game of chance.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~To the woman&#39;s right, a sandy slope led down, sloping left and ending just on
            the outskirts of the field of machines. It didn&#39;t look like many Grineer were aware of the path- the
            bottom of the dusty road was covered in rough, large rocks. Big enough to warrant a climb over them, but
            also small enough to keep it easy- there was no way any rule-abiding Grineer would venture out of their way
            for a stroll through the martian wild lands.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;She is really pissing me
            off.&rdquo; - He comments to Kuve after the mysterious woman ran away. Vuko tries to go after her, but she
            is much faster than he is, so instead of wasting his breath, he follows at his own speed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he catches up and sees the
            soldier standing on the edge of the balcony. The view takes him by surprise, as the crude and primitive
            technology makes him wince. The Tenno then comes up to her left, takes a knee and pulls a small object out
            of one of his many pockets. It is a small binocular, grey and gold, with a very characteristic Orokin
            aesthetic to it. Vuko then begins to survey the area, hoping to learn something that will help him along the
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Vuko manages to spot a Grineer Mining Tank parked on the side of the dust bowl,
            facing into the cliff face. It looks like they were drilling a new tunnel, although the smooth lines along
            the dug out portions make it look like that machine hadn&#39;t operated for months.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking upwards further, Vuko can see some air traffic of a few Grineer Firbolgs
            escorted by Dargyns, undoubtedly shuttling supplies both offworld and to the encampments. As Vuko follows
            the trajectory of one of the unmanned ships, he spots something much, much larger lurking in the sky,
            although obscured by the wispy clouds.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;To the right&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;To the right&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Both ladies point out in unison after the soldier lowers her rifle and turns to face
            the duo. The blonde girl reacts with eyes wide open, and using her left hand to point at the stranger.
            &quot;Jinx&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Jinx&quot;, the woman whispers without a single millisecond of latency from the
            Tenno&#39;s response. She slides her sniper behind her back and slowly makes her way down the slope at the
            same time she continues the mini game with an amused tone of voice. &quot;...double Jinx...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Double Jinx!&quot;, the blonde girl adds at the exact same time as if both
            tongues were one and the same. She follows closely behind the Grineer and smiles stupidly as an intense
            hunch rises in her guts, and doesn&#39;t wait a single second before continuing the word game albeit with a
            personal twist. &quot;Triple tart&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Quadruple muffin&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you? You&#39;re a fake&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And so, we break...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;...apart, but never awake.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You keep being the silliest of us all&quot;\</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And yet... the prettiest&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;What the...&rdquo; - He
            mumbles while seeing what the two of them are doing. - &ldquo;..no.. that&rsquo;s... that&rsquo;s not
            possible... is it?&rdquo; - He continues to speak under his nose, to himself, while following them down the
            slope. There was a suspicion growing inside his head, he saw such levels of synchronization before, but that
            would imply... Vuko stops himself, even though the idea is drilling inside his mind. He decides to stay
            quiet for now, as they are getting close to the camp.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The growling of Grineer machinery steadily grew louder as they entered the small
            valley, like a wild animal grumbling about its hunger. Soon enough, they were at the base of the slope, but
            had not been seen by any of the Grineer guards yet.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The plan is simple. You guys have some magic up your sleeve, right? I need you
            to knock out the guards around the made-up prison while I pierce the glass holding the asset inside.
            There&#39;s a locker room about ten meters to the northwest of the area. Deposit the unconscious bodies
            there. That should erase all evidence of our intervention&quot;, the soldier explains as she continues her
            way through the harsh pathway, jumping from side to side as fast as possible without making any significant
            noise whenever landing. She constantly checks on what seems to be a digital watch attached to her right
            wrist, and seems to fasten the pace every time she does. &quot;There&#39;s not much time left, the prison is
            scheduled to be shipped off-world. Hurry up&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Tenno remains quiet while listening to the instructions provided by the stranger,
            but her smile has not faded at all from her face. She no longer seems to be as tired as before, though
            whether it is out of inspiration, or perhaps adrenaline, is impossible to tell.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Pheee.. magic.. do I look
            like a wizard to you?&rdquo; - He asks rhetorically. He then goes over to Kuve, puts his hand on her
            shoulder hoping to tether her back to reality. - &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take left, you take right, ok?&rdquo; -
            Vuko slowly moves into position, giving his companion time to do the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Okii okii!&quot;, she replies while readying herself in the allotted location.
            Once there, the blonde girl takes her time to seize the amount of enemies and begins sketching the best
            order in which to engage them without the rest noticing her movements right away, and as soon as she&#39;s
            finished with her internal discussion, shows her companions a thumbs up and nods in agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;On the count of three... Three!&quot;, the soldier finally comments before
            climbing the last rock in the path and heading straight through the tunnel connecting the area to the main
            camp.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kul Gok:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah, you cheat! You cheat!&quot; One of the Grineer playing picked up one of the
            dice, throwing it at the other playing</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gol Gor:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I no cheat! You are just bad! You skoomrat!&quot; He raised a clenched fist to
            the other.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kul Gok:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Fine!&quot; he spat, as the other surrounding Grineer pushed on them, calming
            them down, &quot;One more. If you win, aagaahun, YOU ARE CHEAT!&quot; He picked up the dice and started to
            roll.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes! He is cheat! Skoomrat! Can I play?&quot;, the blonde girl interrupts while
            sitting in the frog position in the space between two of them. She grins, and looks expectantly at the
            Grinner on her right for some seconds, then the one on her left for nearly the same amount of time before
            their reaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kul Gok:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You see?! Even she agree you are cheat! You are-&quot; The Grineer paused as he
            realized who was there. The group of Grineer went silent as they &nbsp;all stared at the girl.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gol Gor:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;IS TENNO SKOOM...!&quot; He cursed as reached for the Viper on his hip. The
            other Grineer began to do the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Tenno Skoom!&quot;, the girl replies with a giggle as she shifts her weight
            forward, stretching both arms out and joining her hands to cast Void Blast against the area between the two
            Grineer, and using the generated momentum to perform a front flip out of their reach. Should the blast hit
            any of the targets, Temporal Blast would take effect, slowing their movements during a brief amount of
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While standing behind the group of
            grineer, he rolls his eyes in reaction to Kuve&rsquo;s behavior.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the blast is fired, Vuko
            gets to work. He first starts by cutting out the legs of the nearest grineer from under him and grabbing him
            by the back of his armor and yanking him down to the ground. He follows it with a punch to the face as the
            solidier is on the ground, cyan energy radiating from the point of impact, ensuring a knockout.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lancer hit the ground, the
            two nearest enemies started slowly rotating their heads to see what knocked down their friend. Before they
            even had the chance to comprehend what happened, one of them, which was standing up, is quickly disposed of
            with roundhouse kick to the face, cyan hue lighting up the ugly face. The other one, which didn&rsquo;t yet
            have the chance to stand up, gets his head slammed into the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Several of the Grineer drop to the ground, knocked unconscious by the powerful
            void-infused strikes from Vuko&#39;s limbs. The Grineer who had been slammed into the table, wasn&#39;t out
            yet. One Grineer had managed to avoid the Temporal Blast and had lunged for Kuve.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kul Gok:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You... nasty teno sun ofra gumfra! Prepare to-&quot; He got up to face Vuko,
            leveling his Viper at his face. But before anything could happen, the Grineer lunging for Kuve missed as she
            frontflipped out of the way, crashing into Kul Gok and knocking them both out. At this point, all the
            Grineer Lancers who were on guard were now all unconscious in a comical heap of Grineer armour.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Grineer soldier limits herself to sprint past the action and reach the pod
            without paying the slightest attention to what&#39;s going on with the surrounding guards. She does not seem
            worried in the least, and in fact looks quite relieved, as if some form of gratifying assurance is flowing
            in her veins. Once in position, she takes several small components out of her belt&#39;s pouches and
            dexterously assembles a thin drill the length of one of her arms; the device looks quite fragile, but proves
            otherwise once it comes into contact with the glass of the made up prison and begins piercing it with
            easiness.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Splendid work&quot;, she suddenly comments with a matter-of-fact tone of voice
            and still without looking.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Thanks! So what exactly are we liberating here?&quot;, the blonde girl replies
            with excitement before she witness some viscous liquid abundantly pouring out of the pod. Her facial
            expression soon changes from one of deep curiosity to one of complete disgust, and the smell does not help
            her reaction at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;... a business partner...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The pod resembled a Grineer Cloning pod, the major differences comprising of the
            fluid filling the chamber being a bright blue, and the object of interest within some dark red mass of flesh
            that resembled a massive heart. As the fluid poured out, the glass began to crack around the hole until the
            entire pod&#39;s front shattered open, causing the mound of flesh to fall to the dusty earth with a splat.
            It quivered and pulsated, slowly shedding an external layer of flesh until all that was left was a twisted
            looking, humanoid monster, obviously infested in nature. It opened its boney mouth and wheezed.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah.... I... wasn&#39;t left... did we do it....?&quot; The figure climbed to
            its knees, and wiped more of the blue fluid from its face. It regarded the 3 people before him.
            &quot;You&#39;re.... definitely not real Grineer... all too short... that means... we&#39;re all
            good...&quot; he began to stand up, but stopped as he violently retched, vomiting a copious amount of purple
            slime from its mouth, just narrowly missing Vuko&#39;s shoes. &quot;Urgh,&quot; it coughed, spitting the
            vile mixture from its mouth, &quot;They got inside me... need to get back to ship...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re on it, but we need to be discreet if we want to continue with our
            original plan... think you can fix those Grineer back there?&quot;, the soldier asks while checking around
            the area for any clues revealing their intervention; apart from the unconscious bodies lying on the ground.
            Her right foot suddenly taps energetically on the ground, denoting clear concern or impatience.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Bloody hell, what is this
            thing?!&rdquo; - He exclaims, stopping himself from screaming those words out loud, while also doing a step
            back. Had he not moved, the vomit would have hit him. - &ldquo;Is this... a Nidus? Seriously? That&rsquo;s
            who we came for?&rdquo; - Vuko turns on his heel, towards the unconscious bodies and proceeds to grab one of
            them, luggin it across the ground towards the aforementioned locker. - &ldquo;There&rsquo;s... no... need...
            to... fix... them...&rdquo; - The Tenno says, between each word tugging the body closer to the hiding spot.
            When he finally puts it away, he sees them looking at him. - &ldquo;What you staring at? Come &lsquo;ere and
            help me out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still shivering as if something was freezing him to his core, the Nidus walked over
            to the heap of Grineer, lifting up two of them and hanging them over his broad shoulders. &nbsp;His mouth
            contorted into a grimace, clearly pained. &ldquo;This... sucks a lot...&rdquo; he managed to gasp as he
            dropped the Grineer down at Vuko&rsquo;s spot. He then turned to a nearby Grineer locker, pulling out a
            Grineer rifle- the Hind. &ldquo;We might be needing... this thing. Aw muck, I&rsquo;m gonna b-&ldquo; He
            vomited again, covering the pile of three unconscious Grineer with the same purple slime, which upon closer
            inspection, appears to be a mixture of blood and the blue fluid from the prison device. &ldquo;Oh, the
            name&rsquo;s.... uh....&rdquo; he glanced at the soldier as he wiped his mouth, then turned back to Vuko.
            &ldquo;my name is Kapak. Sorry for the... unpleasant meeting.&rdquo; He coughed. &ldquo;These Grineer had
            to... really muck me up just to keep me... detained.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smirks upon seeing the Grineer
            covered in slime, imagining their faces when they wake up. - &ldquo;The name&rsquo;s Drakkainen. Vuko
            Drakkainen.&rdquo; - He turns back, headed towards the 3 bodies left out in the open.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yuck&quot;, the girl complains with revulsion at the same time she tries to
            cover the mess from her eyes by placing an open hand in front of her. &quot;Kuve... but something tells me
            you already knew that&quot;, she adds, spinning almost robotically in her spot just enough so she&#39;s
            facing the masked stranger. Her voice is particularly loud at the end of her sentence, and once finished,
            the blonde Tenno puts her free hand on her hip, and taps on the ground with her left foot in clear imitation
            of the behaviour of the subject in front of her. She periodically spreads the fingers wide open so she can
            peak on the soldier, and closes them again.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you alright? Do you need any help?&quot;, the mysterious woman asks the
            Nidus with just the faintest hint of quivering in her voice, but other than that does not seem to
            acknowledge either Tenno. She takes a quick peak at the clock on her wrist, presses a button on it, and
            stops tapping with her right foot as soon as Kuve begins imitating her. Her posture then changes completely,
            no longer chilled and loose, but stiff and disciplined. &quot;We need your ship to get out of here as
            discreetly as possible. There&#39;s enough scanners in the area to spot any aircraft in perhaps in a
            thousand kilometer radius, and we don&#39;t have the time to walk that sort of distance.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He stifled a groan, clearly trying to hide the pain he was in. &quot;I&#39;ll be...
            fine, we just need to get the heck out of here. I&#39;ll call for extraction.&quot; Kapak put the Hind over
            his shoulder, magnetically locking it onto his back as all Warframes could. There was something definitely
            different about this Nidus though- other than the presence of that strange mouth, his body seemed twisted
            and mangled, almost, although it was difficult to tell whether or not that was caused by soaking in the blue
            bath or if that was just his appearance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned to face the sky. &quot;Yes, yes, I know, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re glad.
            Just get the Orbiter as close to the surface as possible. What? Yeah, airspace may be hostile, but if we
            break atmosphere they&#39;ll lose us. Fomorian Weapons won&#39;t be able to track us. Right, right.&quot;
            *Kapak turned back to the three. &quot;Okay so- COUGH- my Orbiter&#39;s gonna swing down here, except we
            need to get to a higher point so that it can land long enough for us to jump aboard. We might end up
            attracting some attention from the Grineer on the ground, but hopefully not. I know for sure that once we
            get off planetside, they won&#39;t be able to track us, and we can just punch out. So, let&#39;s climb up
            there-&quot; *he pointed up the slope that Vuko, Kuve and the soldier had just come down, &quot;and we can
            board my ship from there. I know my Landing Craft would be much more discrete, but that would also warrant
            some... difficulties in boarding. So, let&#39;s move the rest of these Grineer kuaka-chasers an-&quot;
            Kapak&#39;s words were cut off by a gunshot, his shoulder spraying out a spatter of blood onto the red rock
            behind him. &quot;MUCK! Spotted by Grineer Ballistas...? Get down!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He listened to the plan in silence, trying to find the quickest and most
            efficient way to the top. The Nidus intrigued him, recomposing himself on such a short notice should have
            taken much more effort, yet it seemed to come so naturally to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shot landed he instinctively
            fell to the ground and crawled towards the nearest crate, taking cover behind it. - &ldquo;Well, stealth is
            out the window. Do any of you have new a plan?&rdquo; - Vuko comments, trying to find an exit out of the
            situation. While thinking about what they should do next, he fires a fireball in the general direction of
            the sniper, and uses the brief moment to take a peek and see how many they are facing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blonde girl had already begun playing hopscotch on her own while Kapak provided
            the instructions. She grew bored of long explanations extraordinarily fast, and her attention had become
            quite adept at finding activities to fill the gap in these moments of boredom, like how much makeup would be
            necessary to prepare the Nidus for a prom dance, or what kind of dress would accentuate her curves, or even
            how her charming prince would look like.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as the shot is heard, she releases a high-pitched scream and goes into void
            mode while falling to the ground and taking cover in similar fashion to Vuko. She does not look what the
            latter is aiming at but also uses void energy to fire a beam from her cover in roughly the same
            direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you think they saw us?&quot;, she sarcastically asks Vuko.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What&rsquo;s the ETA on your ship, Kapak?&quot;, the stranger questions
            immediately after positioning herself to receive cover from the made-up prison. She then grabs the sniper
            from her shoulder and rests its muzzle on the pod to get aim assistance. &quot;How long do we have to hold
            here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Vuko manages to see three Ballistas in a scouting tower- something that both him and
            the soldier were unable to see from their previous vantage point. Vuko&#39;s fireball ignited the tower,
            causing the three Grineer snipers to flail about and fall out of the tower as they burned. Kuve&#39;s Void
            Beam missed them entirely, but managed to sever the steel ropes supporting the tower. The tower creaked and
            groaned as it burned, tipping sideways and falling down the hillside, landing somewhere behind a mound of
            dirt.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;My Void, they&#39;re gonna be onto us now,&quot; Kapak growled as he rubbed his
            shoulder. Blood continued to dribble from the open wound, which fortunately was just a graze.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~To add insult to injury, whatever the burning sniper nest fell into was probably
            explosive, as the ground shook with the appearance of a massive orange fireball.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Guts.&quot; He turned and pointed upwards. &quot;Go now! Get up the slope!
            We&#39;ll have the height advantage from there!&quot; Kapak took the Hind off his back and turned to the
            soldier. &quot;We&#39;ve got 10 minutes for him to navigate through Grineer satellite patrols. I&#39;m sure
            we can hold off these cloned dickheads for that long, right?&quot; He looked at his shoulder. &quot;I just
            might have to be a little more careful for now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watches with surprise as the tower
            burns down and falls, as he didn&rsquo;t expect to hit at all, it was supposed to be covering fire. After a
            few moments, when the entire things is blown to smithereens, he once again covers himself behind the crate.
            When the initial dust settles, he looks in awe and pride at the destruction, a light smile forming under his
            nose.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vuko quickly covers it up, trying to
            pretend the explosion didn&rsquo;t excite him at all and turns to the magenta monster. - &ldquo;Yeah, it
            better not be any longer. We need to skiddadle.&rdquo; - He then gives Kuve a quick glance while saying. -
            &ldquo;Extraction maneuver two, ok?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that he sprints off back
            where they came from, only to disappear a few steps in, leaving a misty, cyan trail leading to the top of a
            medium sized rock, which he was now standing on, ready to lay down more covering fire if need be.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sound of explosions and bright colours in the distance cause the blonde girl to
            burst into laughter all of a sudden. She glances briefly at her companion&rsquo;s reaction and smiles along,
            though it is not pride what causes her expression, but rather the gratification one would get for pulling
            off the finest of jokes. &quot;... we should&rsquo;ve been architects...&quot;, she randomly comments in the
            middle of the chaos.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as Vuko&rsquo;s lips part to relay the suggestion, the girl clucks her tongue
            in approval and performs a back spin followed by a hand glide to get up, and uses void dash to move forward
            mirroring her partner&rsquo;s trajectory. The resulting trails of cyan blue and cherry blossom pink form a
            fancy X in the middle of the battlefield.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Kuve! You and Mr. Edgy Teen need to provide us cover against whoever comes for
            us! You can use your stupid wizard ass tricks to teleport up there afterwards&quot;, the soldier commands as
            she suddenly puts her sniper away and motions to Kapak to follow her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Here they come!&quot; He called as he turned and began to run after the soldier
            up the slope. He stopped and gripped his abdomen. &quot;Oooh... okay... maybe... not so... fast...&quot; He
            turned just as a squadron of Grineer appeared from the other end of the tunnel, from the main camp. They
            shouted and let loose their guns. Kapak kept moving up the slope, returning fire from the Grineer rifle in
            his hands as he kept limping up the slope. Bullets scraped the ground near Vuko and Kuve, sending sand
            spraying upwards and into the air.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A Grineer subthermal grenade flew through the air, beeping as it landed next to the
            two Tenno.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw the grinner coming
            in from the tunnel he sent out another fireball, but the enemies were too far away and the blast went off in
            front of them, only causing sand to fly upwards and leaving a smoke behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vuko quickly realised that their
            numbers will crush them soon enough, they weren&#39;t prepared for this, and unless they came up with an
            idea how to hold them off there are going to be casualties. - &quot;SWAP, YOU FI-&quot; - He screamed
            towards his partner trying to get through the deafening sounds of Grineer artillery, indicating the next
            part of the maneuver. The incoming grenade, however stopped him halfway through the sentence as he
            instinctively shifted his body into the void, which caused the rest of his words to go unheard. He braced
            for the impact of the explosion, even though he knew it couldn&#39;t touch him and neither should it touch
            Kuve, but he knew it could very quickly alter the terrain around him causing the ground to be swiped from
            under his feet. So he took the most stable position, spreading his balance across both legs equally and
            waited for the grenade to go off.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oooh, nice move!&quot;, she acknowledges as soon as she noticed the beeping
            item falling nearby, instinctively going into void mode and slowly making her way out of the way. She does
            not know what it will do but has always distrusted any high-pitch noise that repeats itself periodically.
            During her displacement, her eyes viciously scan the area for any enemies trying to employ any other unusual
            method to attack the soldier and Kapak as they make their way up the slope, and preparing an appropriate
            counter in her mind if that is the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Si...!&quot;, The soldier loudly exclaims as she abruptly stops on her tracks
            and turns to check on the two Tenno, feeling almost instantly relieved as they disappear from plain sight
            all of a sudden. She keeps her eyes on the spot the two were until the grenade explodes just to make sure
            they&rsquo;re not in harm&rsquo;s way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The grenade detonates, but the two Tenno are safe within the alternate reality. The
            vapor dissipates, leaving a patch of frost where the grenade had landed.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;They&#39;re fine!&quot; Kapak called to the soldier, continuing to limp upwards
            and shoot at the Grineer below. There was a clicking sound as he pulled the trigger. &quot;Kieye ot
            p&#39;tayk suykit&#39;j yusjubbpet,&quot; he cursed, &quot;Out of ammo already. What a trash weapon.&quot;
            He grabbed the gun by the barrel and flung it down forcefully, the weapon colliding with a Grineer and
            sending him skidding across the ground in a cloud of dust. Kapak&#39;s moment of rage got the better of him
            as a volley of bullets streaked across his chest, tearing open holes in a diagonal line across his torso.
            &quot;Aghhh!&quot; he groaned, fall backwards and leaning against the side of the wall. Blood poured from
            the wound, most of it bright and red, but some of it purple and almost blue looking. &quot;I muckin&#39;
            hate these Grineer so much,&quot; he managed to say as he tried to staunch the flow of crimson fluid. He
            dropped to one knee and looked up the slope. They were almost at the top.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Another batch of Grineer showed up, most of them in heavy armour with what looked
            like some kind of heavy grenade launchers. One of them shouted a command, and a flurry of missiles went
            flying towards Kuve. Before Vuko could do anything himself, there was the screaming of a jet engine from
            behind him. Some sort of Grineer in heavy, padded armour rushed at him, a large, spiked hammer in
            hand.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blonde girl perceives the attack a little too late as she was focused elsewhere
            when the missiles were launched. In a desperate move, not for her sake, for she remains in void mode, but
            for the possible consequence to the infrastructure of the place and therefore the safety of the landing
            zone, she performs a void dash through the projectiles while channeling Lightning Dash, which produces a
            ball of electricity capable to zap nearby enemies. Should the lighting hit any of the missiles in its
            course, it could cause them to detonate or malfunction depending on their composition and design.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Per Zenurik focus permutations, Kuve&rsquo;s void gauge will only allow the use of 5
            more dashes, or around 40 seconds more of continuous void mode.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the missiles charging at Kuve
            and hearing a menacing engine behind him, while also at the same time knowing that he can&#39;t stay in the
            void for much longer he makes a quick decision. Vuko decides to blindly void dash backwards, without
            checking what exactly is behind him. The jump leaves a fiery trail behind it, as Blazing dash burns a blue
            flame through whatever crosses the line.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lands next to Kapak, just after
            the streak of bullets hit his torso. Seeing that the person that he came here for might bleed out, he makes
            another rash decision. Vuko puts one of his hands at his back and the other on his torso, covering both the
            entry and exit wounds. - &quot;You&#39;re not going to like this.&quot; - He comments, trying to give the
            Nidus a heads up on what&#39;s going to happen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small fiery burst erupts from both
            of his hands, cauterizing and sealing the injuries. The force of the flames seems to be exact amount needed
            to complete the task, seeming like this is not the first time the Tenno has done it. Without waiting for
            Kapak&#39;s reaction, Drakkainen puts one of the infested arms on his shoulders, helping the giant stand up
            and continue walking up the hill.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Vuko has now drained all of his void energy and has to wait for it to
            recharge.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The Grineer Reaver who had tried to ambush Vuko stumbles as he was ignited , his
            padded armour erupting into flames- shortly after, exploding due to the fire lighting his jetpack&rsquo;s
            fuel.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kuve&rsquo;s lightning caused the payloads in the missiles to detonate prematurely,
            knocking down the Grineer Bombard squad, as well as surrounding Grineer troops.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak squirmed a little, reluctantly accepting Vuko&rsquo;s aid. &ldquo;Ugh... ahh...
            thank... you...?&rdquo; his mutant mouth grimaced, his muscles tense. &ldquo;Quite embarrassing... normally
            I can just shrug off puny bullets like that... muckin&rsquo; Grineer.... I hate fire...&rdquo; The towering
            Warframe seemed to get heavier by the second, a sign that his strength had begun to fade a bit. As they
            reached the top of the hill, Kapak&rsquo;s head perked up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming. Let&rsquo;s get ready
            to go...&rdquo; He weakly pointed to the sky, and the lights of a Landing Craft began to streak through the
            clouds.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hang in there, buddy. I&#39;m sure you have enough mucus in your swamp-like
            spaceship to patch that blob of yours&quot;, the soldier comforts while sliding the sniper behind her and
            positioning herself to support the opposite side of the Nidus. Her eyes are focused completely on the sky,
            trying to assess the remaining time before they can get out of there, and though her posture is perhaps just
            as stoic as before, she is slowly panicking inside. She feels quite useless in this scenario; fact is, she
            can&#39;t move or maneuver while wearing the wonky disguise, and because of the mask, an essential item to
            cover her identity from the other Grineer, she can&#39;t use her weapons properly either. Her best shot is
            to rely on the Tenno and the speed of Kapak&#39;s ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blonde girl smiles unseen from the void as she witness the missiles detonating
            without causing her peers the least damage. She then spots Vuko moving back to the slope and realizes, by
            the sudden outburst of void energy after his displacement and his treatment of the asset, that he probably
            is out of gas. She frowns, and quickly decides the best she can do is to buy the others some seconds.
            &quot;Time for some zippy zappy game...&quot;, she declares as she enables void singularity and void static
            on her void mode, quickly draining her remaining gauge but keeping up both permutations just enough to leave
            her with a final dash up the slope. If her attack is successful, it would continuously pull enemies within
            20 meters towards her while emitting pulses of electricity.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The Grineer Bombard Squad went flying forwards, colliding with each other as sparks
            of lightning jumped between them, being conducted along their ferrous armour. They landed unceremoniously in
            a steaming pile.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">But before any celebration could occur, another squad of Grineer appeared from the
            tunnel entrance, guns blazing.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Once we get in the... urgh... air...&quot; Kapak wheezed, &quot;We&#39;re gonna
            be fired upon by their air support. They&#39;re not shooting us now... because... COUGH... we&#39;re too
            close to their camp... COUGH. Muckin&#39; Dargyns annoying as guts. And then we gotta avoid the Fomorian....
            he&#39;s a good flyer though... all will be alright... urgh... I hate... fire...&quot; Kapak&#39;s muttering
            seemed almost nonsensical and logical at the same time, seeming like he was feverishly trying to give
            instructions. As they reached the top of the hill, Kapak&#39;s strength seemed to give up as he collapsed,
            proving too much for the Tenno to carry. The Landing Craft was slowing down, almost above them now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~A trio of Dargyns appeared &nbsp;over the horizon, firing shots at the Tenno ship.
            The tough, armoured exterior of the already strangely dented and rusty looking ship held strong- Lisets were
            built to last. However, the Dargyn in the center of the three had what appeared to be a rocket launcher
            fixed to its underside; if it got into range, there would be no way the Landing Craft would survive such a
            blow and escape with enough integrity to get them out of here.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lets go of Kapak, as he falls down
            on the ground like a sack of potatoes, face first into the sand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing the shots fired from
            above, he turns around to see the three Dargyns, trying to pull the ship out of the sky. - &ldquo;Oh
            sh-&ldquo; - He comments but the rest of his words were unheard due to a volley of shots that landed near
            him. Vuko then does a sidestep to the right, after which he rotates three hundred and sixty degrees, in the
            middle of the spin grabbing the Vulkar from his ally&rsquo;s back. At the end of the almost dance-like
            movement he takes a knee, aimed towards the Dargyns and aims the sniper.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenno has no trouble aiming
            directly at the rocket launcher, thanks to the fact that the crafts are coming almost straight at him. After
            no more than two second of aiming he fires the first shot, emitting a characteristic deep sound. The recoil
            hits him hard, barrel of the gun springing upwards, his body visibly pushed backwards. Vuko manages to
            control the rifle and aim once again and fires an ear-defeating shot, aimed at at the lower part of the
            Dargyn. This time the recoil hits him harder, causing pain in his shoulder. Due to the kick-back he is
            unable to take another shot.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shots fired from behind alarm her, prompting her to instantly look up worried for
            the safety of Vuko and the stranger. As Kuve only notices the former being pushed back all of a sudden, she
            becomes extremely anxious and uses void dash up the slope, spawning a spherical aura of pink energy flowing
            towards the highest point of its upper hemisphere. As soon as she determines her partner is shaken but
            alive, she turns back with her palm extended and facing the Dargyn in the center, noticing the rocket
            launcher underneath its pilot area barely in time to fire a beam in its direction. She is seemingly
            exhausted, as her body is clearly out of shape when it comes to executing void abilities, and her eyes are
            beginning to reflect her sleepiness.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The aura fastens the regeneration rate of both void energy and void beam gauges for
            both Tenno, though for the time being, both still have their ability pool semi-depleted.~</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~Vuko&rsquo;s first shot lands high, glancing off the Hellion Dargyn&rsquo;s upper
            shell. The second shot lands true, causing a malfunction in the rocket launcher. It snapped to the left,
            sending a missile into the Dargyn at its side. There was a bright light as the Dargyn was engulfed in flame,
            it&rsquo;s remains careening to the planet&rsquo;s surface. The Hellion Dargyn, now disarmed, tried to alter
            course, but Kuve&rsquo;s Void Beam hits it along the bottom, carving around the circumference of the ship as
            it turned until the entire bottom half was smoking and sparking. The third Dargyn broke formation, circling
            away unscathed as the Hellion Dargyn lost altitude and steering, wobbling out of control as it veered past
            the hill Vuko, Kuve and the other stood upon, exploding in the canyons behind them.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s... go...!&rdquo; Kapak struggled onto his knees, and vomited up
            another ball of blue and red fluid.&quot;Urgh... that one didn&#39;t feel so... good.&quot; Kapak wobbled on
            his limbs as the Liset descended upon the group, its rusted and flaky paintjob becoming more prevalent upon
            the warped hull of the once sleek craft.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The back of the Landing Craft opened up, a ramp descending downwards. From within,
            there was only darkness, a light fog oozing out from the lower portion of the doorway. Suddenly, a magenta
            light sparked into existence. Then another. And another. Suddenly, and without warning, a swarm of what
            seemed like thousands of infested maggots poured down the ramp, racing past the quartet, moving down the
            slope and some even flinging themselves off the cliff down to the Grineer. From below, Vuko, Kuve and the
            soldier could hear explosions and screaming Grineer, so loud that it felt like their gunfire was
            muffled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Only seconds after the wave of tiny, insect like infested creatures had been
            expelled, two ape like monsters drunkenly ran out of the ship, one holding a gas pipe, while the other one
            held a Hema rifle that was far to large for it to carry- also, it was pointing it backwards. The two
            creatures unleashed an unearthly and yet strangely adorable warcry as they ran down the slope to face the
            Grineer soldiers who were attempting to advance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, go, go,&quot; Kapak coughed, &quot;but... mask... or suffocate.&quot; A
            third infested being, almost identical, but a little taller than the previous ones shuffled down the ramp,
            carrying two bubble-shaped masks, with what looked like a backpack attached to it. It held them out
            sheepishly towards Vuko and Kuve. &quot;You... still have yours, right?&quot; Kapak turned and looked up at
            the soldier.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What the..?! - The Tenno almost
            shouts, while jumping away from a maggot that just ran past his feet. His eyes widen as he sees the flood of
            maggots and the thee monkey-like infested looking creatures. - &ldquo;The bloody actual hell are these
            things?!&rdquo; - He exclaims while pointing at one of them with his right arm, as the left one is hanging
            by his side.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts on the helmet and the
            backpack, albeit having a lot of trouble with the latter due to his damaged shoulder.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the equipment is in place,
            Vuko goes to the Nidus&rsquo; left side and helps him get up and onto the ship, by supporting part of his
            weight.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah!&quot;, she lets a scream out at the same time she jumps into Vuko&rsquo;s
            arms in despite of his shoulder pain, and hangs from his neck. The things are beyond scary to her, and quite
            disgusting, but not as much as the dark interior of the ship which represents the life boat of the
            situation. She briefly wonders if her chances are better with the weird, turtle-like soldiers arriving
            incessantly, and is about to choose this option when the soldier replies.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; ???:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;...always...&quot;, she responds with a somber tone of voice as she discreetly
            removes the Grineer mask, pulls out her own breather from one of her pouches, and angrily takes the Vulkar
            back. Her face is an exact replica of Kuve&rsquo;s, with the most subtle of details present in the exact
            same places; no additional scars have been added to this canvas in despite of the years that have passed,
            which makes her hairstyle the only element that distinguishes her from her sibling. Her hair, neatly cut
            into a shoulder-length bob, features a pronounced strand of hair dyed of pink in its fringe, and looks
            slightly messier than Kuve&rsquo;s, as if she&rsquo;s been careless about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She then places the withdrawn object on her mouth, and connects its end with an item
            hidden behind another pouch before adding: &quot;It&rsquo;s filthy, disgusting, smelly, and frankly
            vomit-inducing. It lacks any humane concept of order, and overall feels like the interior of a stomach...
            &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;... but you get used to it...?&quot;, she interrupts with a smirk as she leaves
            Vuko&rsquo;s arms and equips the breather.&quot;Right, Koya?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Never have... never will...&quot;, she complains before she makes her way up
            the ramp and into the darkness of the infested ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, let&#39;s COUGH skedaddle,&quot; Kapak shuffled to his feet, allowing
            Vuko to carry him on one side while the monkey moved to help support him on the other. Together, they all
            follow Koya into the ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The interior of the ship is pitch black. Or at least it seems that way, relative to
            the sunny outdoors of Mars. After a while, the ship&#39;s interior begins to light up as their eyes adjust
            to the dimness. The frontal viewport of the ship was half coated in pulsating, infested vines. The
            dashboards were all coated in slime covered sphincters and mushroom like tubercles. The same Magenta glow
            that weakly shone from Kapak&#39;s body could be seen mirrored throughout pustules growing along the
            ship&#39;s walls. The air inside the ship was warm, or humid to be more exact. Soft lit orange spores danced
            gently through the air, adding an slightly whimsical and sickeningly sweet beauty to the interior.~</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Set me down... there...&quot; Kapak pointed to the dashboard on the right. The
            infested creature helped Kapak settle down with Vuko in tow. Kapak turned his gaze to the upper corner of
            the ship, as if looking at something, despite it being barren. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Behind them, the
            two other infested primates returned, slightly worse for wear- one of them had a Grineer cleaver through its
            head, which it seemed to not notice. They burped and poked each other before walking over to Kapak and
            poking at his wounds.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;This is... surreal...&rdquo;
            - He says after letting go of the Nidus. - &ldquo;Do you really live here?&rdquo; - The Tenno asks, looking
            around in almost what seems like awe.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the engineer come back, Vuko
            gives them a dirty look seeing the hatchet lodged inside the head, and follows them when they come over to
            Kapak and start touching him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl dressed in white and pink cringes intensely as she walks in the ship,
            keeping her arms and legs as close to the center of her body and avoiding coming into contact with
            something. Her eyes alarmingly dash from one place to another, not with the intention of exploring but only
            as a precaution for her steps, and even though they have adjusted to the poor lightning, she still struggles
            to differentiate the objects from the walls or the ground. Her only point of reference is the silhouette of
            Vuko&rsquo;s body and the sound of his walking as he moves forward; she is almost blinded otherwise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&rsquo;t even try, your eyes can&rsquo;t see anything in here, no matter how
            hard you try. Just wait for the link to provide you with my memorized layout of the place&quot;, the other
            blonde girl advises as she moves unfazed around the place and reaches the navigation console. She no longer
            seems focused on keeping up her previous stoic posture and now her back is slightly arched outwards,
            accentuating the curvature of her waistline and the slimness of her torso. &quot;We need to contact Kedh,
            she&rsquo;s been working for the Corpus for almost as long as I have worked for the Grineer. I&rsquo;m sure
            the both of us will be enough to give you a general idea of what&rsquo;s happened while you slept... Kapak,
            how are you holding up?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He coughed again. &quot;Never better,&quot; he replied to Koya. As Vuko watched the
            apes poke at Kapak&#39;s body, it becomes clear they have no idea what they are doing. They seem to be
            curious rather than helpful. Kapak doesn&#39;t seem to mind. &quot;Ah, Vuko... just wait until... you see my
            Orbiter...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He slammed the control panel he was leaning against and bellowed, &quot;LET&#39;S GET
            A MOVE ON THEN, EH?!&quot; before falling into a coughing fit.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ramp closed behind them, the ship rocking and shifting as it started to fly
            forwards and upwards. From within the walls of the Liset, they could hear what sounded like water sloshing,
            as well as the creaking and grinding of metal as if the ship threatened to break apart. &quot;Hold onto your
            hoods,&quot; Kapak wheezed from the floor with a chuckle.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;So... you two haven&#39;t found Kayn or Kili...&quot;, the blonde girl
            nervously whispers all of a sudden in what is near-absolute darkness to both girls; she keeps her balance in
            despite of the ship&#39;s movement thanks to her left arm firmly holding one of the few solid items in the
            ship while her right hand kneads her temple. Her mind and memory have begun to sync properly with her
            sister&#39;s now, and the resulting flooding of information is making her head palpitate painfully. At
            first, she whimpers briefly and silently, trying to repress the sudden burst of perceived pressure on her
            skull, but then the pain becomes unbearable and her whimpering gets louder and louder, until she falls to
            the floor with both hands aggressively grabbing her head and her gritted teeth visibly quavering. Sweat soon
            covers her forehead, and her entire body seemingly spasms as her previous complains become loud screams
            filling the limited space of the spaceship.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Focus... &quot;, her sibling responds with a detached tone of voice without
            turning her head from the console. Her posture remains somewhat calm but she too has raised her right hand
            to knead her temple. Her eyes are now closed, and her upper teeth are also pressing against the lower ones,
            but despite her facial expression revealing her struggle, no noise comes out her mouth. Her breathing and
            heartbeat are accelerated, but she manages to keep herself steady in despite of it. Soon, blood begins to
            pour out of both sisters&#39; nostrils.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ship lifts off suddenly, Vuko
            is thrown off his balance for a moment and catches himself by using one of the walls as a support.
            Immediately he takes his hand off the wall, as he got his hand covered in some sort of green slimy
            substance, and tries to shake it off. After a moment he looks at one of the infested creatures and decides
            to use its back as a towel, and cleans his glove by smearing the slime on an engineer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Kuve first whimper and then
            fall on her knees, Drakkainen almost immediately jumps to her side, and puts his arms around her, trying to
            calm her down. - &ldquo;Shhhhh... it&rsquo;ll be okay..&rdquo; - He says in a soothing voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vuko then turns his head, facing
            Koya, while still hugging Kuve. - &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Did you do this?!&rdquo; - He asks in an
            angry and demanding voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;She&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Kapak whispered as loudly as he could from the floor.
            &quot;There&#39;s nothing that could happen to her that I won&#39;t COUGH be able to fix. Just... keep those
            masks on...&quot; The Engineer screeched in annoyance at Vuko but turned back to Kapak.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">~The interior lit up as Grineer Dargyn fire lit up the air in front of them. They
            were warning shots. To Vuko and Kuve&#39;s surprise, who likely did not expect such technology to still be
            operational, a holographic communications screen blipped into existence in front of them all.~</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vay Hek:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;TENNO!! YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY VALUABLE TO ME! SOMETHING THAT WOULD GREATLY
            BENEFIT THE GRINEER EMPIRE, AND YOU DARE STEAL IT FROM US??!!&quot; An old, wrinkled Grineer face attached
            to a mess of machinery screamed at them. &quot;YOU... MAGGOTS!! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE GRINEER COULD HAVE
            ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE MONEY FROM THAT INFESTED FOOL??!! IMAGINE HUNDREDS OF MY FOMORIANS SWEEPING ACROSS THE
            SYSTEM, RESTORING ORDER TO ALL!! BUT YOU HAD TO GET YOUR FILTHY TENNO HANDS ON MY PRIZE!! LAND YOUR SHIP
            IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!! OR ELSE MY FOMORIAN WILL SHOW YOU NO MERCY!!! CONSIDER YOURSELF
            WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hate... that guy...&quot; Kapak spat out a gob of mucus, pushing a button to
            sever communications. &quot;Hold on now.... he COUGH isn&#39;t joking about showing us no mercy!&quot; The
            ship turned violently to the left, then back to the right, evading all manner of projectiles being shot at
            them. The windshield became a blinding flash of orange as the Fomorian&#39;s eye fired a deadly laser, but
            the ship dipped downwards just in time to dodge it completely. &quot;Faster!! COUGH COUGH&quot; Kapak kept
            hammering the side of the console he leaned against with his fist. The ship went vertical, the walls
            rattling as the ship&#39;s engines were pushed to their limit. Before they knew it, the blue skies of the
            Grineer Martian colony were gone, replaced by nothing but the darkness of space as they pulled away from the
            planet.(edited)</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re way ahead of them now,&quot; Kapak continued to wheeze from the floor
            as the rattling of the ship stopped. &quot;My... orbiter is at Phobos. Out of Grineer airspace. They will
            COUGH lose us now anyways... we just look like another derelict COUGH COUGH ship COUGH ahem, excuse... me...
            floating through space.&quot; The silence, aside from the hum of the Liset&#39;s engines was deafening; in
            contrast to the ruckus they had just escaped from, the scene was as silent as space itself. Kapak turned
            back to the two Tenno and Koya. &quot;Apologies for making everything seem to... move so... fast... COUGH
            but I can assure you questions will be... answered COUGH on my ship COUGH COUGH. How is she?&quot; He
            gestured to Kuve.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quick maneuvering of the ship does not seem to faze her, other than bestowing
            upon her the expected motion sickness. Her nose is no longer bleeding, but the trails of dry blood are still
            present like bridges connecting her nostrils to her upper lip, and its metallic taste is making its presence
            known to her taste buds. The projection of Vay Hek seems to be what alarmed her the most, but she knows her
            identity was not revealed to any soldier who could have possibly remained alive. Still, the anxiety of
            working as a spy has never gone away, and chronically threatens her nervous system after every mission,
            which is apparent now by her facial expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blonde girl in the Grineer outfit does not seem to pay attention to Vuko&#39;s
            question, or her sister even. She limits herself to approach Kapak and place an arm on one of his shoulders
            for stability. &quot;Get us there, Kap. And she is fine... anyone would feel overwhelmed by receiving years
            worth of experiences...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Tenno who had been thrashing on the ground out of both the ship&#39;s movement
            and her mental overflow becomes suddenly static at the same the hologram makes an appearance. She is
            exhausted, and her head aches; her body seemingly weights more than her muscles can carry, and her eyes are
            still as blinded as before, and yet, something new and different has illuminated the room: a face, a
            magnificent one that seems carefully sculpted by the most vicious and ambitious artists.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She does not understand all of what its roughened and imposing lips are releasing,
            but the few words that make it into her conscious listening are distilled with such an exotic and exquisite
            intonation that makes her euphoric and joyful. Its powerful presence has an intrinsic air of absolute
            authority that sends her spine intense chills as its invasive eyes and mouth that pierce her heart and
            assault her nervous system with poetry, respectively.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her heart cannot take it, her body and mind demand in unison to pursue this feeling,
            and she makes her decision: whoever this is, wherever he is, she will look for him, she will find him, and
            she will marry him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who... is that...&quot;, the girl asks with a weak, but deeply dazzled
            voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still kneeling next to his
            partner, he turns around to see the rejected skingraft of a face belonging to Vay Kek. The sight of him
            instilles Vuko with not fear or anger, but pity, as he tries to intimidate everyone aboard the vessel. -
            &quot;I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s a fan of yours, eh Kapak?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenno then turns back to Kuve,
            only to see her staring at the potato-looking grineer. - &quot;Void dammit. Not again&quot; - He mutters
            under his nose, as she speaks out, in her weak, high pitched voice. - &quot;She&#39;s fine.&quot; - He
            answers the Nidus, in a very much annoyed tone. - &quot;And no worries about the high speeds and sharp
            turns, we&#39;re used to it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s Grineer Councillor Vay Hek. He COUGH COUGH is an absolute nutcase.
            You&#39;ll learn... about... him... more as we go.&quot; The Nidus leaned his head back against the wall
            with his mouth wide open, exhaling weakly. &quot;Let&#39;s hope... this body lasts until we get... there...
            would hate to COUGH COUGH COUGH have to COUGH grow yet another.&quot; Soon enough, the space the ship flew
            through was filled with rocks and asteroids as they neared the system&#39;s asteroid belt. Ahead of them, a
            massive space boulder; Phobos.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Prepare the... docking sequence...&quot; Kapak managed to say. He turned to
            Vuko and lifted a limp arm. &quot;Keep that mask on, please. I would... rather you not perish just after
            trying to find you two for nearly 3 months. COUGH COUGH&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Outside the window, a Tenno Orbiter uncloaked, filling the viewport with its massive
            bulk. It seemed to be as rust covered and dented as the Liset they flew in. &quot;Here we are,&quot; Kapak
            coughed, &quot;prepare to board.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Engineers looked at the three with heads tilted, as if to ask, &#39;are you
            ready?&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Koya:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah...&quot;, she replies in unison with her sister without looking at the
            tiny minions.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Kuve:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah...&quot;, the blonde girl says as she stands up and flexes her left
            arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Vuko:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &ldquo;Wait.. you&rsquo;ve been
            looking for us for 3 months?!&rdquo; - He says, trying to comprehend their reasoning behind this search,
            only for his attention to be diverted to the orbiter. Vuko grabs one of the parts of the craft that are not
            completely covered in infestation, expecting a rough stop.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kapak:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Eager to sate your hunger for knowledge, hmm?&quot; Kapak chuckled as heartily
            as he could before coughing his brains out again. &quot;I assure you, you questions shall be answered. Much
            has changed, since you&#39;ve slept, my friend. You... will learn.* The ship rocked slightly, and with a
            metallic clang, the Liset swiftly docked with the front of the Tenno ship. The ramp to the main Orbiter
            compartment at the back of the Landing Craft began to descend, &nbsp;steam hissing forth as pressure
            adjusted.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Welcome aboard, my friends.&quot;</span></p>
