        >[Open RP]<br />(Venus trading outpost, Dunged Frostleaf pub)<br />[2/15
        AR 23:36]<br /><br />~There are many holes where one can hide on this
        little stretch of space. Some look for those holes to hide their pain or
        just to shun away from society to do shady business. Whatever the
        reason, those that dwell in such darkness probably know of one little
        corner on Venus, where the atmosphere is dim, where you can enjoy a
        glass of your favourite beverage and nobody asks you about your
        business. Welcome to the &#39;&#39;Kuppek ppoypkeap&#39;&#39; (Dunged
        Frostleaf) pub. The moto of this &#39;esteemed&#39; establishment is
        simple &#39;&#39;You come, you mind yo business, you live&#39;&#39;<br /><br />Finding
        such a legally questionable pub sounds like a tough deal but it would
        only take just a walk away from the main hustle and bustle of the
        outpost and in to the mish mash of dull lit streets. A poster with a
        frostleaf with a steaming pile of shit on top of it hangs above the
        doorstep, signalling the entrance ~<br /><br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c4">Sonera</span
      ><span class="c0"
        ><br />A digital bell like sound rings out as the door to the pub is
        opened, nobody really pays in any intention as it&#39;s more a call to
        the barman than to the corner hugging customers. A very short and nimble
        figure steps in, all dressed up in dark close fitting robes which look
        like their owner ran through spikes recently, her face covered up by a
        childish grineer mask. The figure stands by the entrance for a moment,
        scanning the surrounding.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0"
        >The inside of the bar is small but cosy with a handful of people
        chatting about with their group or some just sitting in corners and
        drinking in peace. There are many wooden tables lined up across the
        middle of the floor while soft cushy booths hug along the left wall of
        the room for the more gropey types. The bar is located right of the
        entrance with stools accompanying it which almost occupy the entire
        side. Past the tables at the opposite side of the entrance is a small
        staircase coiling up to a second floor which most regulars know as the
        general &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; area. The lighting of the establishment is
        purposely dim, giving it a chilling vibe as if one just walked in to a
        murder scene. There is a hushed rhythmic hum playing in the background
        of something akin to a classical beat, breathing some life in to this
        room. The general smell of the pub is a mix of alcohol, old wood and
        sour metal, probably the cause of the old building that had it&#39;s
        last checkup 50 years ago.<br /><br />The masked figure looks towards
        the bar and walks towards it. There is a big screen mounted up, behind
        it, for everyone to see if they wished, but it did not broadcast a game
        or a show, it in fact showed a cephalon. The octagon shaped projection
        twirled towards the approaching customer and with a flicker of orange
        lights spoke up</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c4"
        >&ldquo;[Corpus] Welcome to the Dunged Frostleaf, I am Cephalon Palak,
        your bartender for the night. What is your taste?&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c10"
        ><br /><br />The masked and tattered figure peeks out, standing on toes </span
      ><span class="c4">&ldquo;Mapriqo liquor please?&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c10"><br /><br />&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c4">[Corpus]Coming right up!&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c10"
        ><br /><br />The Cephalon took a spin around on it&#39;s axis, as if
        happy, and from the door at the back of the bar came a moa accompanied
        by a scavenger drone. The mechanical creatures stopped in front of the
        figure and the drone dipped down the bar to fetch a glass, flying up and
        gently putting it on the counter. The moa dips it&#39;s head and poured
        the desired drink in to the glass from it&#39;s modified muzzle, careful
        not to stir and cause too much foam. <br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c4"
        >&ldquo;[Corpus]Please enjoy your stay with us&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c0"
        ><br /><br />The Cephalon ads as the moa heads back through the door,
        the scavenger drone adding a little umbrella in the glass before backing
        away from the bar to loom in case it&#39;s needed. <br /><br />The
        figure grabs hold of the glass and nods towards the Cephalon as a
        thanks. She turns around towards the room and leans with a elbow on the
        counter for that cool effect &ndash; which only made her look silly as
        she&rsquo;s obviously too short to reach the counter with her elbow. Her
        clouded eyes scan the crowd for something.</span

      ><span class="c0"
        ><br />The digital bell sounds again, betraying the silent entrance of a
        curious woman. She wore a tight, grey bodysuit of some sort of carbon
        weave underneath sections of light-weight alloy armour. The pieces of
        dull white protection guarded her breast and lower legs, along with
        parts on her arm and elbows. Her face was hidden behind a white helmet
        that fit to her head, unlike the typical bulky corpus fashion. It
        featured a neon light-blue visor with a pentagonal shape in the middle
        and two slits coming out at diagonal angles, and one slit leading down
        towards her mouth. A single cepstra resided on her hip.<br /><br />The
        newcomer walked slowly up to the bar with a relaxed and sauntering step,
        inconspicuously scanning the tables in her peripherals for something.
        The woman plopped down on a seat at the counter and turned her attention
        to the screen, waiting for the cephalon to serve her. She seemed to have
        not noticed the girl in dark robes next to her.</span

        ><br />My ears tingle along with the bell which announce the appearance
        of someone but I don&rsquo;t turn my head to grab a look at the
        newcomer, instead I slightly lift my mask up to free my mouth but still
        keeping most of my face in it&rsquo;s shadow&hellip;apart from the dark
        markings on my chin. I take a sip off my liquor and quickly scan the
        customers in the pub with dull forest green eyes. <br /><br />There are
        three off duty miners occupying one of the tables closer to the
        entrance, they talk in hushes between themselves, probably about their
        daily struggles. There is a lonesome guy sitting in one of the booths
        with four emphty glasses on &nbsp;the table in front of him. Four
        hoodlums sitting round a table closer to the staircase, they argue and
        laugh as they play cards with stacks of credits next to each of them.
        Finally, there is a old woman, seemingly passed out on &nbsp;the bar.
        <br /><br />I frown </span

        >&rdquo;Not here&hellip;he told me it&rsquo;s today!&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c10"
        >&nbsp;I grit my teeth and whip around to face the bar just as the
        figure sat down next to me. I subtly glance towards her from the corner
        of my eye, my gaze flowing from her hooded head to her boots. </span
      ><span class="c3"
        >&rdquo;Nice curves&hellip;but&hellip;it&rsquo;s that asking for
        trouble?&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c10"
        >&nbsp;I think, gazing at her cestra for a second. With a shrug I lean
        towards her and whisper <br /><br />&ldquo;</span

        for now, and if you got a hint of frost-leaf that&rsquo;d be good too,
        [Corpus]&rdquo; the woman declared in a modulated voice. Her speech was
        garbled enough to obscure the sound of her real voice, yet not to the
        extent that it sounded unnatural.<br /><br />Upon hearing the little
        girl&rsquo;s voice, the lady whipped around to face her. She paused for
        a moment, studying the child with a masked expression (quite literally).
        <br /><br />&ldquo;[Corpus] I know hun, but this time is a special case.
        [Corpus]&rdquo; she responded in her natural light-hearted tone,
        swinging her legs around to bring her body to face the girl. She cocked
        her head slightly. &ldquo;[Corpus] Here for&hellip; a drink?
        [Corpus]&rdquo;<br /><br />Seeing little girls enter bars such as this
        one was not something the lady hadn&rsquo;t seen before, but definitely
        was something she wasn&rsquo;t used to. Usually the kids able to strut
        around wherever they want could do so because they were related to some
        top-brass. No one would dare rebuke a child belonging to someone like
        the vice-president of Karyo Corp, but one would more than gladly keep an
        inflated tab. Of course, that meant this woman would also have to watch
        her own mouth too.</span

        that&rsquo;s been silently floating in the back whizzed towards the
        counter and dipped down to fetch a glass, bringing it up to gently put
        in front of the lady before backing out to fetch something else. At the
        same time a Railgun Moa came forth from the back door and stomped
        towards the counter, it lowers it&rsquo;s modified muzzle towards the
        glass and gently pours the desired drink from it. It takes two steps
        backwards and waits. Just then the scavenger drone comes flying back
        with a piece of frostleaf and plops it down in the glass.<br /><br /></span

        there is a Tekko and a normal Tigris.<br /><br />The duo walk over to

        from &ldquo;Damn void demons&rdquo; to &ldquo;Fucking Billy&rdquo; Who
        is Billy? Heck If I know!<br /><br />The boy and Atlas sit down by the

        counter comes flying towards the table, picking up the miners abandoned

        It returns to the table with a pair of glasses, accompanied by a Moa
        which fills the two glasses with some glowing green liquid.<br /><br />The
        boy snags one of the glasses and downs it, slamming the glass down<br /><br />&ldquo;Ahhh!

        whirring as he moved; the unmistakable sound of his exoskeleton.<br />&ldquo;Kill

        serious.<br />&ldquo;I take my work very seriously, Geordie. I&rsquo;m

        finish the job.&rdquo;<br />...<br />Of course, if and when Geordie
        looks down to see what weapon Cyrus was threatening him with, he would
        see only one gun; the finger gun.<br />Cyrus released Geordie with a

        slapped his pants, &ldquo;oh man! Your face! Hahaha! Chill out man, I

        &quot;W-wait...&quot;<br />Then he looked down and saw Cyrus&#39; finger
        gun, and his face went on a journey of expressions starting with
        terrified and moving through startled, confused, and relieved. &quot;Oh
        my void, you got me!&quot; he said, finding the laughter contagious.
        &quot;I was worried I&#39;d have to give you an elevator-pitch sob

        wasn&rsquo;t like the woman was mortified of all Tenno. She just
        hadn&rsquo;t run into many&hellip; particularly mature ones in her past

        heading towards the door of the Dunged Frostleaf. Stopping outside of
        it, he swings his powerful weapon back for more momentum, aiming to slam
        it against the frame of the door and crumble it.~</span

        route to rescuing as many as he could. He stuck out an elbow and busted
        through, landing in a roll as best he could in the room he found himself

        Tenno, who landed back on the floor with a loud thud. Her light blue
        fire cracks loud in furry as her head cranes to look towards the Volt.
        She lifts her hand to fire a bolt towards him but before she could a
        blue blur flies towards her, crashing in to her right side, throwing her
        on the floor.<br /><br />The blue blur, as it appears, is none other
        than Sonera&rsquo;s Wukong that tackled the Ember to the floor and is
        now on top of her, holding her in a intense hug so tightly that the
        Ember struggled against it, unable to break free. In pure annoyance her

        anything, she&rsquo;s still held tightly in my embrace despite her
        increasing her fire with each passing second. I still absorb most of it
        but it&rsquo;s not helping the establishment any, it&rsquo;s soon to

        from the door and the flames. And stands there, looking through it for a

        series of mechanical whirrs, as if talking to the wall, but nothing
        happens. Annoyed it stands up on it&rsquo;s hind legs as it starts
        tapping across the wall with it&rsquo;s front ones, looking for

        people out of the range of possible falling debris. Glancing around, he
        realized Cyrus and his brother were nowhere in sight. Shit!<br /><br />Orange-gold
        sparks danced around his feet once again as he parkour&#39;d back up the

        Spotting his nullifier bubble, he called out over the flames.
        &quot;Cyrus! This place is about to be leveled! You need to get
        moving!&quot;<br /><br />Geordie tried to extend his speed boost to the
        two prodman brothers, but found the nullifier in the way. &quot;Not much

        when the upper floor caved in, but he ducked down and covered his neck
        with his hands when he felt the rush of heat. He glanced back, watching
        the inferno rage behind him, praying that Cyrus, Halcyon, and anyone
        else left inside had made it out in time. Calculating how much he could
        do to help, he decided to quickly attend to the crispy tenno first.<br /><br />Quickly,
        he lifted the tenno and moved him to a spot with more snow, packing it
        around his burns to cool them and keep the flesh from getting damaged
        any further. He motioned the hooligans over. &quot;What are your

        He swore, turning to stare at the remains of the frostleaf. He
        hadn&#39;t seen Cyrus and the others make it out! Frantically, he pulled
        out a scanner and searched for the silhouettes of the others from the

        &quot;This Tenno is &nbsp;with me. Let me take care of him.&quot;<br /><br />Without

        carried him back to where the Wukong was struggling to stand.
        &quot;Okay, I got him, what do you want me to do? He&#39;s burnt to a

        falter. He looked around frantically for anyone else he could trust to

      <span class="c4">Sonera</span
      ><span class="c10"
        ><br />I pause as the Volt mentioned a Rhino, the tops of my fingertips
        running cold from the new found information </span
      ><span class="c3"
        >&rdquo;Ah! He was there&hellip;bad&hellip;very day!</span
      ><span class="c10"
        >&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Ahhh&hellip;.well&hellip;they are a follower
        of a cult I kind of &nbsp;am errr&hellip;stalking&rdquo;<br /><br />I
        nod towards where the Volt carried the charred Tenno to<br /><br />&ldquo;He
        was part of it but tried to escape from em&hellip;guess she was coming
        to drag him back&rdquo;<br /><br />I lift my left hand to scratch my
        cheek in a nervous manner. They&rsquo;ve become bolder than I
        remember&hellip;never thought they&rsquo;d do something in public like
        that. The game is changing! Of course I&rsquo;m not really sharing the
        entire truth but for a couple of randoms I&rsquo;ve met at the bar this
        should be enough. </span
      ><span class="c3"
        >&rdquo;No need to twirl them in to this, yes? No need, no need, already
        complicated!&rdquo;</span
      ><span class="c0"
        ><br /><br />I lift my emerald eyes towards them all and smile, nodding
        my head as I say in my hyper voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
        the kind to let anyone go.&rdquo;<br /><br />I will walk ahead of them
        as we head towards the infested room. Upon opening the gang will see the
        previous seen Charger and Ancient trying to put the Wukong in the chair,
        lifting the frames hands and legs to put them in place.<br /><br />As I
        walk past the Ancient on the left, I tap him on the back and continue
        down towards the med bay.</span

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0"
        ><br />The infested room is just as any you&rsquo;d see in the Orbiter,
        apart from the sprinkles across the ceiling and the peculiar
        concentration of a wide variety of noggles just lined up on any flat
        surface in the room excluding the glass floor. I quickly reach to scoop
        up the noggles that have been put along the cracked med bed and gently
        put them on the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;Errr&hellip;.you can put her
        down here&rdquo;<br /><br />I motion &nbsp;towards the bed
        <br /><br />&ldquo;No worry, won&rsquo;t hurt, just scan and try to
        heal&rdquo;<br /><br />I tell her.</span

        there&#39;s no way they&#39;re gonna let this slide. I didn&#39;t mind
        helping but if this is going to be an ongoing thing, I&#39;d like to
        duck out while I still can.&quot;</span

      <span class="c4">Enya:</span
      ><span class="c0"
        ><br />Enya fidgeted nervously in Cyrus&rsquo;s arms. She wanted to get
        away from the Tenno as soon as possible. They seemed like decent people,
        but she knew far better than to judge so quickly. Some of them could
        smile to the very moment they left you for dead.<br /><br />It
        wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant mindset, but one she was too scared to live
        without.</span

        upon entering the room. &quot;Nowhere near as nasty as his, but still
        just as icky!&quot; Cyrus brought Enya to rest inside the little pod.<br />&quot;I
        wonder why K- um, Captain Puck doesn&#39;t use this thing instead of
        cutting you open and stitching you up with your own meat,&quot; Cyrus
        said offhandedly to his brother.<br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1">Halcyon:</span
      ><span class="c10"
        ><br />&quot;Probably because his is already filled with infested meat.
        Putting someone in there on his ship would be the equivalent of shoving
        someone into a giant stomach!&quot; he chuckled heartily.<br /><br /></span

      ><span class="c0"
        ><br />He frowned for a moment, then turned his attention to Geordie.<br />&quot;Gonna
        leave? Well, I guess most the excitement&#39;s died down for now, thank
        goodness. This was really supposed to be a relaxing day for us, but oh
        well. Tell you what, friendo! I&#39;ll give you our comm channel
        passcode so you can hit us up anytime! Just send a transmission when you
        need our help with stuff! Or if you just want to hang out, watch some

        so, seat up, heal up, wild day for sure! I don&rsquo;t have liquor but I
        have maprico juice! ON THE HOUSE!&rdquo;<br /><br />I lift my hand up,
        waving it at the infested specters as they finally set my Wukong atop
        the chair. They then quickly scurry outside.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hit me up
        with your locations, will bounce you there. AFTER! We play a round of
        &ldquo;guess the picture&rdquo; EH?!&rdquo;<br /><br />I smile, almost

        Someone else to play with!</span
