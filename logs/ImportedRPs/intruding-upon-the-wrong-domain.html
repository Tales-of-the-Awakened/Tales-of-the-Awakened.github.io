        About a mile out over a ridge overlooking Orokin Remnant HQ-<br />- 3/29

        This was Rast, a mercenary Excalibur with a corpus background fully
        kitted out with his obsolete Karak lay beside him, a bulky misshapen lex
        on his leg and a old chipped Paragon Sword on his back along with an
        assortment of other utility based kit along his belt.~<br /><br />~He
        had only just arrived and had been watching intently the last five mins
        eyeing the apparent hangar for signs of life or of anything remotely
        active&hellip; Nothing had caught his eye yet~<br /><br />*

        growled&hellip;* <br /><br />* He had been on this job for his
        benefactor whom had been particular interest in this signal&hellip; Rast
        had been tracking the signal mostly on foot for some days now. A rather
        slow a painful process in the low gravity of the moon, forcing him to
        almost hop and skip his way across and how the signal bounce from place
        to place didn&#39;t help either, constantly misleading him to either
        abandoned complexes, ships, craters and an notable amount of
        junk&hellip; *<br /><br /></span

        he thought the exactly same thing a few times already and they had
        turned out empty. Yet they was something slightly odd to this hangar
        hidden away and if it was not for the dim signal he had been following
        he doubted he would have known it was there at all.</span

        and all this moonwalking was starting to make his stomach churn&hellip;
        Still the view behind him was very nice&hellip; Taking his eyes off the

        the middle of it all, a massive spacecraft; a Tenno Orbiter. Surrounding
        it were piles and piles of scrap metal, as well as small fires lit here
        and there, melting down unwanted materials and other waste, bathing the
        cavern in an orange glow.<br />The Orbiter itself was covered in dents,
        its paint job extremely scratched, and it&rsquo;s metal hull warped
        almost as if some huge god had picked it up and squeezed it like
        putty.<br />Perhaps the most curious thing, and possibly alarming, were
        the tentacles. Along the side of the ship, there was a massive hole with
        scorched edges, obvious evidence that something big had taken a shot at
        the spacecraft. But from within the hole, large and long gray infested
        tendrils writhed, picking up and moving pieces of the scrap metal in a
        very deliberate, machine-like manner, sorting the various pieces of
        metal into piles and such.<br />As Rast continues to observe the scene,
        he spots the three figures which he had been hunting. He can now clearly
        see that they were carrying a piece of hull in the light of the cavern,
        but he still couldn&rsquo;t quite make out what they were. The large
        metal plate blocked his view of them from his current position.</span

        machine, if you could even call it that. It was a mount of twisted flesh
        and metal, a bizarre amalgamation of machinery and muscle. Whatever it
        was, it is obvious that it was once Corpus; a Crewman helmet stuck out
        at its side, majority of it wrapped in thin, black veins. On the top
        part of this object was a twisted, malformed Corpus arm. It gripped a
        hammer in its grasp, slamming away forcefully on a sheet of metal lying
        across the top like an anvil, smoothing out the salvage into a more
        uniform, flattened piece of plating.<br />It was a noisy machine,
        constantly emanating a loud metallic clang with every swing of the
        mallet, accompanied by the gurgling of whatever bodily fluids were
        flowing within.</span

        >Rast watches, the three figures finally dumping their piece of metal
        down on the ground before splitting up and disappearing off to do other
        things. It&#39;s still difficult for him to fully make them out due to
        shadows caused by the fires, but he is close enough to realize that they
        are in fact, very, very short. <br />After they leave, Rast may be able
        to notice another machine next to the one made of Corpus body parts.
        This machine looked like an octopus slightly, with a pulsating, veiny,
        bulbous head. On one side, a &#39;jaw&#39; stuck out, its
        &#39;fangs&#39; made of metal. Within its mouth, a swirling vat of
        molten ferrite can be seen, its orange glow lighting up the flesh of the
        creature from the inside out. Periodically, the head of the machine
        split open at the sides, unveiling a set of mechanical limbs that picked
        up pieces of metal from a nearby pile, shoving them into its
        &quot;mouth&quot; where they were melted down for something. As Rast
        observes, he may also observe a chute emerging from the backside of the
        creature; every 10 seconds or so, an orange pellet of ferrite was spat
        out, perfectly rectangular. There was now a pile of cooling metal next
        to the machine.<br />Suddenly, a barking sound rang out throughout the
        cavern. It sounded just like a Kubrow, but something about it seemed
        off. Soon, a second barking joined in, a duet of angry cries ringing
        out.</span

        Orokin architecture. Golden rays of the sun beamed through the glass
        dome above. He looked down at his hands, finding them as golden as the
        pristine area he stood in. In one arm he held a curious device that he
        found himself plugging into a console mounted to the platform. Whatever
        it was doing, it finished it pretty quickly, and his view was shifted to
        another platform along the side of the room a couple meters away. And
        then he took in the full outlook on the room, noticing dozens of
        platforms lining the circular walls in layers all the way down the tall
        room. In the middle there stood a gigantic column of circuitry and
        brilliant lights that spanned from the ceiling all the way down to the
        ground.<br /><br />He frantically jumped from platform to platform. Each
        one held two, four, or even sometimes six consoles. Something needed to
        be unstuck in one of the drives, but he couldn&rsquo;t quite find out
        where. Only 20% extracted, sentients knocking on their doorstep, and no
        cephalon to help. Their? That&rsquo;s right, he had a friend. A friend?
        He paused for a minute and glanced towards the entrance. Through the
        jammed-open door, he could see someone carving through battalysts in the
        hallway. Smoke poured out of the opening as enemies were lit ablaze. The
        figure wielded a familiar looking shotgun, blasting sentient bone marrow
        across the corridor.<br /><br />He came to his senses, his mind becoming
        sharper and clearer within the lucid dream. He turned towards his ally
        and held out his arm, trying to touch his friend. He staggered forward.
        He was so close...</span

        terms with struck afresh at his mind. They trickled slowly down his
        cheek. Instinctively, the Tenno brought his arm up to his face to wipe
        it. The action reminded him that he was still in his warframe, however,

        of his eye. The ridable kubrow lifts his head from the floor to look
        down the corridor just to see a box slightly move. With a curious tilt
        of his head he looks back to his play companion and will let out a low
        gruff. With scurrying strides the beast approaches the box and lowers
        his head to viciously sniff around it. Rast is lucky that the
        infestation in the air and the apparatus on the kubrows muzzle is
        interfering with his sense of smell.<br /><br />Curious as ever, he will
        lightly nudge the box with his horn and let out a sharp exhale though

        silently saying &ldquo;I got chu bro!&rdquo; He throws the rest of the
        cracker in his gluttonous maw and gulps it down without chewing. The
        messy haired boy throws a glance at his kubrow and nods. The companion
        just looks at him with a &ldquo;wtf?&rdquo; look on his furry face, not
        really understanding what he&rsquo;s supposed to do.<br /><br />Without
        a warning, Devros lifts his left leg in the air and slams it down right
        in front of the Excalibur, in between his legs to both surprise and
        shock him. Devros regrets the action imidetly since his leg hasn&rsquo;t
        fully healed from the previous engagement but he doesn&rsquo;t let the
        pain show on his face. He leans in with the elbow of his left arm on top
        of the semi-crouched leg, his forehead almost touching the Excals helm.
        The boys expression is furrowed in to a complete stern stare as if
        he&rsquo;s looking at the guy that took the last egg from the fridge
        &ndash; which in Devros&rsquo; world is just as bad as killing a
        innocent child.</span

        least... <br /><br />&quot;I was just a simple surveillance that all it
        was... Low credits, mineral profile... They are many places on the moon
        that haven&#39;t been fully explored you don&#39;t know what might lurk
        in the shadows ready to pounce... &nbsp;This is the sort of routine
        tedious boring mission that any &#39;higher&#39; Tenno would

        Rast explained calmly that was more along the lines of the truth but not
        the hole... Rast had on purposely withheld his &#39;employer&#39;... For
        all he know it was the only real piece of information that was keeping
        him alive... <br /><br />&quot;Is he friendly? Can I say hello?&quot;
        Rast nodded to the kubrow suppressing his own fear and curiosity the
        best he could.<br />Once again Rast tried to buy time by redirecting the
        conversation... A long shot to be sure.<br /><br />(( </span
