        strange signal that he had stumbled upon. The transmission continued to
        play in his mind as he pondered it. who had sent it? What was it trying
        to say? Keeping his bow at the ready, he came upon the corpses of fallen
        warframes, looking them over as he went. His heart began to race at the
        sight wondering who could have eliminated so many tenno. The music
        playing in his ear slowed, his heart rate dropping with it, causing him
        to regain his composure. <br /><br />He trod lightly, surprised there
        weren&rsquo;t any traps laid out given the amount of casualties were
        spread about. Walking down the hall for a while he reached the room
        where the signal was emanating from. Peering inside he saw a console
        sitting alone and moved towards it. Once at the console, he looked it
        over attempting to find any traces of who had sent the signal.</span

        the current planet we are currently going after. If we shut the rails
        down, that gives us several weeks to capture each planet without fear of

        closest orbit to earth, it will take a Grineer galleon fifty six days to
        reach us. Therefore, if we keep a small band of Tenno on a given
