The empty space is a perfect medium in revealing everything in its inky grasp. However, the black between still manages to hide many things to this day. One of them is a small space station, floating far from the view of any planet or moon. You would never find it unless you were looking for it, and knew where it was. Now, some Tenno, their fortune or lack thereof soon to be determined, are aiming to enter its hidden halls. 

These selected Tenno, whom had recently applied to work for the Corporation, received a follow-up message within 48 hours.

A myriad of lights flickered in the darkness of space. 

Any way of looking into cold structure they thrived upon was blocked by tightly shut blinds: the eyelids of a sleeping giant. Well, not a giant exactly. In fact, it was quite small. Suspiciously so. Shards of metal upon its exterior cut outwards into the inky black at odd angles. They were accompanied by doors exposed to the vacuum of space, seething with burning red lights. Despite this, the lonely station’s clean Corpus design strangely showed no beatings from the outside.

Tall flood lamps stood upon a flat, empty protrusion of the building, presumably a drop-off zone, as they fought valiantly against the overwhelming atmosphere of eeriness around it. Perhaps in some eyes they had failed their mission, only serving to spread the uneasiness further. Fortunately for them, demons hardly bat an eye to such darkness, and demons were exactly the visitors they were now expecting. Well again, demons and two… ah… you’ll see.

A small entranceway room was constructed in its center against the wall and stood as the only way of getting inside. It too, was locked for the moment. But unlike most of the station, its windows were not obstructed, allowing a peek into its unlit interior.</span>

Zereth dashed at the best of his ability to avoid one of the relentless blade-swings of the simulation droid. With a graceful spin he disarmed one of the drones, slicing its arm clean off with his Nikana. Zereth thrusted his hand forward, directing his fingers into a tight clenching motion. Void energy started pulsing around his hand, reflecting in his golden gaze. He&#39;d raise his hand, lifting the droid off of its legs and with a forceful swing with his arm the dismembered droid was encapsuled with void energy, flinging him with an immense force into another training droid. Another one of the agile droids doomed up from behind, twisting him around and punching him in the gut. The droid was about to swing its training sword before the simulation was paused, and the scenery started dematerializing into the trianing simulator room.

<strong>Cephalon Eldar:</strong> <em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your training session, starchild. But I have good news! You&#39;ve received a message in your inbox, I believe it is from the organization you applied for.&quot;</em>

Zereth grabbed his stomach, getting up from his knees, patting the droid on it&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Next time I&#39;ll get you Z-4.&quot; He&#39;d grunt a bit, trying to mask the pain his gut was experiencing right now. &quot;Eldar, read the message.&quot;</span>

Zereth&#39;s lips curled up to a smirk whilst he took off his training suit and replaced it for one of his nice, flowing white robes. His feet tapped over the heated orbiter flooring while he brought his finger to his lower lip. &quot;How interesting. I&#39;ve been looking for some run-ins with the unknown. Undiscovered means unclaimed. Eldar, set course for the provided coordinates and ready my landing craft. We&#39;ve got a deadline to catch. Oh- and fill a hot bath for me will you?&quot; He said, whilst wandering into his personal quarters. He took a moment to look at his own reflection in one of his many ayatan treasures before looking at one of his displayed warframes. It was his Harrow. &quot;I believe its time you get another run, good friend.&quot; He said valiantly looking at the golden-trimmed, completely black frame.

&quot;Consider it done, star child.&quot; Eldar replied to his requests. The sound of the Orbiter&#39;s engines started roaring, taking a few minutes to start up. Zereth made his way to his bathing chamber, disrobing and sinking into his bath, groaning at the feeling of his stomach.

He&#39;d tilt his head back as the feeling subsided, smirking at his lapis lazuli sealing, looking at the golden constellations displayed on it. “How thrilling. Here we come. Eldar, engage hyperjump.” At that instant the ship hyper-drive engines bursted forth an immense amount of energy, warping them to close proximity of their destination.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Kinsey</strong>

Kinsey sat on the floor of their cluttered orbiter, using a screwdriver to scrape greasy Kubrow hair out of the latch mechanism to their personal quarters. A scanner tuned to local Grineer frequencies played loudly from elsewhere in the ship as it made another lazy orbit around Mars. Once they deemed the door clear of any more clumps of hair, they stood and brushed themself off with grubby hands, tossing the screwdriver in the vague direction of their foundry.

The scanner&#39;s volume suddenly sank as Kinsey&#39;s cephalon spoke. &quot;Operator, you have a response to your application. I think it&#39;s a bad idea but you&#39;ve had worse so I&#39;m not stopping you.&quot; Kinsey sighed dramatically. &quot;Rahm, Vilkas! Just read the message!&quot;

The Tenno set about re-organizing one of their scrap piles while Vilkas recited the message. Tossing a ration pack into the proper pile, they straightened. &quot;Wait, did the message really have a smiley in it?&quot; &quot;Believe it or not, yes.&quot; &quot;Huh. Weirdos. Well, go to the coordinates, then. I&#39;d rather get there on time.&quot;

Vilkas gave an affirmative beep, and the engines sputtered to life as Kinsey wandered to their quarters to fetch their favorite warframe. No inch of wall space was unclaimed, countless portraits of grineer defectors displayed throughout the room. Oddly, the portraits of two Corpus crewmen occupied a section of their own, looking out of place among the countless identical, warped faces. An alcove in the center of the wall boasted the form of a battered white Frost with orange detailing, posed with an Ack and Brunt at the ready.

&quot;Alright, frosty boy, let&#39;s get going. Here&#39;s hoping I&#39;m not the only one to show up, eh?&quot; they chattered to their warframe as they selected an option on a yellow-tinted screen, causing the platform to lower the warframe to the ground. With a rush of void energy, the tenno transferred into the warframe, and Leveret stepped forward, rolling his shoulders.

The doors to his quarters closed behind him with a hiss - <em>nice, it&#39;s working now</em> -  and he made his way to the front of the orbiter. On his way forward, the entire ship lurched as it picked up speed in preparation to travel to the given coordinates. Leveret, quite used to the jolt, didn&#39;t even pause in his steps. He sat unceremoniously on a crate at the front of the ship, watching his favorite red planet fade quickly from view. Tucking one leg under himself in a half-assed approximation of a meditative position, Leveret settled in to watch the stars as he approached his destination.

The sunlight reflected off the silver plating on the Rhino as he trudged through the undergrowth of one of Earth&#39;s many forests. He always came here to relax. Somewhere out of the way of the chaos of the rest of the system. The Liset that had brought him here hovered just above the ground, safe from the wildlife on the ground. Boarding the ship, Kamos flew the ship back to orbit. And, of course, his inbox was full of new messages. Spam, spam, wrong person, ghouls again... Oh, hey. A message from RU. It&#39;s about time.

&quot;So, Atela, these RU guys accepted me. That means I&#39;ll probably be moving around a lot more. When you&#39;re able to respond to my messages, I&#39;ll probably be allowed to tell you where I am.&quot; Kamos stepped away from the recording device, letting the message send to his partner in crime. He hasn&#39;t heard from her for months. She was probably still busy with her mission. He wasn&#39;t entirely sure what she was doing, but it was probably important, right?

Kamos input the provided coordinates, and let the Orbiter pilot itself there. He went about wandering around the ship, as he often did lately. It felt a bit more empty without Atela, but that wasn&#39;t <em>too</em> bad. More space for his noggles, then. Noggles were great. The footsteps of the Rhino echoed throughout the ship rhythmically, as he checked for anything out of order. Nothing, as always. Everything was always in order.</span>

“Now Licky! What did I say about that?!”

I boomed out as the Charger Eximus sitting across from me freezes with his…uh…face? Covered with cake frosting. He lifts it’s fleshy head with a deep incoherent mumble and plops down on it’s rump.

“Better, now behave like Bombo here”

I motion with my cup to my right, where a Corrupted Lancer sat with his Dera still out and pointing towards a invisible enemy, ever so slightly twitching his aim to the left as if recalibrating where the enemy is. 

“Oh… you dropped your crown”

I groan and get up from my seat to walk behind the Lancer, picking up the paper tiara that slid off his head and putting it back in place. He doesn’t flinch, nor act, but still aims down the barrel of his Dera at the air and mumbles something incoherent under his breath.

“There! Better!”

I smile as I gaze over the Lancer’s shoulder to the round table that I had setup at the center of the 3 door corridor in my Orbiter. Sitting next to it is a rag tag assortment of specters, which are – starting from the Lancer and going right: a Ancient Healer that I named Stretchy and has a little purple nest of feathers on top of it’s head. A MOA that is smeared across the muzzle with orange lipstick reacts to Eyo. The Charger mentioned before that has a white tutu around it’s hip. A floating Shield Osprey with a bucket of sprinkles on top of it, that only reacts with a brt-brt and so is named that. A Clem that has a tea cup taped to his right Grakata. And finally my chair, where my ever so stoic Wukong stood behind. There is a yellow cake in the middle of the round table and everyone has a cup of juice…not that anyone is touching it…apart from Clem! The whole setup is being tied together by a somber tone in the background that can be only described as someone banging pots in a random pattern in the infested room.</span>

My words get interrupted as my Cephalon buzzes to life and out of nowhere a projection of Sargas Ruk pops down from the ceiling, but he doesn’t seem like the real deal as this Ruk is colored in two shades of yellow, one golden that highlights the face of the projected Ruk and the other shade is dull, used more as filler for the non-important spaces.

“Rraaahudd Stoirin! A message has arrived! GLORIOUS, is it not?!”

The yellow colored Sargas Ruk yells out in a fabulous fashion but not in the voice that you’d expect. This one speaks with the voice of Teshin…but a more excited and flamboyant Teshin.

<strong>Sonera</strong>
I slam my cup down on the metal table, almost shattering the porcelain in my hand. 

“Damn it Adus! I told you not to interrupt my meetings! I was just about to find out who ate the Frostleaf chocolate!”

<strong>Adus (Milaus)</strong>
The colored Ruk pauses, thinking. But then let’s out in his glamorous Teshin voice.
“OH! That’s today!? Ahhhhh! But wait wait! Important message!”

<strong>Sonera</strong>
One of my brows shoot up in surprise and I lean back in my chair

“Oh? Tell tell! Is it the bouncy people?!”

<strong>Adus (Milaus)</strong>
The Ruk shakes his head

“Better! It’s a callback for that corporation you applied to. Pupil, it is a call for a interview!”

Ruk then pulls out the coordinates and time on screen with a flicker on his left palm, motioning with his other towards it like in some kind of shampoo commercial.

<strong>Sonera</strong>
I let out a groan, flinging the cup in the air above me, but instead of a expected crash to ring out my Wukong snatches it just as it started to fall and returns to his firm soldier pose with both hands behind his back…now one of them including the cup. 

“HEK! Today!? B-b-but! I’m half way to Neptune to get that autograph!”</span>

<strong>Sonera</strong>
“NO”

I jump up from my seat, almost flipping the whole table.

“I need the credits. Set the course, maximum burn!”

<strong>Adus (Milaus)</strong>
“At once flesh one!”
The projection whips up and the ship makes a mild turn to correct it’s course.

<strong>Sonera</strong>
I look down at my self and at my current clothes situation….which consists of heavy boots and a dull over worn linen shirt that is 4 times my size that is now more like a comfortable tunic. I hum under my breath and quickly go change in to my battle ones, which is the basic standard transference suit with Varida sleeves, Ceno leggings of course, can’t forget the Grineer mask!

I walk back towards the tea party and pause.

“Talk it over! When I come back I want a name eh?!”

I huff towards them and just as always I get no real response from them, just the mumbling and buzzing. I smile and walk past them towards the Navigator, my Wukong following close behind</span>

 A beat up and scratched up sapphire colored Xiphos with emerald accents glides towards the lonely outpost. It doesn’t even slow down as it enters zooms towards the drop site with it’s lower door opened where a sky colored Wukong dangles. In the ultimate drive by effort, the Wukong is ejected just over the drop zone and the Xiphos just continues onwards in a wide arc, returning from where it came from.

<strong>Sonera</strong>
With athletic flips and twists I roughly land on the surface of the outpost in crouch position. <em>”He he! Bet it looked cool eh!?”</em> I smirk and get up, only to be greeted by the sound of cracking knees and knuckles <em>”Ayayai! He remember that”</em>

I wince at the sound and feel of the aftermath of the superhero landing, lifting my head to look around to see that I am alone at the moment and no welcoming party nor any other living soul to greet me.

“Wha! Nobody is here?!”

I groan and glance towards the facility. Pretty dark and ominous. I tilt my head as I hop towards it expecting the doors to slid open but nope, that doesn’t happen. I hum under my breath and look towards one of the windows. Hoisting myself towards them I slam my Wukong’s head in to it to see inside but that too is met with a dead end as it’s pitch black.

“Ahhhh OH WELL!”

I push myself off the window and transfer out of my warframe, walking to the front in skips with him trailing close behind.</span>

The craft&#39;s engines began to taper off as it neared the obvious, if rather off-putting landing platform, which at present sat empty, save for a single, emerald-colored craft. As the craft finished docking, the craft&#39;s door opened with a hiss.

Aurelia:
She had come a long way for this... &quot;Interview.&quot; She happened upon the signal by chance, but the voice that came with the message had grabbed her attention with the intensity of a black hole. &#39;It couldn&#39;t be him&#39;, she had thought at the time. They were dead. Everyone was dead. But the voice was too enticing for her to ignore. She scanned the immediate area cautiously, unconvinced that she wasn&#39;t walking into a trap. Finding no apparent threats, she sent her little puppet forward, its metallic feet clicking onto the landing pad. It was a small drone of Corpus design: a MOA, albeit one that was altered for reconnaissance rather than combat. It&#39;s blue paint job seemed to glow in the stark light as it purposefully strode towards the waiting door. If she was right, then she would have excellent news to report to her Operator. If she was wrong... Well, one MOA would be an acceptable loss.</span>

That situation, however was about to change, with the incoming transmission that was arriving for the Tenno on board.

Inari:
Relaxing in her personal quarters, Inari could be seen sprawled out on the long couch that wrapped around her aquarium, a sketchbook with some rough drawings of the Ostrom market laid on on the table with a few bits of charcoal. The music from the Somachord filled the stillness of the room, as the tenno looked up at the painted ceiling.

Cephalon Puck:
Little clown, incoming message... it seems that request form you filled out a few cycles ago came back and you have been verified and confirmed for the job, would you like me to send you the details to your quarters?

Inari:

Getting up off her back Inari nodded, &quot;Yeah Puck bring it up on the holoscreen in here&quot;. The message popped up in front of her, the words bringing a small smile to her face, &quot;puck set our ship to the coordinates that are in the message, looks like we get to have some fun today&quot; hopping up off her couch she picked up her leather sketchbook, flipping it shut before replacing it back onto the table, walking by the display case she looked up to her wine coloured mirage prime with a small smile, &quot;well vacation times up looks like we are back at it&quot;

Cephalon Puck: &quot;with joy little clown,&quot; the ships cephalon was happy to see it&#39;s operator smiling again after so much down time, pinpointing the coordinates to a very remote location it set cycled up the drive system to get them underway into whatever new shenanigans awaited them.</span>

Nothing disturbed the deafening silence, save the constant, low hum of the facility itself. The tall lamps resembling streetlights failed to touch the further half of the pad with their luminescence, settling to let it drown in a faint dim.

Sonera could barely make out shapes inside the entrance room. Some long desk stretched the length of the room perhaps? Along with what looked like... a chair... of some sort. A chair, with something humanoid resting on it.~</span>

The smaller of the duo is seated on top of the rock and by the look of them they can’t be more than 1.50m tall, just a puny little existence. The taller figure is a Wukong that is standing beside them, both seeming occupied with one another.

“One, two, three, SHOOT”

At my last call both me and my Wukong throw out either rock, paper or scissor with our hands. In this specific game, I throw scissors while he threw rock causing me to let out a groan

“Again?! You’re cheating!”

I see a smug smile tugging at the corner of his lips and I reach out to playfully smack him across it, susessfully stopping it from spreading. But then, I hear something approaching and I lift my head up to spot the approaching MOA.

“Finally!”

I hop off the rock and quickly hop towards it in twirling strides, stopping right in front of it.

“Hey hey, are you the interviewer?”

I reach out to flick at it’s muzzle, crouching down to inspect it. <em>”No no, looks standard made…Corpus? I’m sure they weren’t no?”</em></span>

From it emerged a similarly battered white Frost with orange grineer-style lines painted on and a damaged Aurora helmet. He was equipped with an ack/brunt - sheathed for now - and no other visible weapons.

Were she capable, Aurelia would have visibly recoiled at the strange Tenno and their seemingly autonomous Wukong frame coming towards her. She was only here for the job interview, not to attract any unnecessary attention. She had assumed a MOA would be inconspicuous enough to avoid situations like this, but it seemed she was wrong. The Tenno appeared to be oddly energetic, given the surroundings, but Aurelia decided to disregard this observation for now. Making use of the minor modifications she had managed to install in the MOA for the sake of communication.

&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not.&quot; She said, trying to maintain a professional demeanor. &quot; I am here for the interview, as you are.&quot; She paused for a moment, hoping that this statement would be enough to satisfy the inquisitive Tenno.  &quot;Please, don&#39;t touch the MOA. I can answer most questions you may have about it, if you are that curious.&quot; This. This right here was why she let Him handle social situations like this. small talk with strangers gave her chills.  Luckily for her, one more Tenno arrived on the landing platform as this conversation was occurring, this one armed to the teeth. She hoped that they would be a decent distraction for this more friendly Tenno. The less questions she was asked by these unknown Tenno, the better.</span>

My head jerks upwards as the MOA spoke, not expecting it at all, causing me to tear my gaze from it’s feet to look back up at it’s muzzle. A low hum rumbles down my throat as I straighten up from my previous crouch, dusting off my leggings from the invisible dust that had settled there. Now, fully upright, I cross my arms over my chest and purse my lips, eying the mechanical creature with my narrowed dark emerald eyes

“I see…”

I mutter under my breath, uncoiling my left arm to scratch behind my ear while still gazing at the MOA in a curious manner. <em>”A MOA for a interview? No wait…is it connected to someone? Must be! Or! One of those spiffy Venus ones eh!? Yes yes! Sure there are ones that talk there. Rights to mechas!</em>” I tilt my head to the left, pondering <em>”Or…is someones proxy? No no, why send a scout…all friendlies here no?”</em>

I huff through my nose and look over my shoulder to my Wukong that is leaning against the rocks. My gaze drops down to his hip and at his current no-weapon situation causing me to frown <em>”Blast! Always forget to bring weapons!”</em>

I clear my throat, rather loudly, and whip my head back towards the MOA, a friendly smile in place behind the Grineer mask. I part my lips, to ask one of the many questions circling around, but the sudden appearance of another Tenno landing craft grabbed my attention and I crane my head towards it, watching as a battered and cracked Frost appears. <em>”Uuuuuuu! Meridian I see! Yes yes!”</em>

And then, the Rhino made a appearance causing me to let out this high pitched squeal. Excited, I throw my left arm in the air above my head and start wildly waving it at them, coaxing them to come and join me in the wait…assuming they are friendly, if not…well…I have him!

“Hey hey!”

I yell out at the top of my lungs, my voice coming out a bit hoarser than expected for someone of my size.</span>

The Rhino immediately pointed his sobek at the source of the noise, finger hovering over the trigger. Who was this, and why were they yelling? He remaimed stationary, shotgun pointed at Sonera, completely and utterly silent for a moment. Should he say something? Try and communicate? Punch them?

&quot;Who are you, and why the Vay Hek are you yelling at me?&quot; Kamos demanded, not lowering his weapon.</span>

Luckily, the battered white Frost was, indeed, friendly. Leveret gleefully returned the wave and started forward to speak to the masked Tenno.

He barely made it three steps before another Tenno with a familiar voice spoke near him. Leveret stopped in his tracks, turning to face the source of the voice.

“Holy shit! Kamos?” He cried, throwing his arms out to the side, both in a gesture of surprise and happiness, as well as the preparation for a bear hug, should his old friend be so willing.</span>

she looked out her forward viewing screen looking at the almost bland space station, looking near the landing pad she noticed quite a few different Tenno craft in the docking area. As her forest green Liset came into it&#39;s own landing vector, she spotted on the main pad a Frost, a MOA, and a Rhino. The Frost and the Rhino seemed to be talking like old friends while the MOA bot seemed quite happy to keep all to itself.

&quot;hmmm seems like the party members are just starting to show up, Puck keep the Avalon on standby after we pull in, but if things get dicey be sure to have it ready to fire up and get back to the Orbiter quick time&quot;, she turned from the front view screen as the Liset made it&#39;s final landing maneuvers towards the pad. She walked to her Mirage prime laying a gloved hand onto it&#39;s sword steel carpace, &quot;well Ami time to go play&quot;. Walking past the arsenal station Inari closed her eyes for a second taking in a deep breath to calm herself. Walking back to her transference chair, Inari tired her hair back into her usual ponytail before taking a seat. The chair doors sealed her in leaving her in a comfortable darkness, closing her eyes, Inari felt her mind link up to the mirage giving her sight once more at the front end of her lander. Looking down she flexed the muscle fibers in her arms giving everything a quick test before taking her Cernos Prime, and lex holstering them on her back and thigh respectively. Looking down at the back of her hand she flexed her Kogages making sure the gauntlets shifted over the frames knuckles and back with ease. Satisfied with all her pre-mission checks Inari stepped off the platform and headed toward the exit hopping out the Avalon and gently landing onto the deck, looking up through her neuroptic lenses, the trickster offered a simply bow with a calm &quot;Good day everyone&quot;</span>

Kamos turned around, pointing the shotgun at Leveret for a split second, before recognizing him and lowering the weapon. He was stunned for a moment. That stuff on Ceres had been a while ago, hadn&#39;t it?

&quot;Hey, Lev! What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; That was a stupid question, something he realized pretty much the moment he asked. Probably this whole RU thing. Why else would there be this many people here already? Kamos didn&#39;t go for the hug, though. He doesn&#39;t like hugs. &quot;How&#39;re you doing?&quot;</span>

This landing pad had certainly gotten more lively, with three more Tenno now arriving on the platform. While Aurelia was grateful to have the rather exuberant Tenno from earlier distracted with the new arrivals, she didn&#39;t feel any more at ease with the current crowd present. If this was indeed a trap of some sort, whoever was responsible for setting it up must have been quite confident if they thought they could take on this many Tenno at once, even if some of them did not appear to be fully armed. By her reasoning, this presented three likely scenarios: first, this interview was indeed genuine, which would be a welcome turn of events, she admitted to herself. Second,  this was indeed a setup, but their host was overconfident in their abilities to hold multiple Tenno, much less kill them. Thinking from her own memory, even a small group of uncoordinated Tenno was capable of decimating thousands of soldiers and mechanical proxies with seemingly little difficulty. Finally, there was the third option: This was a trap, and their host was someone who was actually capable of subduing that many Tenno. The last possibility made Aurelia shudder apprehensively. There was a short list of people throughout the system that she was aware of that could be capable of that. None of them were people Aurelia would enjoy interacting with.  All the same, two of the Tenno being apparently good friends was a good sign to her, as that would likely reduce the overall tension of the meeting. Speaking of which...

Aurelia offered the closest thing the MOA could manage to a bow, dipping its muzzle downward  towards the rather polite Mirage frame for a moment before turning back to the entrance to the larger station and directing the MOA to move in that direction. Standing out here would provide no answers as to what awaited inside.</span>

As soon as the Rhino pointed his Sobek towards me I insintcivyl threw my hands in the air to indicate that I am no threat. Luckaly the other one grabbed his attention and there was no need to transfer to my frame.

Tilting my head in a curious manner, I lower my hands to clasp behind my back and with a smile I glance towards the MOA as it dipped it’s muzzle <em>”CUUUUUUTE</em>” I inwardly scream…which somehow finds it’s way out as I let out a stiffened squeal.

I was just about to lean towards it and say something when the unexpected CLANG rang through the air making me visibly jump up – like a frightened cat – and quickly transfer to my Wukong with a flash of dull green.

Now in my Wukong, I hop and twirl towards the noise, fists raised in the air ready to smack the buffoon that caused the noise.

“Huh?”

I mumble as I spot the toppled lamp post with something glowing against the wall. 

“Hmmm maybe we go inside? Maybe opened eh?”

I shrug my shoulders and make my way towards the light to make sure it’s not something that’s gonna catch fire and burn this place or explode the rock. With added in skips and jumps I hop towards it, making my walking trajectory wobbling to the sides.</span>

She watched from a distance as the others drew nearer to the glowing platform, having the MOA take a couple steps backward as the light practically dazzled its sensors. This may have been due to a malfunction caused by the rough landing of the latest arrival. A quick scan of the control console that emerged when one of the Warframes, the autonomous Wukong, which was now possessed by its master, stood near it did not reveal anything out of the ordinary. By all accounts it appeared to be a normal maintenance console. &#39;Well, whatever passes for normal on this station.&#39; she remarked snidely to herself. Aurelia ordered the MOA to slowly step backward towards the waiting door, wanting to head inside while keeping an eye on the rest of the group. Whatever was going on, she wanted to get this interview underway as soon as possible.</span>

I hop in front of the console and lean over it, humming in thought while rubbing my chin with my left hand, stroking a long invisible beard there <em>”Broken? Dark? Why lit up now?”</em> I shrug my shoulders and wave my hand at the approaching mass.

“Distraction!”

I exclaim with a flail of my arms and swiftly hop around the console, ignoring it completely. With smooth, modern dance like, strides I make my way towards the door. Lifting a arm I knock on it, strong and violently to make sure that whatever was inside heard it.

“OY! It’s one minute pass the meeting! Either open up or I’m starting a survival over here!”

I stand back and cross my hand over my chest, my hip poking to one side in a more impatient stance, my left foot thumping on the floor.</span>

Its movement echoed throughout the still space. A thick darkness shadowed the room, as if the very air itself had congealed into tar. Then three lights in the ceiling flickered on, illuminating a reception desk spanning across the opposite wall from the building.

And someone sitting in a high-rise chair behind it.~

Dr. Breezy was enjoying this.

She sat in the reception’s comfortable office chair in a primly manner. Back straight, shoulders relaxed, posture perfect. Special orders, they said. Many may have found her assignment dull, boring, or even may have wondered if it was some sort of executive punishment; but to a Level D researcher, it was a slice of heaven.

Breezy was dressed in a typical navy blue RU human relations shirt and slacks. Being without a labcoat after so long invoked a strange sensation of nudity, as if wearing one was tantamount to slipping on shoes. The doctor was tapping away on a datapad when the doors opened and the lights turned on. Breezy failed to suppress a smile spreading itself across her cheeks, but then again, she didn’t try very hard.

She combed a hand through her flowing mane of curly hair, keeping her eyes glued to the tablet.</span>

I jump, yet again in surprise, as the doors sudently opened. <em>”Whoa! Must have good mechanics!</em>”

I pause, looking to the left and right – glancing at the others as if to ask if they saw that too. With a shrug of my shoulders I peek inside, tilting my head towards the reception desk and the occupant sitting on it <em>”Uuuuuuuu! I like the uniform!</em>”

I quickly hop towards the woman with a gleeful smile spreading across my Wukong’s expressive face, his silver fangs flashing in the light. Within a couple of skips, I find myself in front of the table, my tail starting to swish from side to side in a playful manner, ever so slightly coiling around the right leg before letting to and continuing it’s circular motion.

“Hey hey! Interview person? Yes? We have arrived for the ehhhh evaluation!”

I happily speak up, pointing towards my comrades that have probably started pooling inside the room by now.</span>

Noticing motion at the corner of his vision, Leveret turned to follow and soon his gaze fell upon a familiar grey and green Vauban. He was too excited to even notice the frost next to him, which he would have recognized as well. 

&quot;Hey, Chegar!&quot; he called, jogging up alongside him, catching the Vauban in a walking side-hug. &quot;Good to see you!&quot;

Leveret was surprised he was running into so many familiar faces, but excited as well. He found he much preferred working with Tenno he already knew.</span>

The MOA quickly whipped itself around towards the doors as they slid open, revealing the mysterious figure seated just inside. Now this was more of what Aurelia had in mind when she thought of the interview : a proper liaison, dressed in a well-designed uniform, if she did say so herself, and what seemed like a more formal interview environment, to boot. All that being said, she would have been lying if she said she appreciated the self-contented smirk that this mystery woman currently had plastered on her face. For once, Aurelia was quite thankful she did not have a face of her own to broadcast her disdain.  Brushing her own misgivings aside, Aurelia marched the MOA into the now-opened conference room, taking a position closer to the leftmost doorway that would allow her to monitor the maximum amount of space possible. While her choice of seating prevented her from observing the Tenno that lingered outside, she could hear yet more happy sounding reunions taking place between some of the Tenno. Their happy words and gestures towards each other acted as a solid reminder of why she was here. 

&#39;I just hope this isn&#39;t just a waste of time.&#39; she inaudibly grumbled to herself, refocusing the MOA&#39;s visual sensors on the interviewer before beginning to stew in her own thoughts.</span>

The sound of the opening door moved her attnetion away from the lamp post and the frost messing with the data console toward the small reception room. the cool nature of the woman in the blue uniform sitting behind the desk didn&#39;t bring any ease about the whole situation, her fingers eased off the lex grip, but her hand strayed around the area as she sauntered in to the room. Watching some of the other Tenno greet each other as old friends, Inari assumed that some of them had worked together on previous missions. This was probably one of the few times that she could remember in her long record of contracts that she&#39;s taken where she worked with other Tenno. &quot;well let&#39;s see what this whole interview is about&quot;...</span>

Well, there goes his theory that this is some sort of test of survival or something. As the door opened, Kamos reached for his Gram, prepared to eviscerate whatever came through that door. Clearly, that wouldn&#39;t be required. He kept his hand near the hilt of the greatsword, but relaxed a little bit. Looks like this would be a normal interview, after all. Kamos observed the two Tenno that had just showed up. Leveret probably knew them. Eh, whatever. He turned his attention back to the one likely doing the interview or something.</span>

Each one seemed to have distinct traits and colours, a stark contrast to the uniformity of the environments she usually worked in. It was like watching a circus.

A circus of doom.

“Yes, just a second,” she replied to the Wukong-brand warframe addressing her.

With an overly emphasized swipe, Breezy opened the recruitment roster on her datapad. Eight names jumped onto the screen with a brief description of each entry and a small portrait. Nine names, with only seven people on station. The doctor bit her lip.

“Okay, thank you all for coming! I’m going to do a roll call here so answer when I call your name please,” Breezy announced in a raised voice. “Leveret, Radiar, Svytoj, Chegar, Cephalon Aurelia, Sonera, Zereth, Inari, and Kamos.”</span>

Reaching the bottom of the list, Breezy pursed her lips. As she had suspected, there were two people missing. The only thing left to do was to pick the brains of those around.

“Does anyone know a Radiar or Zereth? They were supposed to be here too,” Breezy inquired of everyone in the room.</span>

Hearing the name of the brash Tenno she had met on Cetus, a twinge of happiness creeped on the corners of her lips almost to an internal smile, the guy had quite the ego during the small scuffle even using his powers on her to lose her transference with her Mirage Prime. So the fact he hadn&#39;t shown up yet was a bit of a lucky break for her. She casually swayed her head back and forth in her Mirage giving a simple reply to the doctors request, &quot;sorry couldn&#39;t tell you&quot;.</span>

“Never heard of either of them. Guess they decided not to show.” Leveret added, shrugging slightly. He was surprised how many Tenno had shown up. One name he’d heard had rung a bell though...he glanced around and spotted Svytoj, catching the other Frost’s eye and waving.</span>

My head tilts to the side as the non-Tenno personnel asked a question. In fluid and quick movements, I plop my rear on  the desk at which the researcher sat at and put on a thinking pose, tapping my chin with my index finger

“Nope nope, yes yes! Have NOT heard of them. Maybe ran in to a Grineer battalion?”

I scratch the top of my head with the hand that I used to tap my chin. I throw a glance at  the MOA yet again and furrow my brows.</span>

“Hmmmmm,” Dr. Breezy contemplated, tapping a stylus on the table next to the playful Sonera. Now the decision technically came down to her: should they continue, or not? If something went wrong it could be her head on the chopping block this time. On the other hand, if she cancelled it due to minor factors, would she really be let off that easy?

“Very well,” Breezy declared in a clear voice, “with everybody inside we can begin.”

All at once, the doors slammed shut. Their status indicators switched to red once again as they locked, forming a barrier between them and the eerie atmosphere outside. A couple seconds of silence passed. 

Then, the big entrance door sounded an amalgamation of noises as the complex mechanism inside began to disengage.</span>

The hall stretched to both side before disappearing into an elbow bend further into the facility. A mechanical pedestal rested on the ground in front of the elevator. An odd placement, especially since it resembled a holo-communicator.

Doctor Breezy was almost done here.

My head jerks towards the doors as they slammed shut as soon as everyone entered. A playful smile spreading across my Wukong’s flexible face as my head starts bobbing from side to side in tune to a silent music that started to play inside my head. I swiftly hop off the table and do a quirk bow to the researcher…why? I DUNNO! Seems appropriate no? <em>”Ahhh social cues! Nailed it! Yes yes!</em>”

Still smiling like a kid in a candy shop, I hop my way towards the opening gates, each stride as light as a feather but as loose as a flower in the wind. If one didn’t have the visual of my semi-dancing Wukong then it’s as if I’m just a breeze passing by.

I twirl past the researcher and hop on the elevator, my eyes lifting up to gaze at the researcher

“Tell tell, what is this process you speak of? Tests? Evaluations? Missions?!” My Wukong’s dark green energy lights up at the last bit, my tail coiling around my left leg tightly in a effort to calm the excitement that is bubbling up inside</span>

Satisfied that he&#39;d greeted everyone he recognized, Leveret joined the overexcited Wukong on the elevator. He crossed his arms, idly prodding at an old dent in his armor as he waited for the elevator to fill up. This was quite the crowd, to say the least. Leveret found he felt out of his element, surrounded by so many Tenno and no operatives.

&quot;Hey, Any idea who those two missing tenno were?&quot; Svytoj asked.

&quot;No Clue. Though I am worried that my name wasn&#39;t called... Did my file go missing?&quot; Chegar said, now looking around seeming somewhat antsy now.

&quot;No worries, Kiddo. I&#39;m sure these guys know what they&#39;re doing.&quot;~</div></span>

Jarred slightly by the closing doors, Aurelia directed what meager resources the MOA could provide to observe the surroundings as well as the speaker. &#39;Ugh, why didn&#39;t I install more sensors in this pile of scrap?&#39; she pondered irritably. controlling it was already an unwieldy mess, and its lack of advanced sensory capabilities did NOT help. For once, she was in agreement with the excitable Tenno. She too was very curious as to what this &#39;process&#39; entailed. However, it seemed the only way to find out was to venture further inside the complex. Sighing inwardly in resignation, she directed the MOA to quickly march into the waiting elevator, maneuvering it into a corner of the elevator and having it squat down on its mechanical haunches, so as to take up as little space as possible among the admittedly intimidating Tenno.</span>

Then Breezy let out a nervous sigh. This was indeed a corner of paradise, but it came with a cost. The Tenno had seen her face. If they held a grudge, her throat would be slit first. The Execs knew it.

The doctor quickly snatched her datapad off the counter and made her way to the door, anxious to leave. She made her way over to a small lightweight transport craft that lay strapped to the underside of the landing platform, pulling on the somewhat tight reception uniform. Breezy was done playing dress up.


~The elevator buttons weren’t lit. Additionally, the current number being displayed on the cracked floor level display was a glitching 23. 

As the Tenno passed the hall, it was easy to notice that the connecting corridors on either end didn&#39;t have any lights on. Only the one near the entrance was. Fortunately, that wouldn’t matter for long. A couple silent moments ticked by after the entrance door had closed and changed to red.

And then the lights went out.</span>

My gaze stayed on the researcher all the way till she went out of it. <em>”RUDE! Not answering a question!</em>” I huffed under my breath and turned to look at the other pooling warframes and errr the Moa. <em>”A Frost, a Rhino, A Vauban, a Mirage…uhhhhhh….fun times ahead! Yes yes!</em>”

Then the lights went out causing me to let out a loud gasp out of shock “It’s a party!?” I yell out but quickly dim it down as I look around through the darkness. I turn to the Frost and chuckle, saying to him in my cheerful and light voice 

“Yes or no it’s not matter! Have fun eh?”

I smile, my Wukong’s fangs flashing in the darkness as it reflects my emerald energy. I then turn to look towards the Mirage and point at her…if she can see the motion in this nothingness 

“Say say, use your errrrr show dance eh? The ball!”

I do the motion any Mirage does before throwing the disco ball and at the end of it I pretend I’m throwing one towards the darkened room, saying to her through my motion that she should fling it there if she’s going to do it. Hey! It gives light!

“Eh?”</span>

she nodded to Levert as the lights in the room shut off all around them, releasing her grip from the frosts hand, she turned around as her neuroptics lit up in front of her like the other frames, trying to get a understanding of their situation. &quot;great what are we gonna do here go walking in the dark?&quot; 

The words of the spriteful Wukong gain her attention as she watches him do the hand motions for forming the prism orb that she knew her frame could do to produce some more light  than their current optic enhancers.

&quot;Yeah let&#39;s get a more accurate idea of what&#39;s going on&quot;, she brought her hands up forming a circle close to her chest as she focused her void energy into the condensed prism sphere.  Small spindles of light traced from  the warframe&#39;s fingertips, quickly spiraling into an orb as her hands deftly rotated, controlling the sphere&#39;s movement. Bringing her hands down to her waist, Inari shot the prism forward letting it&#39;s void light brighten the darkened hallway, the rays of light amplifying the brightness by their refraction off the metal bulkheads and panels as well as the refractions off the frames sword-steel bodies. 

As the energy drained from her, she  noticed the mechanical pedestal in the middle, but beyond that there wasn&#39;t anything else of note, her right hand raised in the air slowly rotating her wrist as she balled her fingers lightly into a fist and gave a firm squeeze, shattering the prism and letting the darkness regain it&#39;s hold on the corridor. &quot;well next to that pedestal over there I&#39;m not seeing much else, anyone else catch anything?&quot; she asked to the other members of their rag-tag party.</span>

First the ominous wait outside, and now this spooky scene? Aurelia was getting quite tired of the run-around these people seemed intent on giving her. She waited while the Mirage in their group conjured a blindly sphere of light and sent it drifting across the darkened room.  Noting the location, she decided to speak up, as the MOA she had brought could finally be of some use.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I couldn&#39;t catch much of anything with that light. Where did you say that pedestal was? I may have something here that can help.&quot; With a silent command, a set of bright headlights near the very front of the MOA blazed to life, their light cutting a swath through the darkness. Aurelia moved the MOA towards the front of the group, training its lights forward in an attempt to illuminate the path directly in front of them.</span>

I quickly make do of what little lighting the Mirage provided and whipped my head around the room to get a good read. <em>&quot;Right red, left green...two! TWO!</em>&quot; I smile as the room went dark once more. At the question of the Rhino I tilt my head humming

&quot;No no...oh wait! Ahhhh....nope...no no! It lingered but went away!&quot;

I shrug my shoulders and start walking forwards, tapping the Moa lightly on the top of it&#39;s mechanical head as I pass it, motioning with a coaxing finger to follow me.

&quot;Come come&quot;

I add with a smile as further incintive. EY! I may be unkillable but seeing in the dark is another thing.

I start walking towards the closest green door, hoping the Moa was trailing close behind to illuminate my path. Stopping right next to it I gesture for the mechanical creature to step close enough to trigger the sensors and open it...and possibly give us a glimpse of what&#39;s inside door NUMBER 1!

&quot;No care no care, if anything jumps out I&#39;ll catch it!&quot;

I punch my palm to ephatise the end of that sentence.</span>

hearing the translation, Aurelia briefly ran through the files she had at her disposal. Unfortunately, technological developers were not her specialty, much less Grineer organizations. &quot; I am sorry, that name is not familiar to me either. However,  I&#39;d imagine the prescence of that slogan would suggest that there&#39;s some lethal security measures in this station. We should be careful.&quot; The last sentence took on a slightly harsher tone, as the MOA turned to direct the line to the rash Wukong. With a brief sigh of resignation, Aurelia moved the MOA to keep close to the excitable Wukong as it headed towards the nearest accessible door. Noting the signals she was being given, Aurelia offered another possibility. 

&quot;By all means Tenno, you should go first. If there is anything there, you stand a much better chance of surviving than this MOA does. At any rate, I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;</span>

I tilt my head towards the Moa, mulling it’s words over <em>”Ahhh…yes yes…more sense for the meat shield to go first no?”</em> I nod my head to myself and lift my right palm to smack the heel of it against my forehead, activating my Defy with a sheen of metallic green energy.

I look towards the mechanical creature and nod to it. Coiling my hands in to fists I quickly jump in front of the door and as soon as the sensors triggered I enter inside it with a combat roll that ends with a action crouch. I don&#39;t head too deep, just lingering at the doorway.

I quickly gaze around, hoping to catch what the heck is going on inside with the help of the Moa’s light from behind.</span>

She paced down the hallway toward the pedestal seeing if any of the rooms on the far left end could get accessed, her lex held low and in front of her as her Mirage&#39;s high heels clacked against the metal flooring.</span>

The Frost watched as Inari&#39;s Mirage moved toward the left hall. he looked back at Chegar and Leveret, and began to walk towards the hall, and eventually the unlocked door. He paused outside the door, looking further down the hallway before opening the door. He made certain to stay to one side of the opening.

“Oh…”

I huffed as I quickly scanned the inside of the room. It looks like it’s a stash station or one of those changing rooms. My posture relaxes and I stand up from my crouch.

With confident strides I pass the crates and the lockers, giving them nothing more than a glance as I notice the other green lit door. <em>”Yes yes…crates are fun but exploration is more so!”</em>

I turn to look over my shoulder towards the Moa, waving my hand at the crates

“Go go, if you want, check them out…maybe key cards inside or something we can use”

I waste no time and hop in front of the second door, poking my head inside to see the situation of this one.</span>

I do not have much information on this complex at the moment, but it is very unlikely that this place is capable of posing a serious threat to this many heavily armed Tenno.&quot; She was speaking fast, feverishly hoping that she would be able to talk this Tenno down before he did something rash. This was the only lead she had right now, and she refused to leave empty-handed. &quot;I suggest we investigate further, before we do anything our host could interpret as hostile.&quot; She knew her words would only be able to do so much here. More than anything else, what she needed now was information. With that in mind, she commanded the MOA to do a quick sweep of both the hallway and the side room that they had already been in, looking for a console of some kind that she could use.</span>

People talked, rationalized, some were losing it but me? Heh! Exploration calls! As I gaze down the hallway I take note of the other green lit openings and let out a excited squeal <em>”More more!</em>” Like a moth drawn to light, I quickly hop out of the previous room, forgetting all about the barrels and lockers and their possible content.

I go right and hop past it all, paying no mind to their conversations or suggestions. I poke my head through this new door, eyes dancing around to spot anything of importance inside it.

Let them figure it out with the console and stupid things!</span>

Noting the corpus terminal sitting idle nearby, Aurelia maneuvered the MOA towards it, though not expecting much in the way of intel. Before she could truly get engrossed in breaking into the console however, another result from the scan snatched her attention away. A wireless signal, coming from that hideously out of place Grineer pedestal. Aurelia ventured closer, trying to find the exact source, only to find a small antenna sticking out from the side, looking almost like an afterthought in the design of the pedestal. &#39;As usual,&#39; she mumbled snidely to herself, &#39;Grineer have no sense of aesthetics.&#39; Raising her voice, she attempted to get the group&#39;s attention. 

&quot;Everyone, I may have found something we can use.&quot; As she spoke, she attempted to intercept the signal emanating from the antenna, putting every resource she could spare into cracking whatever encryption shrouding the signal.</span>

More importantly, though, it looked like the energy had dissipated. Congratulations, they saved a door from Kamos&#39; wrath. He didn&#39;t look any more relaxed, though, still very clearly a bit on-edge. He stepped away from the door, turning around to glance around the room.
&quot;This still seems... off. They got a bunch of Tenno here, and then locked all of the doors. What do they want?&quot; Kamos was struggling to think of a possible answer. He tended to struggle with thinking in general, though, so it wasn&#39;t gonna be easy.~</span>

If Aurelia had a face, it would have shown a mixture of surprise and disappointment at present. She had expected such a secretive outpost to have a bit more security, and yet here it was, an entirely unprotected network access point, complete with a linked router and a MAC address. All the same, she was cautious. This had to be a trap. How could it not be? Unfortunately, it was her only possible source of information, and she didn&#39;t want to give that Rhino or  that Frost any reason to start breaking things, so it was a risk she would have to take. She wasn&#39;t sure what the MAC address was tied to exactly, but a quick search through some of the knowledge she had collected through favors to Suda, she managed to match the device&#39;s address to the brand name that was scrawled on the wall: Rekta  Robotics. Mere seconds later and she found the exact match, the pedestal that sat in the center of the room. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what it was for, as all this technobabble was hardly her forte, but mercifully there was an exploit for the device listed within her databases that would allow her at least some control of it.Though her previous words to the group seemed to have fallen on deaf ears, she decided to warn the others before she started her tinkering.

&quot;Everyone, I&#39;ve gotten into their network and I have taken control of the pedestal. I will attempt to activate it now, so please stand back. I am not quite sure what it does.&quot;</span>

The Frost nodded, moving away from the pedestal slightly and motioning for Kamos to do so as well, just in case.

&quot;Stand back, folks!&quot; he called to the rest of the group, only slightly louder than Aurelia had been. &quot;It&#39;s hacking time, I gues- Hey, where&#39;d that Wukong go?&quot;

Leveret looked around for the cheerful monkey frame, but they were nowhere to be found. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me folks are splitting up already?&quot;</span>

There were about sixteen extra machines total, with mechanical parts littering the floor around them.

“Uhhhhh”

I blinked…once, twice, thrice.

The brows on my Wukong wrinkle in confusion as I pull my head away from the room to look down the hall, from where I know I left the rest of the party

“Hey guys! Come come! I think I found a packaging line! Or errrrr….there is this…big uh…pointy thing that looks real…uh…POINTY”

I yell out towards them but don’t wait <em>”No no! Can’t wait! Not with these toys!</em>”

I hop towards the conveyor belt, heading down the working arms and giving them random pokes to make sure that they are in fact, not working. All the while I scan the dark encrusted room for anything that might be moving still as I make my way towards the enormous contraption sitting near it’s end.</span>

Aurelia monitored the window as the exploit was executed, finding the strange, skull-like insignia slightly juvenile, if nothing else. She made a mental note to try and find who created the exploit later, if there was time.  As the exploit continued, the screen blackened, making her worry that the exploit had failed. Finally seeing a chance to interact with the program, she was given a choice: as the system had just experience what it called a &quot;critical access failure&quot;, she could either restart the system, or leave it as it was. Under the circumstances, leaving it alone was hardly a helpful option. She entered the command to restart the system, the window closing as she did so, all the while thinking to herself, &quot;Well, let&#39;s see what this does.&quot;</span>

“Hello there!” he announced with an over-emphasized wave, “and welcome to RU Corp’s fresh-off-the-line warframe aptitude test station.”

The Limbo clasped his arms behind his back and looked around. “Now, you’re going to all want to gather around so I can explain some things for you.”

~Sonera’s prodding managed to accidentally turn on one of the machines, which whirred and clicked in response. The mechanism extended a couple of arms down near the assembly line with hundreds of extremely thin needles. It didn’t make more of a move as it scanned the belt underneath. 

The railgun seemed of standard make, barring its ridiculous size. Not much stood out about it other than a few components missing and another few not properly slitted into the frame.

And fortunately, nothing moved in the darkness.~</span>

As the hall glowed the bright orange, the mirage turned with the rest of the group to see the  holographic limbo appear in the air above them, &quot;well....this is different&quot; she said calmly  though she wondered if this was being displayed in real time or was set as a recording she joined the frost  and the vauban.

She turned her head looking back at the other frost and rhino motioning silently for them to join, but couldn&#39;t see the wukong tenno only remembering he had ran off into another room in his energetic fashion.</span>

“Whoa there!”

I swiftly jump backwards on my left foot - like a frightened cat - the second the mechanical hand whirred to life. My arms flail in front of me to rest in a boxer like stance, ready to smack the thing in to oblivion while my right leg lifts in the air, coiling beneath my rump and lifting it in a angle forwards to act like a shield. But…

I stop in my battle ready stance and blink, observing the contraption direct it’s needles bellow to whatever that is supposed to be on the conveyer belt.

“Oh… HA HA”

I let out a loud chuckle and relax my posture, lowering my arms and leg, breaking the stance.

“You sneaky paypapk! Scared the blue off-“

I cut off my words as a unfamiliar voice spews from the hallway, making me tilt my head towards the doorway of the room I’m currently in. <em>”Warframe test station?! Huh huh? Test? What test? We fight?! Explore?! Oooooooooo</em>”

The rail gun got pushed out of my head as I quickly hop out of the room on my toes, going down the hallway in silent strides before reaching the others as they started to gather round. In one last, grand leap, I plop down next to the Mirage and smile, my Wukong’s silver fangs reflecting the fiery orange that danced through the hall

I direct my gaze upwards towards the projected Limbo and trace his frame with my greedy eyes, looking for any specifics that pulls him away from the rest of his kind.</span>

The MOA stepped back immediately as the pedestal blazed to life, Aurelia bracing herself for an assault. What she got, however, was far more of a shock. The Limbo that stood before her was not immediately recognizable through the orange-tinted display, but the voice was unmistakable. Disruptis, the Tenno that had been mysteriously absent from the final battle, and the same voice that she had heard from the original signal that had brought her here. She had had her concerns that all of this was an elaborate hoax, meant to draw any surviving members of the Remnant out of hiding. She was still not entirely convinced, but this image was very persuasive. However, the only real hope she had lay in the thought that Disruptis himself was aboard this station somewhere, and that the two of them would be able to meet in person. They had never been formally introduced, so she decided to make use of that advantage and keep her connections a secret for the time being, as it was too soon to determine if this was indeed a ruse or not. The image promised an explanation of some kind, so Aurelia listened attentively, ignoring the other members of the group.</span>

The orange and white Frost braced himself as well, but relaxed soon after the small projection began to speak. He stayed quiet until it finished, then spoke.

&quot;So that confirms it&#39;s a test, which is good news. Uh, is everyone here?&quot;

He glanced around, noticing the Wukong from earlier had returned. &quot;Ah there you are. I was gonna have to go after you otherwise.&quot;</span>

“Alright well, this is a recording so I have no idea if anyone’s listening or not. I guess I’ll start my explanation now and loop the video later somehow.”

He reached a hand over and adjusted the salix syandana on his back. “So!” he continued, clasping his hands together in front, “You all were picked from a list of Tenno longer than my guandao to join the Corporation. Instead of worrying about the semantics of real interview Q and A, this’ll be the way to decide if everyone is fit to join. Everyone should be able to pass, so most of the test is to see how much ass each person respectively kicks, and what training you need going forward.”

The Limbo stopped his pacing and leaned backwards onto something not shown in the hologram. “And some of you may be insulted by that. The thought that you need more training, after all these years of grueling war. However, the battlefield we at RU Corp fight has changed. I’ll let you know more about that on the other side.”

“But anyway,” he continued, shaking his head as if trying to get rid of the rabbit trail he just took them on, “here’s the scenario. You are here with no knowledge of where this station came from or what’s on board it. Which I guess is basically already the scenario but muck it, I’ll say it again. You only know that it has been flagged for abnormal plausibility. Basically, we think there might be an enemy with abilities the likes of which we’ve never seen before. Your objective is to find if there is, and if so, to figure out a way to safely contain or otherwise get it in position to be immobilized so retrieval is safe to handle it. This includes finding out at least someway retrieval <em>can</em> safely handle it. Oh, you can also try to find out what exactly happened to this station. This is set up to be as realistic as possible, and since all of it is pulled from past encounters, I can assure you it is authentic.”

We at RU Corp will not be held responsible for death or dismemberment of any warframes, but we’re sorry for partially lying to you all. If any of you wish to leave merely place two hands on the entrance door and hold it for a full minute. It will open and give you just enough time to get out.”

I stand and listen to his words with my arms crossed over my chest, occasionally nodding here and there to the important bits of information. At the mention of the current scenario I managed to stiffen a high excited squeal that threatened to rumbled from my throat…instead the others around me might hear a little whine come out <em>”Ahahahaaaaaa! Yes yes! I love this! It’s a hunt! YEEEEEEES! So much FUN!</em>”

A explosion of expressions started to flip across my Wukong’s face, from happy to excited, to a grin and then breaking out in to a all out laugh as the Limbo stopped speaking.

“Yes! I love puzzles! Mysteries!”

I throw my arms up in the air in to fist pumps and do a little hop in place, not able to contain this bubbling storm inside. My gaze turning to dance around the others, to see if they’re as excited as I am.</span>

That&#39;s only a bit better.&quot; Kamos grunted, struggling with the pronunciation of one of the words a little bit. &quot;This could still be dangerous. If this is some sort of test, it&#39;s probably not gonna be simple. What&#39;re they gonna do, though? Throw cannon fodder at us? Been there, done that.&quot;

Kamos started fidgeting with the Lex pistol he was carrying, struggling to think of ideas again. What should the plan of attack be? What should he be prepared for? Would these RU folks object to some collateral damage, if it comes to it? Did any of the other Tenno try to bring pets with them? Were those pets going to get stuck in any air vents?</span>

The others seemed to be at the very least intrigued, if not outright excited by the prospect presented to them. Aurelia, on the other hand, was more apprehensive. It sounded to her like this was going to be at least partially a combat test of sorts, one meant for Warframes. It went without saying that her MOA proxy was not going to have an easy time with this. In fact, if she charged in blindly the MOA would likely get shredded immediately. It seemed then that she would have to rely upon her present company to make sure she survived this trial. Everyone seemed to be speculating  on just what the test would hold, as she was. However, speculation would only carry them so far. She tried to get the MOA into the closest thing to a diginified position that she could, then she addressed the group.

&quot;Well everyone, might I suggest we move on? I doubt this message will tell us much else.&quot;</span>

&quot;Ah, pardon me, forgot to shut that off.&quot; With a final command, Aurelia deactivated the pedestal altogether, before closing the command prompt for the device. letting out a small, exasperated sigh, she turned her attention back to the assembled group. &quot;Now then, shall we?

My smile remained on my Wukong’s face as everyone weighed in their opinions and words. How are they not just exploding with excitement like I am?!  It&#39;s new, it&#39;s a maze! I just want to hit the road as soon as possible and sniff around this facility as well as look for that pimple that is supposedly roaming about! My gaze lifts to the Mars scented Frost as he called for a roll-call and I just make a “wtf” expression, not believing that he hadn&#39;t caught on the names of the others from the previous time. Observation is key to survival! Deduction! Subtle hints! Scan and remember the surrounding!

Finding none of the patience for standing around even MORE and doing NOTHING – not when there are MYSTERIES TO BE EXPLORED -  I smack a hand on to my chest to grab his attention as well as anyone around me.

“Sonera, melee expert.”

I say briefly, cause right now it feels like every word spoken is a moment stolen from the mission <em>”We wait here, we talk, we dwindle! It’s out there! Find it! Catch it! Oh! It’s fun fun!</em>”

I lift a hand to point towards the Moa

“Aurelia, little cutie!”

My hand drops to my side and I point towards the hardened Rhino with my chin.

“That there Kamos, no bullshit man from what I see, I like like!”

My gaze dips towards the Vauban and the other less Mars looking Frost

“Chegar and Svy…something! I dunno! They’re cool!”

I stop and look back at Leveret

“Alright Retty? Let’s go let’s go! Every moment counts, split up, search?”

My gaze jumps around the others, trying to gauge their thoughts.</span>

&quot;Alright...&quot; The frost began, looking among the crowd, before looking to Sonera.
&quot;Splitting the group may only work if what were looking for here can occur in multiple locations at once. And given the indication we could get pretty jacked up at this point, the most we would do is teams of two to three.&quot;
&quot;Not to mention, we don&#39;t have a full map yet.&quot; Chegar said, still looking at the pedestal, thinking about the message they had been left.

&quot;Unfortunately, there was nothing else on that pedestal, and it seemed to be isolated on this network. Additionally, I would discourage separating unless absolutely necessary, as we don&#39;t know exactly what we supposed to fight against here. It would be better if we could have all the various talents of this group available, rather than putting ourselves in the position of needing someone who is out of reach.&quot; Aurelia paused, before remembering the Frost&#39;s suggestion. &quot;As the more excitable Tenno, erm, Sonera, said, my name is Aurelia, cephalon. I specialize in medical knowledge, but I am functional dealing with technological problems.&quot; The MOA bent one of its legs and tilted forward, attempting to bow to the rest of the group.</span>

If there had seen anything important back there, Aurelia had a feeling that Tenno would have told them. &quot;In any case, we seem to be essentially blind to what&#39;s in store for us, so why don&#39;t we just pick a direction and start walking?

“A-AH!”

I exclaim with a vibrant hop in place, perking up at the mention of my name. I lift a hand and point to the general direction of the last room I explored

“Yes yes! I saw! I noticed little machines building something on a belt…it was big and pointy…maybe a cracker?”

I tilt my head to the side <em>”No no, crackers are bigger! But wait! Maybe there are tinny ones?!”</em> I let out a low chuckle and swat a hand in front of my face, as if swatting these thoughts away. But then! It hit me! I vigorously lift my arm in the air and wave it around, shouting

“DIBS ON THE MOA! ANDELE ANDELE!”

Without another word I spring on my heels and pounce towards the last green lit door that I haven’t explored yet, hoping the cute Moa follows close behind</span>

The white and orange Frost followed Sonera into the room, kicking a few tools out of his path with his foot as his headlamp panned over the room.

&quot;This place looks abandoned,&quot; he commented, peering at a MOA, &quot;wonder if it&#39;s set up, or if everyone left in a hurry?&quot;</span>

The MOA stepped gingerly into the larger room, taking in the mess around her.
&quot;I doubt that any technician or mechanic would willingly leave their workplace so... Unorganized. Remember what that Limbo had said, this place is meant to be authentic, so it seems unlikely that this would be set up. &quot; She paced the floor as she spoke, scanning the room for anything that seemed especially out of place. &quot;In other words,&quot; she continued, &quot;whatever it is that we&#39;re supposed to find here is likely the culprit. Perhaps a battle  took place here?&quot;</span>

Sauntering in behind Sonera, she started looking around what seemed like a very large mechanics workstation with the multiple variations of MOA&#39;s  either sitting snugly in a dock, or just crumpled in a mass of metal on the floor.  Taking a quick scan around the room as the cephalon spoke, Inari couldn&#39;t see any plasma burns that would coincide any kind of battle taking place, &quot;not sure on that cephalon, as far as i can see, there are no signs of any battle, no blood, no plasma burns, nothing....&quot; 

She turned to the others, the emerald glimmer of her Mirage&#39;s eyes glowing in the dimness of the room, &quot;whatever happened, the people in here got out in one void of a hurry&quot;</span>

My Wukong&#39;s  face lit up with a expression mimicking that of a hungry predator, my gaze drifts around to room, eating any morsel that might catch my interest...and they stopped on one of the walls  that seemed...out of place? I tilt my head to the side <em>&quot;Oh? What&#39;s that what&#39;s that?!&quot;</em>

I quickly zoom inside the room, side stepping and twirling around the debris on the floor. <em>&quot;A twirl here, a twist here, jump over that! Yes yes!</em>&quot;

As I was passing a torn off Moa leg, I gracefully bend down - just as I was passing it - and pick it up in one smooth motion with my left hand, like that of a Condor picking up a vermin.

I straighten up and plop it to dangle from my left shoulder all the while not breaking out of my hops and skips as I make my way towards the wall.

With a hum and a lean, I gaze at the writing...which to me makes no sense. I straighten up and look back over my shoulder towards the small group that has started to gather and follow after me

&quot;Hey hey! Something here&quot;

I point with my index finger of my free hand towards the writing, taking a couple of steps to the side so that all can see

&quot;Tell tell! What it says?!&quot;</span>

Aurelia sidestepped Sonera as she rushed past, then watched the others attempt to solve the riddle. She had the capability to translate Grineer text, not that she wanted to waste any resources on such an ugly language. The contents of the words, however, vexed her. Why would a Grineer, of all creatures write riddles on a wall? Especially one that was so cryptic? The suggestions of the Frost and Vauban gave her food for thought.

&quot;It seems unlikely that the Grineer would know about Archimedian Margulis, much less have enough respect for her to write cryptic riddles about her.&quot; She chimed in. &quot;It is possible that they are referring to a kind of sight that does not rely on visible light. Sonar perhaps?&quot;</span>

&quot;I&#39;ve seen some Veil assassins write in blood, and I think I once watched a Manic turn a crewman into abstract art, but I&#39;ve never seen something like <em>this</em> before. Who would go through the trouble to write in Grineer when all you have is blood? Why not Corpus? Or Tenno?&quot; All those blocky letters. There was no way this was one person&#39;s blood, was it? While everyone else was busy with the likely-complicated message, Kamos inspected the room in an attempt to find a body, or multiple bodies. This was probably just a test, but there might still be some corpses around here. Or at least, he thought so.</span>

When merely gazed at, it appeared to have been encrusted long ago, but touching it was a different story. Inari and Leveret’s fingers came away slick with wet hemoglobin, the areas touched began to trickle streams down to the floor for a few seconds before hardening the new stains.

The response of Sonera’s knocks seemed normal for a wall, not that anyone goes knocking on them for analysis that often. Or, maybe that was something in of itself. It sounded just like knocking on any of the other walls in the room, despite being drastically different.

Luckily Kamos didn’t find a body. However, in the far corner of the room, through the thick machinery and cluttered floor, he did find a Moa with some of its lights partially on.~</span>

U push myself off the wall , frowning, since my knocks did little to reveal anything about the out-of-place slab. My gaze drifts towards Leveret as his fingers dripped with crimson. <em>”Hm…weird yes yes…adaptive? Something that changes?</em>”

I ponder but my gaze goes back to the wall yet again, not able to shake off the weirdness of it. Maybe they ran out of corpus walls and build a Grineer one? Weird yes yes…by chance or by purpose?

“Anyone got a scan thingy?”

I look around the room at the gathered Tenno and the Moa, maybe a scanner might dig up something else about the wall or room.</span>

Maybe one of the more tech-savvy people can get something from the moa. Kamos, though, wasn&#39;t even gonna bother. He&#39;d probably just break it even more.

Aurelia flinched slightly at the other MOA being dropped in front of her and the rest of the group. While it may have held some information they could use, the other Tenno seemed perfectly capable of prying whatever information it had to offer from its memory. The blood on the wall, however, was of far greater interest to her. She had noticed that the blood had appeared dry, and yet the Frost had managed to smear some on their fingers. By all accounts, normal blood shouldn&#39;t be able to do that. She moved closer to the wall, before calling to the Frost.

She jumped back quickly her arm reaching back to unhook her cernos from it&#39;s holster, by the grace of the long combat she endured through. Backing up quickly to the rest of the group she pulled out a single arrow from her quiver, nocking the four pronged arrow to her bow keeping the string held firm in her hand, &quot;what in the void is this?&quot; 

She asked more openly than to anyone specifically, her arrow faced the ground but her fingers itched, gently tugging at the string, she could feel the muscles in her mirage&#39;s arm twitching almost begging for one of the MOA to attack them so the frame could loose the arrow and bury it into one of their view scopes.</span>

Well…I was definitely not prepared for this.

At the sudden appearance of the heart stopping noise all kind of alarms went off in my head, all warning me of danger and the need to SILENCE IT. My jaw and body clenches and I shoot up to cover my ears, letting the moa leg I previously scooped off the floor to drop down…even tho…my frame has no ears…but it’s a reflex reaction to the overwhelming noise. <em>”MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP</em>” I felt this need to escape rise up, escape from the noise, from the feeling

<strong>Adus (Dresden)</strong>
“Crowd control”

<strong>Sonera</strong>
I hear…just a silver of my Cephalons words through the endless static and I look around at the others, yelling at the top of my lungs

“STUN THEM!”

Hoping the Frost or some of the other frames that have crowd control to take care of the situation…or at least…calm it.</span>

In the midst of the hellish chorus, however, she could hear something. Something consistent. In a moment of inspiration, she took a brief audio sample of the still-screaming MOAs and analyzed it every way she knew how. Most of her attempts yielded nothing of use, but one pinged out a positive, recognizable result.</span>

A railgun MOA that was missing a leg propped itself up as best as it could and opened fire on Leveret’s back. Another one leaped up into the air and straddled Kamos’s shoulders, administering a flurry of oddly powerful headbuts right to the Tenno’s head. Three completely amputated MOA heads fired a volley of plasma at Inari from their stacked position on the ground, while Sonera was jumped by a headless shockwave MOA’s hearty kick to the gut. 

Two attack drones previously resting on one of the far shelves now whisked through the air above the chaos, raining energy bullets down on the area. Even Aurelia found herself assaulted by a very determined shield osprey which was trying its best to dive bomb the cephalon. Curiously, it wasn’t delivering a shield boost to the other units in the room.</span>

Several shots from various moss warped their courses to collide harmlessly with Leveret’s dented shield, leaving blackened marks on the already scuffed white paint.

Unfortunately his ack/brunt only let him prepare for frontal attacks. In his hunched position, the railgun MOA’s first shot hit him in the shoulder blade.</span>

The MOA wasn&#39;t the only one capable of headbutting. Stumbling a bit from the multiple attacks, Kamos let out a rather fierce roar, before smashing his forehead into the MOA as hard as he could. What, you think a damaged MOA could out-headbutt Kamos? He immediately followed that up with grabbing onto the MOA&#39;s limbs, removing the robot from his face (and maybe the limbs from the MOA, I dunno).

Kamos was about to start breaking some more MOAs, but saw the door doing that thing. These MOAs seemed boring, so why should he waste time on them when the rest of these Tenno had it handled? Instead, Kamos focused his attention on the door. If things got any worse, everyone else was going to need an escape route. He ran over to the door, going into a slide as he got closer. Timing his slide so he would be under the doorway right when it was opening, he rolled back to his feet and got a firm grip on the opening/closing door. Standing up to his full height, he forced the door open with his Frame&#39;s considerable strength. That door probably wasn&#39;t gonna be closing again easily.</span>

I couldn’t care less about their intention, all I want is for that racket to STOP! However, before I could say anything to the Frost, to encourage him to continue with his casting, the Moas all went berserk and started jumping on us…which caused a devilish smirk to spread across my Wukong’s face <em>”ThEy ArEn’T oUr EnEmIes, ThEy NeEd OuR hElP. BAH!”</em> I was just about to let out a laugh but a unexpected kick to the gut sent me flying backwards, causing me to thump against the wall behind me and slide down to my knees.

“HAH! NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT!”

I holler and grab hold of the Moa leg from the floor, the one I held on to previously. Pushing myself forward from my crouched position I reach out to forcefully whack the headless shockwave Moa and topple it over so that I can deliver one harsh stomp on to it’s core and crack it.</span>

The Frost recoiled, resisting the urge to grab at his shin.  He quickly leaped away from the moa&#39;s
&quot;{Cheg, Please tell me you got something.}&quot;
Chegar arrived in time to see the doors slamming open and closed.
&quot;{Uh...Maybe. Try talking with them. I&#39;ll see if I can get the doors secured.}&quot; Chegar replied, beginning to look for an access hatch near the door; Regardless of Kamos&#39;s strength, Chegar wasn&#39;t taking any chances.
Svytoj then looked out at the Moa&#39;s, to a sharp breath, and tried his hand at, for once, actually being a Cephalon. Another burst of screeching audio flooded the room.

She felt the three blasts hit her chest directly, her frames body shield taking the full brunt of the damage.  &quot;Yeah these guys look like they need help for sure&quot; 

Focusing her void energy Inari felt the energy seethe out from the mirage slowly  replicating her warframe bringing forth four shadow replicas of herself to throw off the MOA&#39;s sensors. Quickly drawing the pronged arrow from her quiver, the tenno fired off a quick shot putting the power of the void into two of her shadows making the one arrow into three. Each of the arrows striking the stack of robots sending the pile toppling over on itself. &quot;So does anyone have a solution to this little issue before we get over run by the robot zombies?&quot;</span>

Aurelia tried her best to duck away from the osprey that was harassing her. This. This right here was why she hated being involved in situations like this. Of course, barely any of the Tenno were even listening at this point, with the Wukong demolishing several of the MOAs at the moment and the Rhino had effectively ditched the group entirely.  Her frustration was building, up until another burst of audio flooded the room. While she didn&#39;t appreciate the likely damage to her audio sensors, she hoped it would have the desired effect.</span>

Unfortunately, ripping its thick legs off was not such an easy task, and he only managed to dislocate its joints a little. As it floundered around on the floor, Kamos found himself nearly buckling under the force from the closing door. Metal screeched. It had changed its approach and now fully pressed down upon him, trying to squash the warframe.

Sonera’s assault felled the shockwave MOA, but it achieved one last heavy kick to her guts as its core shattered beneath her feet. Shots rang out. The attack drones launched a volley of bullets her way, but some of them were whisked away an inch away from Sonera’s face by Leveret’s shield. 

There was no access hatch on the door that Chegar could see, and the mounted console was acting very funny. It&#39;s UI glitched and kept changing the text on various buttons. The words were garbled, but every few seconds one would change to say &quot;LOCK&quot;. Meanwhile, Inari’s arrows stuck true, sending the stack of MOA heads flying across the darkened workstation and crashing into a pile of spare parts. Then, a couple bullets from the attack drones thumped against her shields as well.

Leveret’s back burned as the railgun MOA scorched it from behind with a quickly spooling laser. With each of Aurelia’s dodges, the osprey smacked into the floor or wall, shook itself, then went in for another dive. This continued until Svytoj cranked his message into high gear, causing it to freeze in its tracks. Unfortunately, it and the MOA currently attached to Svytoj’s leg were the only ones out of the bunch that the message seemed to have an effect on. The others continued attacking.

Kamos could see his previous assailant picking itself up off the floor in front of him.</span>

The frost grunted loudly in response to the burning sensation on his back caused by the MOA&#39;s shot. He backed up to a better position, prepared to deflect any other oncoming shots as he raised his fist in preparation to freeze the room.

“HA! How about tha-OOF!”

I let out a gasp as the unexpected kick wobbled me backwards, but a quick reposition of my right leg behind me, I manage to keep myself upright…tho, that hurt! Damn those Moas and their powerful legs! Like fricking boxers or something! 

I grit my teeth, my left arm dipping down to clutch on to my throbbing gut. Hearing shots, my head lifts up to spot the firing drones. “Hek!” I quickly crouch down and lift me left arm over my head for protection, knowing full well I won’t be able to dodge it in time so better to make the hit surface as small as possible. Lucky for me tho, some shots just turned inches from my head. PHEW. The one that landed seared across my left side…maybe I should have popped Defy <em>”Supid stupid!</em>”

I grab on to some loose screws from the floor as I keep my crouched pose, and fling them towards the drone that fired on me with a strong zip of my wrist, hoping it would at least stun it or topple it to the floor.</span>

Aurelia had had quite enough of these drones. Their message from before had briefly touched her heart, but their continued aggression was quickly spoiling any goodwill she had towards them. Taking advantage of a gap in the Osprey&#39;s attacks, she called back to Leveret.

&quot;I may have one more idea we can try. If it doesn&#39;t work, then you have my express permission to turn these nuisances into scrap metal!&quot; Her voice was clearly irritated. They may have been a source of vital information, but she was almost beyond the point of caring. She turned towards the Frost who had emitted that signal just moments before. As she did, she noticed an odd stillness amidst the chaos: two of these drones had stopped dead in their tracks, including the Osprey that had been attacking her, and they were now idling among their swarming brethren. Inspired, she tried to get Svytoj&#39;s attention.

&quot;Excuse me, Tenno? I&#39;m not sure how you managed to do that, but would you be willing to try it again? It seems your first attempt had some success. If I duplicate your signal, and we both broadcast it simultaneously, we might be able to get through to them!&quot; It was a long shot, but she couldn&#39;t think with this infernal racket going on.</span>

Okay, this might hurt, but... Focusing for a precious few seconds, Kamos surrounded himself in that extra layer of armor that Iron Skin gave him, and prepared to do something really stupid. How was that new for Kamos, though? Letting out a fierce roar once again, Kamos reached for his Lex pistol and dropped to a kneeling position, propping the door on his own shoulders. Firing all six shots into the MOA as fast as the gun would fire. Now, of course, there was a metric ton of bad stuff that could happen here, but Kamos wasn&#39;t going to ask for help. That wouldn&#39;t be very Kamos of him. Instead, this was his plan.</span>

The shot charging inside its barrel disapperated violently, burning a hole inside. The MOA took one last step forward and toppled over to the ground, emitting a high-pitched whine as its final circuits lost their sparks of life.

Meanwhile, Chegar’s trip wires were working, providing just enough relief to stop the door from cracking into Kamos’s Iron Skin. A very welcome gesture, as after the death of the MOA the door seemed to only increase in power. 

<em>Thud</em>. An attack drone was thrown back against a wall from Sonera’s improvised weaponry. The other one started to buzz around more angrily and keep the pressure on the Wukong. Four more shots managed to plaster themselves along the warframe’s shields.

She lowered her bow watching the robots drop slowly hearing the signal from the vauban and the groups MOA transmit out. 
She slid behind a table to not be an easy line of sight for the osprey as she looked over to the MOA, &quot;What in the void was that?&quot;. She asked in a matter-of-fact kind of way, drawing another arrow she aimed up at the mechs &quot;what did you two tell these machines?&quot;</span>

Aurelia stepped back from the hovering Osprey, feeling supremely uncomfortable at it being so close. In a brief moment, she had deciphered  the final message from the drones, finding it as cryptic as the last. At the very least, she was happy that most of the noise had ceased, at least for the moment.  Hearing the Mirage&#39;s question, Aurelia turned towards her.

&quot;We didn&#39;t have to say very much.&quot; She began, &quot;Essentially, we asked them what they wanted, and we agreed to help them if we could.&quot; Aurelia took several strides towards Svytoj, eyeing him curiously. &quot;Putting all that aside for a moment, what I would like to know is how a Tenno was capable of performing that feat, especially when they do not have a Warframe that would lend itself to a sonic attack. So Tenno, how exactly did you do that?&quot;</span>

The threat of the MOA removed, Kamos dropped his pistol to free up his hands. With all of the (truly absurd) strength he could muster, Kamos attempted to stand back up again against the relentless onslaught of this door. Once he was mostly stood up, he got a firm grip on the door once again. Ha, no door can defeat Kamos! Well, unless vents count as doors, and hyekkas get involved... Anyway, Kamos left the empty Lex pistol at his feet, silently hoping someone would pick it up and hand it to him eventually. No rush, though. He was busy fighting this door.</span>

Aiming a short beam of ice at the edge of the door mechanism, Leveret raced over and slid under the door as well, adding his own strength to the attempt.

“Fricking-“

A low grumble slipped by my lips as the other drone let loose it’s own barrage, hitting my chest area. Feeling annoyed by these flying insects, I use my crouched position like a string, to powerfully leap in the air, towards the drone. And like a jumping cat, I use my hands to grab on to the machine firmly. As I fall down, I bring it down with my weight and using the momentum of the fall – along with my added strength – I brutally bash it on the floor with a violent smack-down, breaking it in to metallic pieces that scatter around.

“HA!”

I boom with a gleaming smile, lifting my head to look around. Noticing the FINALLY welcoming silence and the flopping of the other machines…causing me to frown

“Dawwww….no more? Bah!”

I wave my hand in front of me and crouch down to shuffle through the aftermath of the fight. Picking up stray shards and useful bolts for any…uh….further interruption. Seeing as how I haven’t brought any weapons with me, stocking up on improvised throwing stars and metal knives is a good move.

I scurry around on the floor on all fours, not minding anyone as I search about.</span>

The three managed to pry it all the way open, but it was still giving them resistance at the top. If they moved, it could come crashing down again.

Meanwhile, the last attack drone shook out of its shock of impact. It locked on Sonera and loaded the warframe’s torso with ten plasmic bolts.</span>

“Hm hm hmmmmm picking up nails, picking up nails hm hm hmmm-OW WHAT THE-“

I snarl as my back seared up with shots as I was picking up one more nail from the floor. A angry grumble rumbles from my throat as I look over my shoulder to the culprit. “Fricking” I stand up, stashing everything I gathered so far in to my gear compartment, and outstretch my staff outwards, towards it, poking it out of the sky. Using it’s moment of stagger I leap in the air and, using both of my heels, I land on top of it, using the force of my kicks along with my falling body weight to shatter it.

But wait…that’s not the end! I stomp at it’s corpse, again and again, till nothing of it’s hull remains but pieces

“Fricking”

Stomp

“Rude”

Stomp

“To”

Stomp

“Interrupt”

How did you do it!?&quot; Aurelia&#39;s barrage of questions was interrupted by the brief scrap between Sonera and the remaining hostile Osprey. Mildly disturbed by Sonera&#39;s excessive show of force against such a weak target, she stammered, trying to get her train of thought back on track.

&quot;Erm, yes, thank you Sonera. Perhaps we should move on, before anything else shows itself.&quot; Aurelia sent the MOA towards the door, carefully passing between the Tenno currently holding the door at bay.</span>

Save the entrance, where the door continued its heated battle with the Tenno, but was now in the act of losing its fight. Kamos and Leveret managed to keep it open between the two of them.</span>

My fingers coiling around this axe shaped metal scrap, a jagged edge going along one side of it, sharp enough to be used as a improvised weapon for close quarters.

I stand up and admire the rough “craftmanship” twirling it between my hands like a coin.

“Eh?”

I pause and look up towards the group as they start pooling outside of the room, jumping past the chomping door.

“Wait wait…what about text? See without eyes? No more here?”

I look over my shoulder to the wall in question. Seems like a shame to just leave after all of that….there is definetly something in this room… or maybe? Yes yes!

However, seeing as how time is of essense here, I quickly make my way towards the others, performing a graceful air twirl to hop over the  Rhino and plop down on my heels on the other side</span>

Looking back into the room she couldn&#39;t help but wonder if that riddle was for that room or for something else in the labyrinth of deadly playthings, &quot;Though if i may, i think we may just want to hold onto the thought of the riddle and continue our search, we still have the other side of the hallway to explore as well.&quot;</span>

I smiled, hopping in place as if a enormous realization just hit me

“A-ah! Yes yes! I found room with little ones building a big one! Pointy as well! I think the hall goes more! Didn&#39;t managed to go past it”

I say in my hyper tone, pointing down the hall at the room I explored

“But…wait wait! Anyone did the scan thingy?”

I press my arms firmly against my sites and jokingly start turning around my axis, emulating how a warframe behaves when a scanner is pulled out and scanning with the zoom</span>

Kamos glared at the door for a moment, after doing a quick headcount. He was almost mostly sure that maybe most of the group was here. Eh, close enough. He was more preoccupied that he had almost been beaten by a door. A <em>door</em>. Not anything particularly dangerous, but a <em>door</em>. He didn&#39;t like this door anymore. After a few more seconds of glaring, Kamos delivered a rather powerful kick to the door out of spite. After that, well... he waited for someone to figure out where the group should go next.</span>

&quot;Well that was exciting. And here I was wishing for some action. So, we got some zombie MOAs and a cryptic message on a wall, in Grineer.&quot;

He watched as Kamos kicked the door. &quot;So uh....where to now? Sonera, was it? You said something about...building?&quot; he asked, seeming to have a little trouble keeping up with how fast the Wukong spoke.</span>

&quot;Not to worry Sonera dear,&quot; she chimed in, &quot;everything this MOA has seen, including the riddle and the scans I managed to conduct will be held in its own internal memory, so we will have access to it going forward. As for our next course of action...&quot; She peered down the hallway, towards the other room that Sonera indicated. &quot;I, for one, am in no hurry to be locked inside another room with those shrieking automatons, especially if there is indeed a larger one inside. Perhaps we should venture further down this hallway instead? Her voice held some measure of composure, but the slightest tinge of worry showed through.

I pause in my spinning antics to look towards the Frost that spoke to me and lifted a finger to answer him but then the MOA chimmed in, causing that trademark smile to spread across my face, the sharp metallic fangs backing in to their corners.

“Ah yes yes! Very good! Look, record! Might want a copy!”

I chuckled before throwing my right fist up in a powerful pose, shouting

“Now! Let’s go go!”

I boast and as before, dart down the hallway to explore further than the other two rooms I managed to look through before the madness. What? Standing around and discussing is BORING! With each step I make, I twirl the improvised axe in my left hand, round and round my index finger like a deadly and sharp spinner.</span>

sighs loudly extending an arm out grabbing the wukong before he could get any further down the hallway, pulling him back to the rest of the group, excitement was good, but she would rather prefer excitement with a solid plan. &quot;ok fellas and cephalon, before mister spastastic here goes running off possibly getting us into something else, let&#39;s make a solid strategy on what we wanna do, I personally would rather be in a open space with room to move and not trapped in a closed space with possible waking zombie robots&quot;

She looked at the crew for a second and gave her own idea &quot;I say to use the internal memory in that MOA we do a quick scan and sweep at least at the entrance way to the rooms, we keep a guard outside,  the cephalon and two of us can go into the room to let it get in a decent scan of the room and we move to the next, with this we can possibly have a map of the immediate area&quot;</span>

Aurelia stood among the Tenno, nodding along to the Mirage&#39;s plan. It was nice to have something at least resembling a plan in this situation. 
&quot;If we are choosing a guard, might I suggest someone who could hold a door open? I have no desire to be locked into one of these room, screeching robots or no. That said, Svytoj is correct. Perhaps one of the bodyguards that will come with me can handle that portion of the investigation?&quot; If the last room was anything to go by, one Tenno should be more than sufficient to handle the defense of the other two members.</span>

“HURK!”

I gasped as a unexpected hand reached out to grab me by the tail and stop me from my galavanting. I swiftly look over my shoulder to the perpetrator and frown, the improvised axe head stopping it’s twirling in my hand as I grip on to it tightly…almost cutting deep in to my fingers.

Letting out a long sigh and with a slump of my shoulders, I stay put…for now! Till they have their boring talks!</span>

The tenno internally sighed within the comfort of her orbiter, having everyone on the same page instead of wandering this station like of of bunch of condrocs with their heads chopped off, letting go of the wukong&#39;s tail she turned toward the new heading, and to start their mapping of the area. &quot;Alright so Sonera, and I will go in with the cephalon into each room, Leveret, Kamos will stand by the door just in case it decides to shut on us again&quot;

She looked at the other frost and Vauban tilting her head for a second, &quot;hmm, umm  chegar was it? since your in that frame it may be best if you stay outside in case we need any security, and svy can join with the room team&quot; 

She scanned the group seeing if anyone else had any other thoughts on the set up on the team or if everyone was hopefully on the same wavelength as her, &quot;This ok with everyone?&quot; She asked.</span>

&quot;Still, doubt most of you can handle bodyguard duty. Eh, whatever, fine.&quot; Kamos muttered, after looking around the group. Maybe Leveret and that other Frost, but besides that...

At the mention of my name, my head perks up and anything said after that I managed to listen to.

“Yes yes! I can guard!”

I quickly boast glancing at the adorable Moa that I’ll protect. <em>”Yes yes! Protect till the last Defy POP!”</em>

My gaze drifts towards the Rhino and his grumpy words, causing a smirk to spread across my mouth piece, finding his words just the cutest thing! <em>”Dawwww! He plays the tough card! Cute cute!</em>”

“Oh come come! No fun in grouching, no no! Let go! Run with it eh? More fun! More excite!”

I boom towards him and look at the Moa, waiting for this to finally get going!</span>

“I’m.... not a cephalon... but I can still run security.”

Meanwhile, Svytoj  was still giggling silently to himself. He took a breath, and looked at Inari.

As the group began to talk amongst themselves, Aurelia felt some measure of reassurance. Perhaps this would not be as impossible as she expected. This Wukong, Sonera, was certainly an eccentric being, but Aurelia had little doubt in her combat prowess. Feeling enthused by the prospect of moving along, she decided to pipe up again.

&quot;Right, it sounds like it is settled! Sonera, Svytoj, Inari and I will enter this next room and take a quick look around while Leveret and Kamos mind the door and make sure we aren&#39;t separated.&quot; She turned to face Kamos next. 
&quot;Kamos, I understand that you value your autonomy, but this situation requires us to work together somewhat cohesively. Please, bear with us for the time being.&quot;</span>

“Let’s go let’s go! Me and front and you…”

I hop and skip and jump, heading towards the last room I explored, that had all of those tinny machines building a big one.

“Here here!”

I boom and hop inside it, walking along the right wall, making sure not to trigger anything…if I can!

Seeing the Wukong already in a room she sighed looking at the rest of the group whom she assumed were just as puzzled at the spry frame, while he walking into the room, &quot;well come on everyone before he gets in trouble again,might as well go cover his tail&quot;

She slightly chuckled at the little pun , as she motioned everyone forward with her cernos in hand, keeping an eye over her shoulder pauldron making sure the path behind them was still clear of any surprises that may want to try and come out and greet the small rag tag group.</span>

Reaching the door with the MOA she stepped in first, mildly watching the wukong bouncing around the room with his almost supernatural zeal and energy, &#39;well let&#39;s get this party started then&#39; , she said looking down at the MOA, waiting on the cephalon to start her initial scan of the room.

Looking around, a small sense of curiosity gripped her, watching the small machines moving constantly building other machines in almost an endless cycle of construction, &#39;so was this an old Corpus production site?&#39; she said aloud in a general fashion for anyone to hear.</span>

Leveret deduced that most machines on the line performed three functions. One was to rotate whatever object was on the line to a better position, another was to add some sort of another part to it, and the last was to solder said parts on. Curiously, nothing could be found to indicate where each machine got its materials and parts from.

Aurelia quickly discovered a console sitting on the beginning of the assembly line. It had previously been hidden from line of sight, and it didn&#39;t seem to be on.~</span>

I shrugged to the question the Mirage worded

“Don’t know don’t know, all I want to know is this!”

I bounce along the right hand wall of the room (probably tripping some things along since AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR CAREFUL), towards the pointy menacing looking thing sitting at the end of the assembly line, stopping a few paces from it.

As Aurelia surveyed the room, a few observations came to mind: first, from what she could tell, this room was obviously a production room of some sort, though what was made here wasn&#39;t readily apparent. Hearing that Inari was on a similar line of thought, she decided to contribute.

&quot;It likely was, though I&#39;m not entirely sure what they were making here ultimately.&quot; Aurelia paused, examining the partially assembled railgun sitting on the belt. Though incomplete, she swore she had seen this particular model before. &quot;I think I may have an idea. This room very well may have been where the robots we encountered earlier were created. If my memory is correct, Corpus crewmen do not typically carry railguns like this, only their robotics, particularly their MOAs, make use of them. With that in mind, it is likely we are standing in a robotics manufacturing room. And, unless I missed my guess,&quot; she turned, eyeing the inactive console near the belt, &quot;that console over there would handle whatever phase of construction this belt was responsible for.&quot; She looked back over the room, Scanning as the MOA&#39;s headlights floated across the walls. Unlike last time, however, she was looking for something specific. It was only Sonera&#39;s question, which didn&#39;t seemed to be addressed to anyone in particular, that snapped her from her focus as she looked to see what the Tenno was asking about.

&quot;Oh, no, no Sonera, I wouldn&#39;t recommend touching that. The machinery may not be online at the moment, but a soldering iron of that size could leave a sizeable burn if you aren&#39;t careful. For all we know, these machines could reactivate themselves at any time.&quot; Resuming her scans, she turned her attention to the higher corners of the walls that she could see, looking for one specific thing: security cameras.</span>

For a moment, Aurelia cursed her choice in Corpus proxy. An Osprey would have been easily able to get at the cameras. As she was, all she could do was stand on the ground and speculate. She had a theory. Clearly, something was amiss on this station, but so far they had come up with nothing as to what. Strangely, they hadn&#39;t seen any signs of a struggle, no bodies, no markings on the walls or ceiling that would indicate a firefight had taken place, and, going off of the analyses she had already done, no obviously harmful pathogens were in the air. <em>&#39;Nothing potent enough to harm a Tenno, at least.&#39;</em> She noted. Barring the frankly ludicrous idea of the living crewmembers vanishing in to thin air, there had to be at least some record of where they went and what happened to them, and if there were any area where there should be personnel stationed, it would be a production room such as this. Casting her gaze away from the cameras for a moment, she called to Svytoj as he made his way across the room.

&quot;Svytoj, would you mind keeping an eye out for anything resembling a security console? I have a theory I would like to test.&quot;</span>

But the main thing Svytoj noticed, was the suited body of a corpus crewman sitting in a fetal position tucked away in the corner of the room. It didn’t make a move.~</span>

A deep pout traveled across my fake expressive mouth piece as I was told that I can’t have the thing as a table or even touch it! “BAH!” I exclaim in a groaning manner, throwing my arms up like a frustrated monkey.

I look towards the Frost as he made his way towards the dark place of the room. “Uuuu” I hop up with glee, my previous frustration and pout thrown out as fast as yesterdays fish. I walk over towards him, to stand next to his right shoulder, my gaze dropping down to the cuddled Corpus.

“Uhhhhh”

I lift up my right foot to gently nudge the man with it, to see if he’s sleeping in that weird position or dead…or traumatized?! HEH HEH</span>

Having been absently keeping one eye on Svy&#39;s stream, his attention immediately caught on the curled up Corpus. He left his spot by the door and hurried over, nudging Sonera out of the way before growing still, his lights dimming.

&quot;Back up, back up!&quot; Kinsey grumbled, stepping forward out of their frame, and crouching by the Corpus. &quot;If the poor mucker&#39;s even alive, you really think they&#39;d wanna see a bunch of Warframes towering over &#39;em?&quot;

They reached out and shook the shoulder of the curled form, fully ready to defend themself just in case. &quot;Uh, hey bud...you alive?&quot;</span>

&quot;Will do.&quot; Svytoj said, His frost marching towards the back of the room.

Then he saw the Crewman slumped against the wall.
&quot;Whoa..&quot; He said, his tone low as Sonera bounced in. He watch the Wukong poke at the Corpus with their toe.
&quot;UM.. Perhaps we SHOULDN&#39;T be using our feet to do this? Perhaps?&quot; Svytoj said quite bluntly, before calling back over to Aurelia.
&quot;No console just yet; Just some crewman.&quot; He said. He pulled out a synth scanner; looking to for EMF from the suit, and heat, hopefully, from the body.</span>

She asked matter of factly taking a few steps back to not crowd the corner hearing lev&#39;s words from the doorway. She nodded to herself, yeah if any corpus suddenly woke up seeing three huge warframes standing around looking down at them, they&#39;d probably would freak out at the sight.</span>

Hearing the commotion occuring on the other side of the room, Aurelia followed Inari over to the other side of the room to see what all the fuss was about. Upon noticing the Crewman sitting there, she commanded the MOA to hurry its strides, only slowing to try and maneuver past the assembled Tenno. 

&quot;Quite right Svytoj, even if this Corpus regains consciousness, the sight of you three would likely send him into shock. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like a chance to examine them.&quot; Aurelia stepped closer to begin scanning the motionless Corpus, searching for any vital signs or barring that, any probably causes of death. Without looking up from her task, she called to Sonera.

&quot;Sonera, I realize this room may not be as exciting to you as the last one, but would you mind helping Svytoj look for a security console while I examine our friend here? I would very much appreciate it.&quot;</span>

Just a dead crewman. Nothing new there. Crewmen died easily. At least Grineer wore armor. Kamos let the others investigate the corpse and whatnot, while he stayed to the back of the group and kept an eye on things. Same way he and Atela operated. She would do the investigative work, he would stand guard. It always worked there. There <em>were</em> a lot of Tenno here, though. Eh, whatever. He&#39;d stick to his usual strategy. Then, he started hearing that growl.

He knew that even if the threat was unknown, it was still a threat. He poked Chegar in the shoulder to get his attention. Immediately, Kamos&#39; shotgun was raised and aiming down the dark hallway. Should he get the attention of the rest of the group? Might just be something in the station falling apart... If there was a threat that appeared, he would tell the group. Probably. Regardless, the shotgun stayed pointed down the hallway.</span>

As she feared, this Corpus was dead, and apparently had been for some time. As for what killed him, the suit concealed much. However, it also helped her eliminate some possibilities. From what she could tell, this Corpus hadn&#39;t been shot, and there were no signs of lacerations, burns or any other kinds of damage to the suit itself. That eliminated most, if not all Grineer weapons, any Corpus weapons that relied on projectiles or electricity, as well as most varieties of Warframe abilities or Tenno weapons that she knew of. That still left a few options, but they would have to get the suit off of him to confirm anything. finishing her scans, she turned to Kinsey, who was currently struggling to find any pockets on the suit itself. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure about pockets, but would you mind getting that helmet off of him first? That might be a good place to start.&quot;</span>

“Oh shit there they are,” they said, rummaging through the pockets. “Uhhhh we got...whatever this thing is, and uhhh...a grenade.”

Kinsey pulled out the two items they’d found and showed them to the MOA. “What the muck is this thing, anyway?” They asked, peering at the electric cigarette.

“Shit, right, the helmet. Just a sec.”
Kinsey put down their looted items and fumbled with the helmet in an attempt to remove it.</span>

&lt;Understood. I recommend going to reinforce the guard group. Take Sonera with you. She&#39;ll likely join as soon as a fight begins anyway. I won&#39;t be of much help, but Inari and I will join you after we&#39;re done here.&gt;

Good good! This one will be fun fun!</em>” I grin to myself and take a couple of paces backwards as I examine my new toy. I throw the axe head over my shoulder where my expertly trained and dexterous tail swishes it off the air, holding it by coiling around the non-sharp part of it.

I twirl the cigarette around my hands, like a cat with a fresh ball of yarn and look over my shoulder, to proudly declare my new founding to the crew guarding the door…but…they’re not there?

I tilt my head, in a confused way, and make my way towards it, popping my head to the hallway to see both the Rhino and the Vauban having readied weapons and walking towards the darkness

“Something fun?!”

I yell out and fully hop out in to the hallway, extending my right hand in front of me, brandishing the electric cigarette like a dagger.</span>

Truthfully, Aurelia had been hoping for a bit more conclusive signs from the head, though that was mainly for convenience. Under ordinary circumstances, she&#39;d have the body brought to her Orbiter where a full autopsy could be performed.  Given her current state, however, that would prove to be impossible. She hadn&#39;t brought this MOA here with this chain of events in  mind, the proxy was little more than a camera and speakers with legs. Curious as she was as to what killed this Corpus, there were bigger things to worry about here.  Bringing the MOA back up to a full standing position, Aurelia addressed Inari and Leveret. 

&quot;Well, I think we&#39;ve spent enough time with this corpse. Shall we move on? I won&#39;t be able to learn much more here.&quot; Aurelia turned back towards the entrance and started walking towards it, noting that the absence of the other members of the party. Pausing for a moment, she turned the MOA back towards the Mirage, twisting the hip joints of the proxy without moving its feet.

&quot;Besides, I doubt any of us want to be left behind in a place like this.&quot;</span>

Turning on the ball of her feet, the mirage followed closely behind the small MOA , picking up the fact that the hallway crew was very quiet, and Lev and her were left with the cephalon in the room, she moved her gauntlet quickly back to her quiver, drawing out an arrow and quietly readying herself, &#39;true but now i&#39;m wondering what happened to the guys at the door, did you get anything from the other cephalon?&#39;. She asked stepping close to the MOA slowly sticking her head around the opening to peer down the hallway for the others, she motioned behind her back signaling the Frost to join them by the door.</span>

I halt my progress as the scratching noise hit me. I lift my gaze towards the Vauban and the Rhino, a quizzical look on my flexible face. If it were just me I’d just blast inside the room waving the electric cigarette like the sharpest dagger out there but…<em>”No no…listen to what  they said! Teamwork first when with others! Yes yes!</em>” I smile and nod my head to myself, turning to softly speak towards the other two

“Tell tell, we charge in and see or…”

I trail off, letting them conclude on what I was going to say</span>

Leveret straightened and rolled his shoulders. “I’m sure they’ll be fine. They’ll contact us if they need backup. Let’s check around here and see if we can find anything else. I don’t think we’ll get anything else out of this poor bastard.” He gave the corpse a light prod with his toe.</span>

The Vauban looked over at Sonara, thinking over his options.
He nodded, then looked over to Kamos.
&quot;Here&#39;s a plan: you and I up front, Kamos takes up the rear, Svytoj guards the door. Good?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay at the front.&quot; Kamos grunted, activating Iron Skin as if to prove a point. The now-reinforced Rhino stepped in front of the door, lowering his shotgun slowly. He took a couple slow steps back from the door, basically staring it down at this point. Well, his plan would become clear as he crouched down a little bit, and prepared to charge right through that door.

&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot; Aurelia sighed, before redirecting her attention back to the room&#39;s walls.  She hadn&#39;t seen anything like that blood-like residue in this room, which made her question if there was indeed a link between this Corpus and whatever really happened to this station. Of course, there were no conventional wounds on the Corpus, nor were there any signs of a battle in this room that she could see. For all they knew, this Corpus may very well have just curled up in the corner they found him in and died. She began pacing around the room again, the searchlights of the MOA drifting across the walls and floors in an unfocused pattern. As far as she could determine, the lot of them were still completely in the dark as to what happened, even with the discovery of the body. The only possible leads they had were finding some intact security logs of the area, and whatever was lurking out in the hallway beyond. &#39;Speaking of which...&#39; she thought to herself, before sending another message off to Svytoj, quietly reveling in the convenience of having another Cephalon to work with.

&lt;Svytoj? Progress update? What did you find out there?&gt; With the message sent, she turned her attention back to the two Tenno that remained in the room.

&quot;Well, as long as we&#39;re still looking around this room, please keep an eye out for anything that might be a security console, won&#39;t you? As I said before I have an idea, but I&#39;ll need one of those consoles to try it.&quot;</span>

Turning her head back in from the doorway, the mirage nodded at the cephalon&#39;s request, twirling her arrow a few times in her gauntlet hand before placing it back into her quiver, however she kept the Cernos at hand ready, just in case. Walking back toward the corpse of the worker, she squatted down, taking a closer look for signs of blood lose or any physical injuries that may have caused it&#39;s death.

 &quot;What idea you got for the console?&quot; She asked the AI for some light conversation, the stillness in the room still wasn&#39;t giving her the best vibes, and some light conversation tended to help her think better.</span>

A wide grin spreads across my maw, superficial jaw clenching to simulate my rising joy. <em>”Yes yes! Fun fun!</em>” My grip around the electric cigarette tightens, my tail gripping the axe head tighter but keeping it low to the floor. I look towards the Vauban, nodding my head vigorously up and down, a notion that looks like it’s about to break my neck.

“Yes yes!”


I manage to squeal out, taking two steps to the left as I noticed the Rhino popping his Iron skin and preparing for a charge <em>”Ohhhhhhh This will be AWESOMEEEEEE!</em>” I yell inside my head and lift a hand to smack my forehead, activating my Defy.

&quot;Well, I had a thought: ordinarily I would attempt to autopsy that Corpus over there, but as you can see...&quot; She had the MOA raise one foot off the ground and wiggled the toes of the mechanical proxy before returning the foot to the ground. &quot;I&#39;m not currently equipped to do that right now.  However, Corpus tend to use copious amounts of surveillance technology on stations like this one, and there&#39;s a good chance at least one of them recorded what happened here. So, if  we can find one of those consoles, I may be able to find out what exactly happened here, and possibly what we are up against.&quot; Her explanation finished, Aurelia continued to wander around the far side of the room, looking for any elevated platforms or anywhere else a security terminal could be hiding.</span>

Well, no one stopped him. Taking a moment to aim himself toward the door, he took a deep breath as he got ready. Normally, he would do this without hesitation, but doors were always weird.

The middle section horrendously warped inwards against the Rhino’s powerful assault, exposing small cracks into the room from the sides of the entrance. Inside was only darkness. However, the door still held, but barely. One more charge seemed sufficient to properly do it in. 

Meanwhile, Aurelia couldn’t manage to find a security console anywhere. The cabling of the camera disappeared into a hole in the ceiling at its mount, most likely suggesting that it led outside the room.~</span>

Her efforts to find a potential access point seeming to be in vain, Aurelia turned back to Inari and Leveret, who were searching and room and keeping a more general watch respectively. &quot;It seems like there isn&#39;t anything of value in here after all.&quot; she sighed. &quot;Shall we move on? I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to test my little theory-&quot; All at once an eruption of metallic screeches filled the room, overwhelming Aurelia synthesized voice and utterly derailing her train of thought. She hadn&#39;t received a response from Svytoj yet, but that didn&#39;t really seem necessary at this point. 

&quot;I suppose we should put a pin in that theory for now. It sounds like the other group just might need our assistance.&quot; Aurelia directed the MOA back towards the entrance of the room, pausing just as she got to the doorway. 

&quot;Actually,&quot; she said, rather sheepishly, &quot;it is probably best if one of you takes point. Leveret, would you mind?&quot;</span>

I boomed out in a excited tone as the Rhino smashed against the door with a quite pleasing bang, the sound ricocheting around in to a most wonderful symphony. <em>”I like I like! Strong sound! Yes yes!</em>”

“Again again!”


I demand with glee, my tail starting to weave behind me like a cat ready to pounce, the axe head that is held at it’s tip being more of a flailing hazard. I bend my knees slightly, ready to pounce inside the room the moment the door is down</span>

&quot;Hope whatever&#39;s on the other side is worth it.&quot; Svytoj said, disabling his video feed.
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you get the other team up to speed? Maybe send the video to someone else?&quot;
Svytoj cocked his head slightly, before realizing who Chegar was talking about.

She jumped a little hearing the loud screeching of the metal doors, &quot;yeah we may wanna see what the others are up to currently&quot; she said with a little hesitation in her voice, knowing the two who&#39;d probably cause the most ruckus, the rhino, and wukong were over there.  Giving a small bow to Lev as he headed out the door she motioned with a grand sweep for the cephalon to fall in behind him so she could take up the rear guard. 

Standing at the doorway, she took once last sweep of the room, her vision resting once again on the corpse of the worker, something still didn&#39;t feel right about that corpse, or most of what was going on in the station, all she could do was hope that this whole rag-tag group of tenno and cephalons hadn&#39;t walked into something that would end up over their heads.</span>

Kamos grunted as he stood back to look at what his first charge had done. Okay, good. Good progress, at least. He glanced to Sonera and their excited encouragement. He nodded to the Wukong, as he stepped back to the other end of the hallway. With a deep breath, he crouched down again. He took out his Lex and held it in his off hand, as he lined up for the second charge. 3... 2... 1...

At the end of its slide it sounded like it slammed into the far wall, but it was hard to tell; The flying projectile was quickly consumed by the darkened interior of the revealed room. 

The entrance-way of the room yawned before the group. Glints of sharp, silver light reflected off long scratches etched into the floor by some three-nailed beast. The scuffs were spread out in a seemingly random pattern, save for one set that trailed up to another still Corpus corpse. The fallen crewman lay limp on the cold metal right in front of the door’s control panel. It was cradled on its side in a fetal position, like a child who’s long whimpering had turned to slumber.

Nothing in the gelatinous shadows moved.~</span>

“Ha-HAAAAAAA”

I holler and quickly hop inside as soon as I saw that the Rhino went through it and barge inside the dark room. I hop inside after him, stance wide and electric cigarette held outwards in my right hand, the blade facing down. Likewise, my axe-brandishing tail points to the left in a right angle, hovering there. But…as soon as I noticed that there is no imidiate danger, I relaxed my legs a bit.

“Huh”

I huffed through my nose

“Boring! It left it left! Where?”

I glance at the scratches from what little light there was <em>”Three fingers! What does what does?! Oooooo!</em>” I take notice of the control panel and the corpse, turning towards the entrance to face the approaching group, pointing with the electric cigarette towards the panel.

“Hey hey! Can you see with this? Go to cameras of this room? If there are!”

The Corpus took little attention from me…besides, he’s probably dead like the last one and there is a creature with sharp claws roaming around <em>”Fun fun!</em>”</span>

&quot;Someone else deal with the panel.&quot; Kamos said, surprisingly quietly. He merely shrugged in response to Leveret. Using his own Warframe&#39;s light source as well, Kamos kept his shotgun raised as he slowly advanced toward the darkened side of the room. That was where all of the dangerous things were, if there were any here. When he glanced at the claw marks, he seemed to tense up quite a bit. &quot;Looks like an animal did this...&quot; He was still quiet, but he sounded a fair bit more on-edge now.

As he advanced toward the darkened part of the room, it occured to him that this was no way to look for something like this. An animal would know how to hide, right? Maybe Sonera had the right idea... He stopped moving, taking one last glance around before taking a deep breath.

&quot;HEY! GET OUT HERE!&quot; Kamos roared at the top of his lungs. As one might expect, he was <em>very</em> loud. If he did that right... maybe someone would hear something running away or toward them.</span>

Stepping in behind aurelia and lev, she tilted her head seeing the  crunched and mashed metal door laying in a dented heap on the ground. &quot;Yeah nice job there big guy&quot;  she said, mirroring lev&#39;s compliment toward the giant rhino frame. Seeing as they were back in one group, and that most of them had already gone to work inspecting the room she stood by the wrecked frame of the entrance, keeping a single arrow knocked into her bow. 

&quot;HEY! GET OUT HERE!&quot; The words startled her coming from the giant frame, turning on instinct, Inari dropped to one knee bringing her bow up, drawing the string back as she aimed toward the rhino not knowing what, or who, he was trying to startle out of those dark shadows.</span>

Due to Svtoj&#39;s video feed, Aurelia was already aware of the basic state of the room, though the sheer noise caused by the door being torn off its hinges still startled her.  Entering the room, the combination of Svytoj&#39;s feed and what her MOA&#39;s sensors were showing her immediately put her on edge. Something was absolutely wrong here. As the others seemed to be squaring up for a fight with whatever may have been lurking in the room, Aurelia moved over to Svytoj and the slumped over crewman.  

&quot;Just like the the other one...&quot; she noted aloud, before starting scans. &quot;Syvtoj?&quot; Aurelia asked.  &quot;Would you mind removing this crewman&#39;s helmet?&quot;</span>

Kamos’s shouted bounced off the ferrite walls and lapsed into the empty air. Nothing stirred in his vision, but he and the others were greeted with another concerning sight. Four dead crewman corpses littered the edges of the room. Each one was set around even more scratches and scrapes in the floor.

In the middle of the room a couple monitors and various scientific equipment had been deployed. Their lights were dim, even in the darkness, but they still seemed operational enough.~</span>

He looked around after shouting, failing to find anything. He put the shotgun away, immediately replacing it with his Gram. Close quarters, a sword would be better. Hmmmm... He didn&#39;t pay much attention to the bodies, but he could tell that was either an animal or a manic. Considering he heard growling, though... It <em>could</em> still be a manic, but he&#39;d have to stab whatever was here either way. He took another breath in, holding his greatsword in one of his hands.

&quot;<em><strong>COME ON OUT! SHOW YOURSELF!</strong></em>&quot; He shouted, angrier and louder than before. &quot;<em><strong>NOW!</strong></em>&quot;</span>

I visually hop up at the unexpected shout from the Rhino, my legs instinctively crouching down in to a fighting stance, my head swishing left and right to spot the danger that got my comrade so shouty. However, after realizing his intention I cracked a devilish smirk, metallic lips pulling back to reveal rows of sharp teeth.

“Yes yes! Come!”

I holler after the Rhino’s second more powerful call, waving my electric cigarette in my right hand like a angry latino mother holding a slipper and waiting for the child to come for a ass whopping. But, finding none of the patience for the said “child” to come hunkering towards me, I leap towards the darkness and the newly appeared bodies. In one smooth jump I land on top of the middle table, my posture low and crouched on top of it, my right arm extended in front of me in a defense like stance. I carefully gaze towards the darkness, lips smiling

“You think it’s here? Still? Or…”

I glance at the sides but unable to determine if the room does have a vent system in place through the darkness

“…lurking?”

The last word I say out in a more hyper way than usual, finding excitement in the thought that whatever creature caused this might be watching us.</span>

Svytoj didn&#39;t seem to be paying attention to what Aurelia had been saying, but from what she could tell without removing the helmet at least is that this crewman was almost a perfect match for the one they found in the last room: no obvious injuries, no noticeable tears in the suit, which seemed especially odd given the sets of claw marks all over the floor. Kamos&#39; shouting had broken her focus for a moment, causing her to whip the MOA around to glare (or at least the closest thing to glare that a MOA was capable of) at the irritatingly loud, bloodthirsty Tenno. She might have even said something to him, but her attention was immediately  grabbed by the four other bodies slumped around them. She took off at a trot towards the closest body, immediately starting another scan as soon as she was in range. She was looking for any possible sign indicating a cause of death, though she wasn&#39;t expecting anything too obvious.</span>

It took a moment for what Aurelia said to finally reach him; stuck in his own cost/benefit analysis.
The frost loomed over the body, before finally relenting. The frost delicately disconnected the Crewman&#39;s helmet from it&#39;s suit.
As for Chegar, he began to swab the claw marks, hoping to find some residue or trace evidence of what had made them.</span>

Seeing no immediate action within the room, the mirage lowered her bow staying slightly behind the other frost to keep a watch from the outside. Having everyone in such close quarters with possible hostiles, didn&#39;t seem like the smartest thing to happen, looking down at the MOA that held the cephalons mind she gave it a small tap trying to get Aurelia&#39;s attention, &quot;anything in there interesting?&quot; she asked to hopefully at least get an idea of what the situation was on the inside of the room.</span>

Sonera found hundreds of dark-tinted glass shards scattered across the floor ahead. They sat on top of a conjoined mess of three-laned scratches all across the worn ferrite. Massive monitors dominated the wall space sporting gaping holes in its structure, their contents on the floor as previously mentioned. On the far wall, metal bulkheads sheathed large windows stretching the width of the room. The protective barriers also displayed their fair share of scrapes.

Other than that, the room was empty.

Sonera caught sight of a couple vents along standard places in the ceiling, but nothing out of the ordinary. They were all closed and softly breathing fresh air into the laboratory. Aurelia scans found, perhaps frustratingly at this point, nothing irregular on the outside of each downed crewmen. Chegar’s hand came away with nothing but a bunch of ferrite dust.

Svytoj, on the other hand, saw something different. The visor and mouth guard of the helmet he just removed came away caked in dried blood. The all-natural paint was also featured all around the mouth and neck of the 43 year-old crewman it had been taken from. The pale crewman&#39;s soulless eyes stared the frost down, as if they were requesting the reason behind the disturbance of his slumber.~</span>

I hummed under my breath as the vents were truly intact…or looked like at least! This darkness is bothersome! <em>”But! Makes it more fun no? Yes yes! A challenge!</em>” I smile to myself and hop down from whatever I was standing on, advancing further in the room. My steps are light and carefully placed but the frame they carry is not so and a inevitable crack is heard as I place my left foot on top of a glass shard. I freeze and lift my foot, bringing it down on the next shard for another soft crack.

I smile, the wave like joyful energy that constantly grips me travels once more, from the tip of my toes, up my spine and pooling around my mind. <em>”Fun fun!</em>” I start cracking the glass shards as I make my way through them, each step a choreographed dance routine with twirls and hops, my hands twirling above me, the electric cigarette that I wielded as a dagger before is now held as a glow stick. Cracks fill the air as I preform above the shards, enjoying the accompanying noise…like creating a symphony with movement!

“Hey hey!”

I boom out mid soutenu

“Look look! Is this a cage?”

I end the soutenu with a backwards arch, the electric cigarette being held out to point towards the monitors, that smile never wavering.</span>

Still peering in from his position guarding the doorway, Leveret&#39;s headlamp helped illuminate the corpse as it was unmasked.

&quot;Looks like they were coughing up blood,&quot; he offered. &quot;I don&#39;t know much about investigating but I&#39;ve seen that before, I think. Could be wrong, though, Svy&#39;s closer.&quot;

None of his other ideas seemed useful enough to say aloud, so he settled on continuing to be a light source for the rest of the group.</span>

&quot;Hold on Sonera, let me take a look.&quot; Walking at a brisk pace, the MOA went towards the center of the room, examining the platform amongst all the shattered glass. Looking over it, she could recognize  what she was looking at to a limited extent.  &quot;Hm,&quot; she muttered aloud. &quot;Obviously a examination area. Perhaps there&#39;s a functional terminal nearby?&quot; She started carefully examining the area around the center of the room, looking for any technology that still be in one piece.</span>

Nothing... nothing showed up to fight. He was disappointed, honestly. He could try shouting a third time, but... Say what you will about him, he was smart enough to at least know when there was nothing to fight immediately. He didn&#39;t put the gun down, but he looked a tad disappointed. Dejected, even. He had come here for a fight, for something to do. He stood there in silence, holding his shotgun in a distinctly non-threatening way, watching all of these other Tenno accomplish something.</span>

The frost shook his head with a sigh.
“Sorry, buddy. Has to be done.”  He said, beginning to examine the caked blood.
“You, Cheg, You got a surgical kit on hand?” He called out, with Chegar running up to see what the fuss was.
“Jesus... yeah, I think so...poor guy.”
“Yep; I need to see what exactly happens to him, so things might get a bit gory.”
“Roger that.” Chegar replied, handing off a small case of tools.
With that, Svytoj began carefully dissecting the Crewman’s suit, studying the mans body for signs of trauma; animal attack, GSW, bends, anything.</span>

Now closer to the monitors, Sonera could make out scratches on the inside of its frame where the glass would normally obscured it. Now that the glass was on the floor, however, they glistened slightly in the dim conditions.

Svytoj, cutting open the suit, exposed ghastly pale flesh with small dried blood splotches in seemingly random places along the front of the torso. Nothing on the outside of the crewman’s body was damaged in any way, and the inside of his suit was the same. It was a perplexing sight.

Kamos felt a slight discomfort in his stomach as he silently stood in the middle of the room…~</span>

Was it something he ate? Was it a lack of food? Why would be affecting him in Transference? Maybe feedback? Honestly, he struggled to differentiate between being hungry, and having a gut feeling that something might happen. He glanced directly down before checking his surroundings, raising up his shotgun again, just in case this was some sort of gut feeling. Was this gonna be one of those things were a parasite jumped out of him? Well, he&#39;d find out. He didn&#39;t say anything yet, not wanting to come across as too paranoid or possibly just being an idiot.</span>

Seeing the too-pale body of the crewman reminded him of something he didn&#39;t want to think about - especially with Svytoj starting to cut into the poor bastard - so Leveret forced his attention elsewhere.

He scanned the area again, looking around at the mess of the room. He found himself wishing something would just up and attack already. The tension of the situation was starting to weigh on him. Needless to say, this wasn&#39;t what he expected when he applied for all this.

&quot;Kamos, you good there? Just spacing out or what?&quot; he called, noticing the Rhino was basically just standing still in the middle of the room.</span>

Svytoj whistled, Taking one of the scalpels, and scraping off some of the dried blood.
&quot;Now that... that is a bit confusing.&quot; Chegar said, looking over the frost&#39;s shoulder. Svytoj, however, was deathly quiet at this point.
&quot;Okay...&quot; Svytoj said, taking an empty vial from the kit, placing the dried blood inside, and sealing it. with that, he sterilized his tools, and placed all but the blood vial back in the kit.
&quot;They said this was a re-creation of... whatever BS RU has on record. If that&#39;s the case, I REALLY hope this isn&#39;t hemorrhagic fever of some kind.&quot; He continued, studying the blood sample with his synth-scanner. &quot;Or a parasitoid mold culture. and I hope to God this isn&#39;t someone&#39;s eldritch pet someone let loose here...&quot; Svytoj gave a disgruntled, slightly nervous sigh.
&quot;You know, I remember when it was only Void exposure that was the issue. Ya&#39;ll remember that?&quot; he said looking back at the various occupants of the room. &quot;Those were good times.&quot; He finished, returning to his scan, popping his neck in the prosses.

In spite of all the damage to the equipment, Aurelia found that the terminals in this room miraculously still functioned. While her choice of proxy did not have the equipment for a proper autopsy, it did have the equipment to interface with terminals such as this one. She attempted to access the terminal, wirelessly first if at all possible, trying to keep her platform mobile in the event she needed to escape quickly. Whatever killed those guards and made those marks in the floor may not have been there at the moment as far as she could tell, but there was no telling if would return or not. Even with the multiple Tenno in the room, Aurelia knew it would likely only take one solid hit from a beast with the apparent capability to cut into metal to destroy her proxy, which was the one scenario she just couldn&#39;t permit. Shaking the unpleasant thought from her mind, she redoubled her efforts into getting into the terminal, whilst keeping a lesser amount of attention on the feed still coming from Svytoj.</span>

Aurelia cabled into the terminal and initiated its boot sequence. Half-way through its POST, the monitor blinked from orange to a glaring red. Three high-pitched beeps sounded in succession, repeating every couple seconds. The MOA wouldn’t have time to think about that, however.

Because the horrible cacophony of grinding metal captured her attention.

<em>SCRRRK</em>. Kamos witnessed three small dots carve themselves into the floor just ahead of them, seemingly out of thin air. Before he had a chance to react, some kind of invisible claw rapidly sped towards him, driving another long groove into the ferrite floor on approach!

<em>SCRAAAAAAAAPE</em>. Everyone had milliseconds to react.~</span>

Kamos, possibly unlike everyone else, was really prepared for this. Sparring with Atela had taught him something about invisible foes. Probably. At least, he had muscle memory. That was good enough, right? Seeing the scratches in the floor, the Rhino immediately thrust a knee forward to knock whatever that thing was out of the air. Too close for a kick, but too far for an elbow.  If his knee made contact with anything, that would be followed up by a near-instant reflexive blast from his shotgun, pointed somewhere in front of him.</span>

There was a brief feeling of relief as Aurelia managed to gain access to one of the terminals. It was damaged, and needed to be booted up again, but otherwise it seemed fine. She could only hope that no valuable data had been lost or corrupted by whatever attacked this room. Midway through the boot sequence, the monitor blazed to life, with orange and then red light bathing the MOA as it stood in front of the screen. That alone was enough to startle her, but that was nothing compared to what came next. The transition of relative silence to high pitched, metallic screeching that seemed to come from nowhere was like something from her own nightmares. Panicking, she disconnected from the terminal and frenetically looked around the room while simultaneously striding backward, flickering through every kind of sensor the MOA had in a quite possibly futile attempt to locate the source of the noise, increasing dread setting in as each setting yielded nothing.</span>

Ooh, that stung a bit. A lot, actually. That <em>really</em> hurt. How had he missed? This stupid invisible animal... Probably like a kubrow. And this thing <em>hurt</em> him? Seriously? No, not that much. He wasn&#39;t gonna let it win. Not something so... small, relative to him. To be honest, this angered him. No, that was an understatement. He was enraged. <em>Furious</em>. He wouldn&#39;t let anything get away with that. Dropping his shotgun on the floor, Kamos held a hand over the wound. After taking a single breath, he stepped forward... and let out a roar far louder than any noise he had made so far. Before, he was just angry. Now, he was far, far beyond that. Mid-roar, he brought his foot down on the ground, likely denting and messing up the floor below him as he stomped as hard as he could. Maybe anger wasn&#39;t always equivlant to power or combat prowess, but it helped.</span>

Taking advantage of the stomp, Leveret shot a hand forward and the temperature in the room dropped. Icicles formed on the walls and ceiling and, should his plan work, the invisible creature would also be slowed by the cold.</span>

Icicles burst from the walls, flinging even more scraps of material into the already polluted air. Glimmering crystals stuck to every crevice of the machines, their damage remained unassessed for the moment.

The Tenno only bought a couple of seconds to orientate themselves before two more invisible claws scraped across the floor, ignoring the Rhino’s normally hazardous field of nullified gravity and smashing through the Frost&#39;s ice and slush.

As what sounded like two additional assailants entered the room, Aurelia began to realize something: whatever these things were, they seemed to be ignoring her. It wasn&#39;t much, but she might be able to capitalize on this. turning her attention back to the terminal she had been trying to access earlier, she attempted to regain access to the terminal, praying that there may be something there that could help against these invisible foes.</span>

Great, now his stomp was useless. Looks like he would have to deal with them in the only other way he really could. He took notice of the one closing in on Leveret, mostly because of all of that ice. Doing his absolute best to ignore the searing pain from his wound, Kamos managed to take out his greatsword. Okay, he can do this... <em>It&#39;s just a flesh wound...</em> Lunging forward, Kamos brought the sword down right on where the... thing, had broken through the ice. Mid-swing, though, he stumbled quite a bit. Not from the ice, though. Okay, maybe the injury was worse than he thought. He ended up needing to prop himself up with his sword as it impacted into whatever may or may not be in the spot he attacked, clutching the wound with his other hand.</span>

<em>”Wha-</em>” While confused - possibly cause my attention was mainly grasped by the Rhino to notice anything else going on around me - I didn’t question the familiar commanding order that boomed through my ears and did as he told. I make a swift roll to the left, dodging whoever those claws belonged to. I remained in a crouched position at the end of the roll, smirking. 

“Ahhh! Silly one! Yes yes! Come on then!”

I yell out at the invisible foe and stand up, spreading my arms apart in a challenging manner. The axe head being held by my tail has dropped low to the ground while the electric cigarette is being held in my palm only by my thumb</span>

How could his ice not have done anything? And Kamos&#39; stomp as well? Were it not for the scape of claws, he&#39;d think there was nothing in the room!

Hearing the scraping of claws near him, Leveret instinctively brought up his shield to defend himself, blocking his chest and neck with the thick grineer shield. He was glad to see Kamos come to assist with a swing of his sword, but Leveret&#39;s concern grew exponentially as the Rhino stumbled and clutched his chest. <em>Muck muck muck muck muck...</em>

&quot;You&#39;re not looking too good, buddy!&quot; he commented, the concern very audible in his voice.</span>

Kamos felt himself once again merely passing through air on his way down to the floor. The marks zoomed towards Leveret and stopped a single centimeter away from his shield. For a couple of seconds, hope seemed to rest in his sturdy brunt.

Then all at once, Leveret’s lungs were torn into as well.

Honestly, Kamos was kind of dazed and confused at this point. Dazed, confused, and full of adrenaline. Too dazed to notice the... thing, jumping and attacking Lev. Still propping himself up with his greatsword, all he saw were the scratches on the ground near Sonera. Without even pausing for a much-needed breath (<s>Not that he could with his lungs punctured</s>), Kamos used a Charge to propel himself in the direction of the thing going after the Wukong. He swung mid-charge, on the off chance that he hit something. Unfortunately, this had been a poorly-judged move, and he would slam into a wall a moment later.</span>

I keep my arms wide open, not even making a run for it like the last time.

Finally managing to connect to the terminal&#39;s OS, Aurelia quickly tried to go through whatever files were readily available. There were two directories available to her, but one was regrettably locked behind a password that didn&#39;t have time to try and crack. That left her with the second directory, and the handful of files contained within. Not having much time, she only opened one file, titled EXP-0101. Simulataneously, she responded to Inari&#39;s question.

&quot;Not at the moment! Whatever it is that&#39;s attacking us, it seems to be ignoring me, so please make sure it stays that way!&quot; As best she could, she used whatever resources she had available to scan around her, checking to make sure this monster wasn&#39;t heading her way.</span>

You couldn’t blame him, with the amount of blood he had lost. Transference wasn’t so safe that it made you immune from experiencing physical pain, or mental backlash. The Rhino slammed into the monitor casings on the wall with a <em>CLANG</em>.

Sonera hugged the wind.

...and then her lungs fell victim to internal puncturing. 

Not giving the beaten Tenno a single microsecond to inhale a diaphragm full of oxygen, more scratches re-appeared in the middle of the room. The new set tore through the ferrite floor towards Svytoj standing at the entrance, whether it was a result of the noise he made or not.~</span>

“Huh?” Surprise hit me as I grabbed on to air, but it didn’t hit me as hard as the puncture that I felt go through my chest making me let out a gasp. My free hand shoots up to grab on to the punctured spot and I drop down on one knee, feeling searing pain spreading through my lungs. My lungs. MY lungs. No…not mine…his…not mine…his lungs.

My face wrinkled up with a grin and a ironic laugh wheezes out at the satiation, the damage not sufficient enough to proc my Defy and rid me of this nuisance, of HIS suffering. <em>”No no…it must stop, must be fit for fight!</em>” There was a thought but…no execution of it with my current arsenal consisting of a electric cigarette, a flimsy improvised axe-head and some bits and pieces of metal debris. So…none of that. I take notice of where the Rhino made his spectacular crash and stiffen a laugh. “<em>No time no time…must move NOW</em>”

Getting up on my feet I wobble my way towards him, each step as agonizing as the one before, ooze pooling inside my chest cavity. I crouch down beside him “Up up…common…move move!” I boom at him and reach down to try and assist him in getting up by pulling on his arm since it looks like we’re evacuating the room.</span>

The wall dented by his poorly-aimed charge, Kamos didn&#39;t even stumble as he collapsed to the ground.  The greatsword clattered against the floor a moment later, as what little grip he had on it was gone. Come on, get up.... He could only cough and clutch at his chest, trying and failing to take a breath. Why the lungs, of all things? It was effective, but... Ouch. He could only lay there as the situation got worse and worse, and the pain grew with every attempt at a breath.

He had to do something. Anything. <em>Anything</em>. He couldn&#39;t just lay here and be useless. But what could he do? The Rhino grunted, trying and failing to reach for his sword, as his shaky hand fell onto the ground with a soft thud. Well, that didn&#39;t work... Really, that left him with one option. By far the worst one, to him. The next reflexive attempt at a breath bringing on a surge of pain, the desperate Kamos saw nothing else he could do. With a sigh, the frame went limp, and the silhouette of an Operator appeared next to it...</span>

Another gurgling cough. <em>Muck, this is bad.</em>
&quot;Kamos, bud, can you hear me still? Hang in there.&quot;

Still physically safe in the transference pod, Kinsey furiously attempted to mute the damage warnings popping up in their HUD. &quot;VILKAS, MUTE THE MUCKING ALERTS, I CAN FEEL IT DAMN WELL FINE WITHOUT THEM!&quot; they yelled. Some warnings remained but it was noticeably easier to focus now.

At a loss for what else to do, Leveret could only stand over Kamos protectively and hope for someone to figure out what to do.</span>

However, Chegar still remained as his Vauban took a knee, and Chegar&#39;s humanoid for burst from the suit in a dim flash of light. He leveled his amp where he felt the claws should be, and fired, sending streaks of Green void energy across the room.
With that, Svytoj felt the frost go heavy; the lights diming on the warframe with Chegar no longer in his transference chamber.

If there was anything on this terminal that could help them bring this thing down, she needed to find it fast. If this thing was making short work of Tenno, she wouldn&#39;t last a mere fraction of a second against it. Unfortunately, what she had found in the terminal so far was less than helpful. The file folder she managed to open had little more some uselessly vague lab report, along with what she could only assume was a binary compilation file.

The program in question seemed to reside on the current terminal she was interfacing, and used a peripheral connection out the back end of the computer. A quick glance told the cephalon that the only medium it could’ve used was a cable that ran all the way to the mysterious chamber-like device in the center of the room. 

The claws chasing down Svytoj were successfully fooled by the warframe’s quick movements. The scraping halted near the front of the door, and to those paying close attention, suddenly nicked the upper crossbeam of the doorframe. Streams of energy billowing from Chegar’s amp passed through the air without notice of hitting a thing.

And then the invisible mandibles ran again. This time however, they started from the top of the wall Inari stood by and rushed downwards to her.~</span>

Watching the claws moving toward her direction, the mirage poured her void energy into making her duplicates again, seeing how some of the others were getting beaten badly, and both the wukong and Rhino were hit in critical areas, she wasn&#39;t one to allow herself such damage as well. Three mirages walked out from her own frame, each with their Cernos bows knocked and aiming at the invisible foe that was making a dash at them. 

Hearing the cephalons response, she fired off two arrows in quick succession and started running toward the other side of the room, trying to keep whatever was attacking the group away from the cephalons not so reinforced MOA.</span>

Shaking for a moment, the Operator kneeled beside the abandoned Rhino. He was free of the injury now, but the pain was still there... And yep, it still hurt. The Operator coughed with significantly less gurgling of blood, as he struggled to get to his feet. He stood there, at his full... rather diminutive height. Maybe a meter and a half, at most. He clenched his fists, and... Okay, there was definitely something wrong with his right hand. The hand and much of the forearm was scorched and burned, and almost looked charred. Regardless, fists were clenched as Kamos glanced around the room.

He had already tuned everyone else out, including Lev. Not noticing Chegar&#39;s failure to damage anything, Kamos took notice of the scraping approaching Inari. Raising his left hand and a rather patched-together amp, the Operator opened fire on the wall with a blast of void energy. Here&#39;s hoping he could finally hit something, right?</span>

Well…looks like the Rhino is…I pause as I sensed the frame went limp and his operator dash out in a flash of light. Despite the impeccable pain spreading through my chest I manage a fanged smile, finding the stark contrast of the bulky and marauding Rhino to be operated by a small boy. <em>”Ah! Small small! Like me! YES YES! Maybe a worthy dance partner?! BAH! FOCUS FOCUS!</em>”

I give my head a shake, getting rid of these thoughts for the moment and take notice of the disregarded greatsword that belonged to the Rhino. A new joy sparked within me and I bent down to grab on to the blade, lifting it up and gently pressing the tip against my chest. With a soft giggle, I do a small hop in the air to push the greatsowrd in to a straight vertical point before I drop down on it with my entire body weight, the greatsword puncturing my chest with a stiff slash. A loud POP is heard after it, followed by my laughter as I pull the sword from my chest, the wound and the internal punctures all gone.

“Yes yes!”

I stand still in front of the limp Rhino and the Frost, holding the greatsword in my right hand, keeping a eye at the claws in case they turn and head towards the offed-boys behind me.</span>

The sudden stop of the claws struck Svytoj as bizarre. he took out his scanner again: perhaps the interference and the claws had some connection?
As for  Chegar, the lack of contact with the entity didn&#39;t sit well.  Still trying to process what was happening, Aurelia&#39;s words hit his ears. He looked over at the Wukong now raising their sword.
<em>Okay...eyes open. Eyes open.</em> Chegar thought,  backing himself against his now limp Vauban.</span>

They plowed through the cold ferrite straight and struck… one of Inari’s mirage apparitions. The scraping halted right after passing through it without a single effect.

Svytoj’s scanner couldn’t find anything to scan, but the cephalon did happen to notice something. If he plotted a path between the end of the trail on the floor and the beginning and endpoints of the trail on the door frame, they formed a perfect arch.

Two more tracks came into sight targeting both the real Inari, and one of her other apparitions.~</span>

Nothing was working. Why was nothing working? Something had to work! It had to. Kamos was growing increasingly frustrated and angry. This wasn&#39;t fair. He glanced back for a moment, watching Sonera stab herself with his greatsword. Weird, but... Well, whatever. Kamos turned his attention back to the claws scraping along the walls, growing frustrated once again. Between that, and Lev&#39;s sorta-rant...

Kamos roared again. But... Well, he didn&#39;t exactly have the benefit of his Frame or any voice modifications right now. It was already much higher-pitched immediately, but his voice cracking a moment later didn&#39;t help. He ran forward in the general direction of Inari, firing another blast from the amp toward one of the tracks.</span>

Svytoj  kept his scanner trained on the room, still looking for the interference that he had first seen. As he looked, he extended his hand towards the invisible arc, dipping his fingers an inch into its apex. As for Chegar, all he could think to do was continue to scan the area. He looked back at his limp warframe, then back into the room. Finally, the Tenno slipped back into transference, raising his shotgun in an almost futile defiance of whatever was in there.</span>

Good good, looks like the claws have no through for the two pierced lads behind me, it only goes for those untouched by the claws. My gaze flinches towards human Kamos as he lets out his adorable roar and starts dashing like a madman at the claws…even if all previous attacks of that sort did nothing. No power reaches them, and they seem to not be attached to a animal at all, even if invisible you’d think you could grasp such creature but NOPE, my attempt to grab it failed as well so it’s invisible AND untouchable? Or…controlled by a outer source?

Then a thought hit me as I caught one of the claws heading towards the other Mirage clones. I quickly plop out of my frame and void dash in a straight line to be in front of the claws, leaving a blazing trail of emerald fire behind me. Smirking, I’ll remain in void mode till the claws reach me or the clone and then just before they scrape either I’ll swiftly pop out of void mode to preform Void Radiance, a blinding flash of light hoping it would stun it or…well…anything really.</span>

Just when it was about to hit her it… didn’t. They passed right through the void-bound Tenno and the illusion behind her. The second set of claws drove forward, however. Inari manage to dodge it by a hair’s breadth, hearing a soft ringing sound as it flew by her head. The enemy continued to run through another illusion behind her and stopped for a couple seconds, then changed course and flew towards Inari once again.

Kamos’s amp blast once again saw no effect on the pursuer, but it did succeed in broadsiding whatever machine sat in the middle of the room. The sound of crackling static filled the air, and Aurelia’s connection to the terminal took a massive interference spike which gave the cephalon a good spook.

It was still impossible to see anything through Svytoj’s scanner. The entire HUD was horribly distorted by some sort of interference which also sent rippling waves of dizzying pixels across the viewport.~</span>

The heroic scream from Kamos snapped my attention to the furious boy…just in time to see a beam of void energy heading towards me.

Just before it could zap me I quickly obey the commanding voice and transfer back to my frame with a dull flash of green. Now, back to my Wukong, my hands quickly shoot up to touch my chest and head “Oh…not zapped…PHEW!” I chuckle to myself and look back at Kamos <em>“Us more than them!”</em> My hands unclasp, dropping the electric cigarette and greatsword to clatter on the floor.

In three quick dashes I close the distance to Kamos and aim to preform a tight locking-hug from behind, his arms tucking to his sides under my embrace as well so he couldn’t use them to frail. With this I will straighten up and lift him up from the ground, hopefully stopping his mad zapping.

One of Kamos&#39;s  void blasts  hits the back of one of her shoulder pauldrons sending her frame into a roll  across the floor, kicking her feet down feeling her heels digging into the metalic floor, the mirage bounced back up returning onto her course for the center of the room seeing and  hearing the static fill the room from the angered tenno&#39;s shots that hit the device, &#39;can someone please hold him down for mother&#39;s sake!&#39; she screamed out,  to the others, catching a glimpse of the wukong heading over to restrain him.

Tapping into the team comms she reached out to the MOA cephalon, &#39;so what&#39;s the plan here, and is whatever in the middle still operational?&#39; she asked quickly as she tried to stay a constant moving target as to not be easy pray for the invisible claws.</span>

Alright, she had had quite enough of all of this. The massive spike of interference would have made her jump if she wasn&#39;t already standing on eggshells. Fortunately, the machine still appeared to function. That said, Aurelia still wasn&#39;t convinced this was even going to work, and whatever confidence she had was eroding by the second. At that moment, Inari&#39;s voice cut through the mayhem around them.

&quot;I believe,&quot; she began in an exasperated tone &quot;That this device is some kind of containment field, possibly meant for whatever is attacking us. If we can just contain a portion of this creature, we might stand a chance against it. Although, I am having my doubts that we are capable of killing this monstrosity, even if containment is possible.&quot; There was a great degree of worry as she spoke, hinting at the horror that lurked beneath.  &quot;The device seems damaged, but it should still function.&quot;</span>

&quot;Sonera dammit! Let the mucker go!&quot; he gasped, the edges of his vision going dark, &quot;One of you help me get- ghh... - get Kamos&#39; frame out of here.&quot;

He stumbled over to the collapsed Rhino and started to try and drag the empty warframe towards the door. Ooh, whatever wounds he had <em>really</em> didn&#39;t like that.

&quot;Also, I think it might fall for illusions-&quot;
His sentence was interrupted by a particularly violent, wet cough, and a dully glowing red-orange fluid dribbled from the front of his helmet. &quot;So it can probably see. We should try and blind it, I think. Inari?&quot;</span>

His angry screeches continued, as he tried and failed to squirm out of the Wukong&#39;s hold. Why was Sonera stopping him, when there were things to be killed? Why was everyone wasting time? He attempted to fire another void blast, but found himself unable to focus enough to do so. Of course, the Operator was far less strong than the frame, so Kamos was sort of stuck here. Heck, he didn&#39;t even notice the claws bound for him again.

&quot;Let me go!&quot; Kamos demanded, voice starting to crack more and more as he shouted. He was probably gonna have a bit of a sore throat later. And, while he refused to let himself acknowledge it, he was really starting to get a bit exhausted. Stupid, weak Operator body.</span>

No matter how much he struggles, I keep him firmly in my embrace, sure he was trying to shoot the enemy but he was also shooting allies <em>”No no, can’t have that , no no</em>”

I take notice of the claws heading towards me and Kamos and I swiftly leap backwards. Svytoj’s words trapped my attention and I boom out to him through the coms “No clue no clue, claws, can’t touch, can’t stop, no power reaches it – WHOA” I duck as whatever dislodged from the machine flew near me.

“Controlled from outer source or not real” I finish my sentence as I flop Kamos over my right shoulder and dash towards Leveret to help him haul the bulky Rhino out with my other free hand...hoping the claws don&#39;t make a U turn for us</span>

Sliding to a stop on the floor she picked up on Lev&#39;s comms to her about his idea of trying a blinding tactic, hell at this point in time with a few frames already badly injured they had to do something to get the upper hand on their foe. Bending down the mirage clasped her hands together once more, this time pushing more energy from the void into the small crystal forming between her palms, &#39;this better bloody work&#39; she mumbled to herself, the energy burned into the crystal turning the prisms of milky white into a light blue as she burned the idea of a giant flash into the multiple facets. 

Feeling the energy crackling against her frames fingertips, Inari stood up spreading her hands releasing the crystal of void energy into the air, &#39;everyone cover your eyes NOW!&#39; she screamed reaching out with her right hand, the tenno focused on the crystal and cracking it, gripping her right hand closed the energy violently discharged casting the entire room in a brilliant white light.</span>

In the band of Tenno, The unfortunate ones who closed their eyes saw the blinding flash stick to the inside of their eyelids, a penalty for being so near. A big, amalgamous blue glow had been annoyingly fixed into their eye sockets and a tingle crept up the back of their skull. At least, that’s probably what they surmised at first. 

But it didn’t go away.

What’s more, it seemed to move around their view to stay in some three dimensional space in front of them. If one turned their head away from the center of the room, it vanished.

The Operator flinched at the flash of light, eyes closed as his head turned away. Okay, this made things even worse. This thing was... Well, he thought it was invisible when it first attacked, but he couldn&#39;t hit it. And it had beaten him. None of this made sense! Seeing as he was over Sonera&#39;s shoulder, he was able to move his limbs. Take a wild guess at what he did. He fired off a few more blasts of void energy, even worse aim this time.

It only took... maybe two blasts in quick succession, before he stopped again. Why did he stop? Well, seeing as his whole body sorta went limp, it was clear he was either exhausted or he had just passed out. Seeing as he had finally stopped screaming, maybe the latter.

You know…I never expected for a Mirage to have such blinding capabilities. I mean sure, a disco ball is sparkly and all but on this scale?! I instictivly close my eyes as the call to do so ringed out seconds before the actual whiteness. Despite the horrible head-banging brightness that latched on to my eyes I continued my trajectory towards the door (or hoping at least cause can’t be too sure with the distorting light), dragging the Rhino by the wrist, hoping the Frost did so too or else I’ll have to drag him too!

My other hand rested on Kamos’ lower back, to firmly keep him on top my shoulder as I make my sluggy retreat. <em>”Back back, get them to safety, then back in to the fray! Yes yes!</em>”</span>

Although he shielded his eyes from Inari&#39;s blinding light - it was his idea to make it that bright, after all - Leveret still found himself staring at the impression of a shape. Something wrong with his optics? No time for diagnostics...his other wounds would likely override it anyway.

Stumbling over to Sonera, Leveret held out an arm. &quot;Give him here, his frame&#39;s too...too heavy for me...but I can take...the kiddo.&quot; he gasped. He was already forming a plan. It was a favorite strategy, no less. <em>I&#39;ll guard Kamos with my frame and go muck things up by hand, I suppose...</em></span>

Though a substantial part of her attention had been dedicated to the console&#39;s interface, the blinding flash temporarily rendered the MOA&#39;s visual sensors useless, though the light had little adverse effect on the Cephalon herself. While the machine itself may have been broken, Aurelia went back into the console to find another file, all the while desperately trying to bring the visual sensors back to working order.

-----------------EXPERIMENT #0010-----------------
On Operation: Dr. Ganya
On Deck: Dr. Cor

Iteration Summary:
This experiment used two-hundred and ten hops and other small details found in the .bmsys file.

Observations:
Octahedron expanded precisely 1mm in volume before triggering an explosion of gamma rays. Dr. Cor terminated the experiment as quickly as possible, as no cautionary state was entered. Debris was contained within the cage, but the integrity of the mechanism vastly deteriorated and requires replacement. Experiment aborted.

The configuration and full analytics file can be found in the containing folder.

Notes:
We simply have no idea what we are dealing with here. We don’t know what this thing is. None of our knowledge on sentient and Void technology seems to work on it, and there’s supposed to be a way to open it? We have no access to any of the object’s background for privacy reasons, so are we merely being forced to throw everything we have at this until something sticks? That’s all we can do! What’s more, the object is so wildly random that one of our brute force combinations may trigger it to kill us all in some horrible, unthinkable fashion. This is seriously frightening science.</div></span>

The greatly weakened operator let out a confused sort of grunt, rather weakly waving a hand in what might possibly have been interpreted as a struggle against the Wukong. He had to keep breaking things, right? Why was he being carried away? Being as dazed and confused as he was now, he had likely entirely forgotten what was going on with this whole thing. 

He managed to raise his hand, not really aiming at much in particular. Try as he might, only the smallest spark of void energy appeared from his amp before his body went limp again. Yep, he was tired. Exhausted, even.</span>

Closing her eyes as the light faded slightly, the Mirage looked around for a moment, her hands tense on her bow as she saw that her shadows had slowly vanished into the ethereal smoke. The feeling of not knowing if it even worked kinda nagged at her. Chegar&#39;s voice reached her asking about the  riddle in blood that they had seen earlier.

The operator racked her mind for a minute going back to that giant wall of the quick dried blood, turning toward the Vauban she yelled back, &quot;wasn&#39;t it something about sound to see? you got an idea?&quot;</span>

I felt one side of the Rhino flomp, telling me that the Frost either crashed or gave up. I stop and crack a eye towards him…which was a mistake by the brightness but I kept it open. <em>”What…</em>” I asked myself as he shot his demand, he didn’t seem to be even in a walking capability let alone carry. Then Kamos went all berserk again, as I feel him fire a shot or two over my shoulder and for once was glad that the energy got depleted as I felt him go limp. <em>”Now? Yes yes! Now!”</em> I let go of the Rhino, letting him smack down on the floor as I pull the limp boy from my shoulder, to gently hand him over to the Frost

“Go go, I’ll bring frame later”

I wave my right hand at him in a dismissive manner, hoping he b-lines for the front door as fast as he can.

Now, free of all burdens I turn to look over my shoulder towards the room and the central machine. The riddle talk came up making my face lit up with a excited smile “Ah yes yes!” I boom through the coms <em>”How did I forget?! BAH!</em>” 

“What eyes close? What we see? Yes yes! Something of it! We…” I break off as I notice a new set of claws encircle the machine and I pause, pulling all focus towards them, to wait to see if they make a move or well…till more info is handed out as to how we can trap this thing.</span>

At last, something more in his realm of expertise. He took Kamos&#39; limp body from Sonera and draped him over his shoulder, backing towards the door and trying to keep his eyes on the room. Feeling the doorframe against his shoulder, Leveret turned and stumbled out of the room, leaning against the wall sinking gratefully to the floor. It was nice to have a chance to rest... But he still had people to protect. Leveret adjusted his position so he was facing the wall with Kamos bundled in his arms, using his back to protect the small Tenno from danger.

When they were satisfied with how their frame was settled, Kinsey pushed themself backwards out of the Frost&#39;s hunched form and scrambled to their feet. For some reason, the impression they&#39;d seen in their eyes while still in their frame remained...? 

It was at this point they heard Inari&#39;s comment about the blood on the wall. &quot;Yes! Holy muck! When we looked away from the flash we closed our eyes!&quot; Kinsey yelled, hurrying back into the room.</span>

&#39;Well, this is hardly helpful.&#39; Aurelia grumbled to herself. If she could take anything from this file, it was that the cage for this creature was heavily damaged, something that had been obvious from the moment they entered this accursed room. The notes were of little help either in this instance, as the researchers that were working in this room seemed to know as little about what they were currently dealing with as she did. Wanting to be thorough, however, she opened the full analytics file, hoping there was something in there  that might actually point them in the right direction. While doing so, she spoke to Svytoj.

&quot;Truthfully, not much. It seems whoever was conducting research here was as blind as we are right now. As for closing our eyes, I wouldn&#39;t normally recommend it, but I&#39;m open to any idea at this point.&quot; She turned her attention back to the analytics file as it opened. &quot;Here&#39;s hoping this doesn&#39;t kill us.&quot; she mumbled.</span>

This time, it was much more focused and vivid. The markings showed something in front of them violently waving four appendages, on which long nails stretching at least two meters protruded from. The… thing somehow hung from the ceiling, and while the vibrant light didn’t give much detail, it was apparent that a massive orifice yawned open on its underside. Other than that, it was nothing but a ovaloid shape of burning light.

The analysis file was full of nothing but tables upon tables of environmental information over time. It seemed to measure stuff like temperature, gamma radiation levels, infrared light, etc. It even had data on the movement of gases in the air. Only one thing of note caught the Cephalon’s neuroptics: a 3d video featuring the model of a wireframe octahedron. Two seconds in, the shape very minutely increased in size and then moved in an animation similar to a tesseract. The video lasted four seconds.~</span>

I paused as the “order” went out to close our eyes again <em>”Da hek?</em>” confused but I obeyed cause might as well try it if everything else so far has failed. The light hit me again as soon as I did so and my mask wrinkled in discomfort. <em>”Huh</em>” Then it twisted to confusion, brows furrowing at the sudden shape that immerged against the whiteness.

“Uh…guys?! You seeing this too?”

I point at the ceiling, a mixture of amazement and excitement rising deep from within me</span>

With their frame safely stowed outside of the room, the tenno could focus on the matter at hand. They squeezed their eyes shut and focused on the writhing creature attached to the ceiling.

&quot;Rahm, that&#39;s one ugly sonofabitch! Well, stay away from the arms, obviously...anyone got any other ideas besides leaving the room and barricading the door? Because that&#39;s what I feel like we should do at this point.&quot;

They glanced back to their frame. &quot;I mean, we got injured folks, so we should probably focus on, you know, keepin&#39; them alive...&quot;</span>

He was... pretty out of it. Seriously. He didn&#39;t even try escaping. He was dazed, confused, close to passing out again... Wait, where was he? Why was he being held here? Who was holding him? He could <em>sort</em> of hear everything going on, but he... really couldn&#39;t comprehend what it was. No, he was too confused. He sort of leaned forward, putting an arm over the shoulder of the Frost, really not unlike a hug. It was <em>supposed</em> to keep him steady, but it also <em>really</em> looked like a hug. Maybe that was also his goal, who knows?

Where was Atela? Why wasn&#39;t she here? Again, too exhausted to remember. Why was he here without Atela? Right, she had gone... somewhere. Right. But where? Some... some thing... somewhere, right? Yes, that sounded right... Why couldn&#39;t he think straight? Whatever... Probably nothing... Once again, Kamos began to drift off back into unconsciousness as the exhaustion took over.</span>

Aurelia didn&#39;t quite have the time to go through this data properly, given the circumstances, but the environmental data seemed interesting enough for her to read through later, just in case there happened to be more of... whatever they were dealing with in the future. The video, however, was what truly caught her eye in the present moment. She recognized the shape of course, but it didn&#39;t make any sense. If the video was accurate, that would mean that they were dealing with some kind of extradimensional object or entity, the implications of which were enough for her to nervously raise her voice to the group as she copied the analysis file to the MOA&#39;s memory. 

&quot;Excuse me everyone, but I believe Kinsey is correct. If what I just read is correct, we may be dealing with a fourth dimensional entity of some sort.  Direct confrontation has not helped so far, so I suggest we leave as quickly and quietly as possible, and make sure this thing cannot follow us.&quot;</span>

Closing her eyes and shutting off her mirages visual optics, Inari could see the creature along with the other tenno,  looking up at the thing she was a little loss for words on how the hell she was suppose to describe this thing. Seeing it going for the pair of frosts she backed up slightly knocking an arrow into her Cernos, if they could see the thing maybe there was a better chance at hitting it now. Tracking the creature as it went for kinsey and chegar she let an arrow loose just ahead of it hoping that the arrow will meet it&#39;s target.

Turning back toward Aurelia, &quot;So is any of that data gonna help us or are we on our own here?&quot; she asked, hoping the AI was gonna have something slightly helpful for the group so this wouldn&#39;t go any any longer than it already had.</span>

Then a guttural cry poured from the mouth of the invisible beast. It flailed its limbs about, knocking over all who weren’t quick to react or agile enough to get away.~</span>

Really, he was too weak to do anything whatsoever. Outstanding move, Kamos. His pointless struggle continued as the rest fought this... thing, until he heard that scream. In an instant, he was cowering against the wall, shielding his face. &quot;Please... Atela... evac... Now...&quot; He said just a bit louder, his voice every bit as slurred as it was before.</span>

The creatures scream sent a bit of a chill across the operators skin, turning back, she could see the flailing arms as her bolt stuck out from it&#39;s glowing fleshy substance,  &quot;Sabaka, that thing has a scream!&quot; she said more to herself than the others. But now, this situation has changed, they could go on the offensive, or at least could distract the thing . The Ai&#39;s voice threw off Inari just slightly, was that actual desperation or was it simulated? she shrugged the question off for now focusing on the task at hand. 

 &quot;Alright so Aurelia see if you can figure the process of least capturing this thing and  we can run distraction to get the two out i figure?&quot; she asked speaking of the defeated Rhino operator and the wounded wukong.</span>

The creature’s deadly sharpened nails retreated from their battlefield amidst the icy floor. They rose into the air like leaping serpents to lash at one of the vents in the ceiling. Fortunately, the ice Leveret had previously woven across everything managed to shield the fiend’s onslaught. The barrier was very thin, however, and there was no telling if it could fall victim to those savage claws.

All the while, a strange amalgamation of a guttural roar and a squeak frantically licked the groups’ ears.~</span>

I grit my teeth as the creature let out it’s crippling screech, my hands shooting up to block the non-existing ears of my Wukong but instead of distress, my maw showed a gleeful smile <em>”We can touch it! Yes yes!”</em> Noticing the flailing arms I quickly hop and dodge around them with the agility and grace of a dancer in the middle of the dance floor. Three steps left, two steps front, hop, barrel roll, jump, left twirl, corkscrew to the right, wall push leading to a crouch, frontflip. Instead of dancing my way out, I push deeper, towards the Rhino’s Galatine that I left abandoned on the floor.

Not stopping my flips and hops, I pick it up from the floor in a barrel roll, and stop in a crouch from it, holding the grand sword like a spear, aiming at the creature. I pause for a split second and let loose the sword with all my strength, towards the base of of one of the appendage, hoping I put just enough strength to impale the sword through it and imbed in the ceiling, trapping that appendage and preferably the creature too…for a moment.</span>

It figured. She had managed to evade the creature&#39;s notice all this time, but the one time it actually hit her was when it wasn&#39;t intentionally trying to do so. The hit was a solid one that sent the MOA flying across the room before slamming into the far wall and falling to the floor. The impact alone was enough to cause some feedback on her connection to the MOA, but the claw itself had done worse damage. Sparks flew from the hip joint of the MOA&#39;s left leg as she tried to get it to stand back up, all the while being quite grateful she couldn&#39;t feel pain. She wasn&#39;t paying much attention to the ongoing dialogue of the group, instead desperately trying to make sure the proxy was still usable, while hoping the creature didn&#39;t continue its assault on it.</span>

Sonera’s stalwart spear punched a hole through the creature’s carapace, and slid into its place. A dull <em>thunk</em>, much more deafening and impactful than the last, reverberated throughout the dimly lit laboratory. The galatine managed to unintentionally pierce through the thin barrier between the ceiling and the overhead vents, skewering the beast in the air.

The scratching stopped, the limbs fell, and silence returned all too suddenly, leaving an invisible puppet dangling on invisible strings.

&quot;Fine, thank you.&quot; Aurelia responded somewhat shakily, the static in her voice more intense than usual.  There was a quiet hum as the MOA&#39;s rather pathetic shields began to restore themselves after the hit they had received. Overall, the MOA was rather battered, but it should remain functional as long as nothing else hits it too hard. A few sparks flew from the more damaged hip joint of the proxy, but Aurelia was able to will the machine forward and away from the wall. moving with a slight limp, the MOA approached the group again and gazed upward at the energy field the Vauban had put up. &quot;Did you capture it?&quot;</span>

&quot;Actually, it looks like it&#39;s dead.&quot; The commented before slipping away from the group to check on Kamos.

Turns out it was a good thing they did, because the over exhausted tenno was struggling weakly in their frame&#39;s embrace, resisting Svy&#39;s attempts to help.
&quot;Okay, danger&#39;s gone for now, so we can move <em>you</em> out of the way...&quot; they muttered, pushing the hunched frost into a more upright position. Though the frame had been completely stiff before, it moved almost effortlessly at Kinsey&#39;s touch, also allowing its grip around Kamos to be loosened until the tenno was only being gently supported. As an afterthought, Kinsey wiped the colorful dribble of blood and coolant from the front of their frame&#39;s helmet, rubbing their hand on their pants.

&quot;Hey buddy, hey, Kamos...it&#39;s okay, stay still alright?&quot; They said gently, trying to calm him.</span>

Before Kinsey got a response... Kamos was back to struggling against Svytoj&#39;s attempts to fix him. Well, not like he struggled directly against the Frost. No, the needle was yanked out, almost instantly. The dazed Kamos held a hand over the spot it had been poked in, as he flopped back onto the ground again. His eyes were open, but... well, just barely, really. Finally, he glanced up at Kinsey, shaking his head no. To what in particular, was unclear.</span>

Kinsey really wasn&#39;t expecting him to just yank the needle out, but they supposed it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise given how he&#39;d been acting up to this point. 
Kamos clearly wasn&#39;t entirely lucid at the moment, so they made an effort to get through to him- and also distract him from Svy.

&quot;Kamos, hey. Look at me, look...&quot; they repeated, trying to hold his attention, &quot;danger&#39;s all gone, yeah? You&#39;re gonna be fine, just don&#39;t move too much.&quot;</span>

There was a moment. An all too brief moment where Aurelia almost felt relief, thinking that with the monstrosity either dead or incapacitated, they might have a moment to relax. With the appearance of those glowing patterns, however, that relief practically disintegrated. In an effort to be useful, Aurelia began scanning the patterns on the floor, comparing them against every pattern she had on file for possible connections and meanings. &quot;The MOA will be fine, just try to make sure it doesn&#39;t take any further damage, will you?&quot; She paused for a moment, before adding, &quot;I&#39;d prefer you call me Aurelia, if its all the same to you.&quot;</span>

The Tenno patted Kamos&#39; cheek with one hand, making sure he wasn&#39;t going to wake up.
&quot;Aaaand...yep, he&#39;s out again. Ok, Svy, do whatever doctor shit you gotta do before he wakes up again, yeah? He&#39;s just burning energy at this point.&quot;

Kinsey was too focused on helping Kamos to notice anything going on with the strange object. If anything were to happen, it would likely take them by surprise.</span>

<strong>SVYTOJ</strong>
“Yep...” Svytoj said, somewhat absently, to Kinsey. The frost covered the first IV site, and prepped Kamos’ other are for a new one. With the needle in, Svytoj hooked Kamos to a saline drip, and fitted him with an O2 mask.
“Alright...” Svytoj said, pulling out his synth scanner once more. “Let’s see what’s goin’ on with ya...” He said, scanning the Tenno for anything that could explain Kamos’ symptoms.</span>

There was nothing. Not a single thing in her files about what those symbols meant or where they came from. That, even more than the object&#39;s apparent physical qualities, worried her.  Of course, it stood to reason that this object was likely connected to that eldritch horror Sonera had just impaled. A body perhaps? 

&quot;Sonera, please be careful with that, we still don&#39;t know the nature of that thing.&quot; The MOA began backing up towards the door, making sure not to let the strange sphere out of sight.</span>

Watching as Sonera picked up the strange device she backed up a little not wanting to be close to something pulsing and that no one had a clue what it was, she&#39;d tell the wukong to put it down, but for some reason she felt like Sonera wouldn&#39;t pay her much mind. 

Keeping a small distance from the wukong and the glowing object she walked to the pile of metal and parts that was the MOA, the mirage crouched down onto her haunches and gave it a look over, her head cocked to one side,  extending a gauntlet she reached out and slight rapped on the outer casing, &#39;well looks no worse for wear, can it walk or we gonna have to play tech surgeon?&#39;</span>

Strands of her hair gently slapped the back of her head as they tossed back and forth in the wind. A wind, that wafted the intoxicating smell of burning gasoline right to her nose. Her vision faded in and out of focus like an old camera filming an action sequence. Through her swimming sight, Sonera could recognize some walls to her left and right made out of a high-contrast orokin colour scheme. Walls? They were more like… guard rails. But, what was beyond them? What was above her? 

Some structure seemed to stand in front of her, but she couldn’t make it out. It was drowning in too many flames. Pretty flames. They complemented the grass she stood on.

It was a funny thing. Her limbs were deprived of the sense of touch. She couldn’t even feel the octahedron still sitting in her palm, ablaze with a blinding light. Her ears wouldn’t hear a sound other than her own heavy breathing.

And a deep, thunderous ambience.

To the others in the room, however, she was merely frozen in place.~</span>

<em>blink</em>
I am walking towards the group, object in hand, tail swishing in delight.
<em>blink</em>
I’m…huh?
I pause mid step as I’ve been thrown in a area I did not recognize, all out of the blue <em>”Grass? Where…am I not on…</em>”. My gaze flying left and right in a confused and panicked dance, looking for the others or anything that would point me that I’m still in the room I was in just seconds ago, but they are nowhere near. <em>”I fell asleep? No no…too fast! Dream? Illusion? No no…what is it? Where is it? Feels…</em>”I look down at myself to find that I am no longer operating my Wukong but am me as myself in my trashed transference suit, my vision clouded by the grineer mask that rests upon my face. There was a wind, a breeze that danced across my short fiery hair, capturing my attention. I smell…<em>”What is it? Ash? Fire starters! Where?</em>” My breathing fastened as my brain raged to find answers.

I gaze at my surrounding once more, but with each blink it feels more sluggish to do so, as if I’m looking through a fogged lens, unable to focus for too long. <em>”Ahhhh…what is this? No like no like…how?</em>” I capture the burning structure that cracked before me, my eyes squinting to stay focused on it but failing as my focus swirls in the mist like grain, making me growl in annoyance. I lift my free hand to slap my head as if that action could rid the mist from my eyes “Focus, focus” I mumble under my breath. I try to make out what it is that is burning, the cackling flames reflecting off my emerald traced cyan eyes. <em>&quot;It&#39;s...pretty...but...violent, what&#39;s burning...will it eat me?</em>&quot;

“I’m…”</span>

Looking up from the MOA she noticed that the wukong was simply standing in there not running chattering away, which in the short time inari had been working in this thrown together team, already seemed a bit off. Giving a reassuring pat on the casing of the downed mech the mirage got up from her crouched stance walking toward the Wukong waving a hand, &quot;hey chatterbox, you alright?&quot; she waved a few times but still no response, &#39;ummm tenno and cephalon alike, i think there may be something up with our talkative friend here&#39;.

&quot;It could be in better condition, but it will do for now. Thank you.&quot; Aurelia answered somewhat awkwardly. It was rather unexpected that someone would take that much interest in her wellbeing, even if it was just a proxy. On another topic, the others were right, something was clearly wrong with the Wukong. Aurelia wasn&#39;t sure if she had seen that Tenno stand still for that long  since they had gotten here. &quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure what&#39;s wrong, but...&quot;  Taking a few hesitant steps towards the motionless frame, Aurelia stared at the orb still sitting in her hand. &quot;I&#39;m sure this has something to do with it.&quot;</span>

The flames suddenly sharpened in Sonera’s vision. Before her stretched an orokin complex of some sort presently burning to the ground. Sonera was probably located to the side of it, where a horribly mangled sliding door invited her inwards. The heat-warped piece of scrap sparked occasionally as if coughing up a lung on a dying breath.

Then, in another blink of an eye, the Tenno found herself holding the hand of another Tenno.

At once, Inari was whisked away into the same place Sonera stood, holding her left hand with the same one that was once grasping the mysterious object. She was in her operator as well, her beautiful white hair clinging to her face for dear life in the raging wind. Inari’s amazonic height practically dragged Sonera’s arm horizontally in her grip. She and Sonera shared the same amount of sensational impairment.

...

Back in the room, both Sonera and Inari’s warframes stood as silent architecture amidst the darkened backdrop. Only the <em>drip, drip, drip,</em> of Svytoj’s saline solution and the low hum of the station spoke.

Until the elevator started up.

<em>WHIRRRR!</em>  Its doors gave a nasty screech when they closed for departure that echoed across the series of hallways.~</span>

&quot;what the...&quot; she said as the whole view of the station was immediately changed to an open land that stretched as far as her eyes could make out, however something felt out of place, almost like an out of body experience. Looking to the grass below her confirmed the feeling as she was no longer within her mirage, Ami ,  but in her own body with the feeling of soft wind blowing her white hair against her face, and at the same time the feel of heat from the flames against her skin sent small shivers through her, this felt too real to be her imagination. 

The feeling of a hand in hers took  her attention away from her surroundings for a second to  look down, at another tenno, the smaller girl had the same look of bewilderment that she was feeling. The shock of the sudden change held back any thought process for a few moments as she looked between the smaller tenno and the environment around them, remembering who she was with before the shift her head snapped down again to the other tenno and only a single name came from her lips, &quot;s...sonera?&quot;</span>

“Huh…no hurt, no eat…nothing” I mumble under my breath as the flames licked around my hand without it hurting or appearing to take damage. I blink and take heed of the parting flames as the structure starts appearing sharper in my muddy vision <em>”A door? Yes yes! Go in? Do I-</em>” My thoughts were cut short as all of a sudden I felt someone grasp my hand and tug it upwards.

“Wh-“

I blink, once, twice, thrice, to try and make sense of this…but no sense came. A tenno, a girl, tall and white haired, appeared in front of me out of the blue, I had to look up to see her face for my own reached just at her bosoms. <em>”Whoa…she’s tall…strong….</em>” I glance at our joint hands, the situation somewhat silly due to our height difference and the heavy atmosphere that surrounds us. My ears perk up at the mention of my name and I scrunch up my brows, a motion that lays hidden to the other due to the Grineer mask that rests on my face. <em>”She knows me? Who…female…only female frame that was with us is…</em>”

“Uh…yeah…are you…Inari?”

I ask her, puzzled about her sudden appearance. Then a thought hit me and I look down to my right hand which was curled up in to a fist. I open it to find the object that I picked up still resting calmly atop it…albeit I felt no weight of it or…anything really.

“Did you touch it too?” I look back up at her</span>

Exhaustion; simple exhaustion. Some saline, maybe a rally pack, and Kamos should be fine. Preoccupied with this patient, Svytoj looked inside his kit for a rally pack, somehow not hearing Kinsey’s question.

He only stopped at the sound of the screeching doors, head whipping to look towards the sound . He froze, then slowly turned to face Kinsey.
“O...kay, I didn’t like that sound” he said, taking the time to affix an o2 mask to Kamos’ face.

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
“Hey, Svytoj, I’ve got a possible problem.”
“What’s up?”
“The  glowing ball; two people just touched it, and now they’re not moving.”
Svytoj’s head shot up, now looking toward the door.  “They collapsed?”
“No-“ Chegar replied. “They’re standing here. Not moving.”
“You need some more hands in there?”
“Maybe?” Chegar replied cautiously.
“Okay...” Svytoj said, now looking at Kinsey again. “Kiddo here is just overexerted himself a bit, so he should be up again soon enough. That said, we have a situation in there. Again.” He said, gesturing to the open doorway. “ I can take care of the kid if you wanna take a look.”</span>

She nodded at the little tenno&#39;s question, looking at the burning Orokin structure as she spoke, &#39;i barely touched it with mirage&#39;s hand, whatever that thing is, it&#39;s powerful&#39;. Looking down at their hands clasped together, a small thought of intrigue entered the taller tenno&#39;s mind as she looked from her hand to the object in Sonera&#39;s other hand, &#39;i wonder...&#39; she mumbled in a low tone, as her fingers slowly unlocked from around the tiny tenno&#39;s hand gently slipping her hand out of the grasp of Sonera. 

Looking at her hand for a moment Inari looked around again noticing that she had not returned to the room but was still stuck in, wherever they were, with Sonera. Placing her gloved hands on her hips, the taller tenno let out a low &quot;humph&quot; she returned her gaze to Sorena with a look of slight disappointment, but at the same time a bit of intrigue, &quot;well...whatever is going on here, looks like we are stuck for now&#39;.</span>

&quot;Yeah, ok. I&#39;ll go check it out. You might want to take a look at his frame, too, I-&quot;

Kinsey suddenly stopped talking, grimacing and staring off into nothing for a moment. &quot;Vilkas!&quot; they hissed, switching effortlessly to Grineer, &quot;&lt;WHAT! What do you WANT? I&#39;m in the middle of something here! It must be damn important for you to override the mute!&gt;&quot;

Do I hold one back there too?</em>” I pondered for a moment, but soon my thoughts became consumed by this rapid growing impulse and instinct, something that takes a hold of me like hundred of tinny ants gnawing and nudging at the back of my head, each whispering “Throw it”

I am a creature, a slave of such whims, so I do as the “ants” commanded

I lift my hand up and chuck the object towards the fire, maybe this will snap us back to reality? Or make things worse? Or nothing will happen at all? Whatever it is, I feel like the outcome might be FUN FUN</span>

Well, lack of sky. It may have seen unclear at first but now it was definitely certain: the only thing upwards was an inky black expanse.

Well that did nothing! I watched as the object dinged and clanged on the grass, seeming unfazed. I shrugged my shoulders and turn to look at the taller one “Well…I got nothing…so wh-“ The sudden shift silenced me and I blinked, turning my gaze to the darkness above

“Uh…that can’t be good…”

I look towards the burning building and the object on the grass, I walk over to pick it up since it might prove useful or well, could be a key to getting out of here…IF this one is in fact real and not a illusion. <em>”Could be…yes yes! But, better to carry! Yes yes!</em>”

“Hide? Inside? Something is coming I feel…”

I point with my chin towards the burning building…I remember seeing a door somewhere but…I squint my eyes, trying to spot it again from this haze that has engulfed my vision.</span>

Watching as Sonera threw the item from her hand almost brought a complaint from the taller Tenno, however her voice was silent as her vision felt like it had become more focused, as if there was some haze they had not previously known was consuming them, now vanished. Looking up the ink blackness of the sky had a slightly unsettling effect on her. 

Hearing the younger tenno&#39;s rambles, Inari herself felt an uneasy presence like they were not alone on this field, &#39;agreed it does feel like something besides us is here&#39;. The whole thing was getting a bit much but she had to try and keep herself together and work with Sonera if they were gonna get back to the station in one piece.  &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; she asked seeing Sonera&#39;s concentration focused upon the Orokin structure.</span>

~Sure enough, the door was still there, waiting. Their vision of it was clear along with the hall it attached to. Inside, broken wires hanging from the ceiling pointed to deep, ash-clogged cuts in the walls. There were two torn holes on either side that they could see, likely the traces of doorways, and a bend to the right at the end.~</span>

“A-HA!” I yell out all of a sudden. Giving Inari no time to recuperate from my sudden shout, I grab the taller one by the wrist and drag her along through the door, knowing full well that the flames won’t hurt me <em>”Does she know? BAH!</em>” Inari will find that even tho I am short and small in status, my physical strength is like that of a ape and she would probably feel like she got pulled by a wild kubrow.

Once through the door, I look around, my emerald-cyan eyes darting around the wild flames

“Familiar?” I ask Inari as I look over my shoulder, my hand dropping from her wrist

“Feels weird…why burn? Is it saying something to us?”</span>

They peered up at the warframes and the orb. &quot;Anyone tried poking them yet? Not the orb, you know,&quot; they motioned vaguely at the two Tenno, &quot;them.&quot;

Any damage Kinsey&#39;s Frost had sustained seemed to be internal. The only evidence of injury was the smear of blood and orange-gold coolant leaking from the front of the warframe&#39;s helmet.</span>

Getting pulled into the flames by the smaller tenno was something she really did not think at possible, though if one thing the tenno often showed to the rest of the sol system, was the truth that size wasn&#39;t everything, the little one had quite a grip and inari swore she heard some kubrow fibers in her suit snap from her arm getting tugged. 

The thought of telling the wild tenno to hold off from the flames came to her a few moments too late as they both stood within the confides of the structure, yet as the fire licked against her gloved hand, and her white hair danced amidst the reds and oranges of the flames no real heat touched her, her suit did not burn, it was one hell of an oddity for sure.

The moment almost consumed her attention to the point the little ones words were passed, yet she was still able to answer though be it with some doubt, &quot;i can not say any of this seems familiar to me Sonera, and i also can&#39;t seem to understand what that...&quot;she said point toward the object in Sonera&#39;s hand, &quot;is trying to show us or say to us&quot;</span>

~Now inside, Inari and Sonera bore witness to two utterly decimated rooms. One held loads of trashed machinery and glass centered around what probably used to be a massive tank, not barely recognizable. Etched into a single sign at the entrance of the second room were the words ‘CULTIVATION-03’ in orokin script.

The other room featured the label ‘RESTRAINT-02’. The interior was filled with broken white-and-gold chains. These chains mounted to the walls and all pointed to once being attached to something at the end of the room. A couple monitors and such stood on whatever legs they had left, but one plaque-like terminal in the corner seemed intact. It was hard to tell with all the ash covering its surface.~</span>

Not gonna lie, standing in a burning building, surrounded by fire that doesn’t hurt you and smoke that doesn’t choke you feels…AMAZING! Looks at this shit! I wave my hand through the flames and smile as it licks around it. <em>”Feels powerful! Yes yes! Like I command it!</em>” It’s when the tall one talks do I snap out of it and look around

“Huh…strange yes yes!”

I huffed out and started walking towards the first room, my vision blurred by the obstruction of the flame and whatever filter reigned in this place. I take notice of the sign and look over my shoulder to Inari, pointing at the sign with my free hand “What’s it say? Is it good?” Before turning my head back to gaze at the room inside and at the machinery and broken glass. <em>”Ahhhh! Looks inviting!</em>”</span>

~A shiny object flashed like a beacon amidst the rubble. Sonera could easily recognize a speaker of some sort poking out, softly wailing faint sounds into the thunderous ambiance. Whatever was playing wasn&#39;t audible from her current position.

Inari brushed away a sheet of soot, puffing a small black cloud into the turbulent air. The terminal featured a wire-frame portrait depicting an unknown beast. It was a giant, vaguely humanoid creature sporting six tendrils from its back, and a hunched avian head. The monster had less neck than an Atlas warframe. Surrounding it on the display were eight shackle icons, each with the label &quot;0%&quot; on them.

Residing over all this information sat the elegant Orokin words &quot;Psycharam-09&quot;.~</span>

Looking down at the terminal, something about the wireframe outline of a creature seemed oddly familiar, &#39;Sonera&#39; she called over her shoulder, &#39;come here real quick, i wanna see if this looks familiar to you&#39;.

My eyes quickly catch the shiny spark from within one of the rooms and like moth to a flame (again) I leap inside to walk towards it. If there was a lesson to be learned from my previous attracter to a shiny object - ultimately the one that landed us in this place to begin with - then that lesson sure didn&#39;t stick to me...like at all!

I take notice of the sounds spilling from it, my curiosity only growing stronger due to it. I crouch down in front of it, trying to focus my loosing vision on it. I am so captured by it that Inari&#39;s words didn&#39;t even register to me. <em>&quot;What is it? What is it?! A soundbox? Tell me what you make?! The sounds! Yes yes!</em>&quot;</span>

~Another distant screech echoed its way through the empty halls and eerily settled into the group’s ears. A few moments later, the whirr of the elevator called out amidst the drowning dim light and sonorous lull of the station. It sounded like it was on its way back down.~</span>

~Sonera heard not sounds, but talking. The device wasn’t really much more than one speaker, so it looked easy to hold. One heavily robotic voice called out of it. “Repeat, experiment two seven eight has escaped. Repeat, experiment two seven eight has escaped…”

When Inari’s fingers touched one of the percentage numbers, a small dialogue box popped overtop of it that read ‘PSIONIC ENERGY SHACKLE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY’. Another press on the title yielded another box with a short blurb of text.

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-md">#09 Entry in Psycharam prototype series. Most promising specimen. See Experiment #405 for details on cultivation procedure and refer to the handling section for cell maintenance procedures.</div>

<em><strong>KABOOM!</strong></em>   Inari missed checking out on the rest of it when a violent explosion somewhere else in the building rocked the entire structure they stood in, forcing the walls to wobble and glass to crack. Both Tenno almost lost their footing in the process. Inari heard a sickening zap, and the terminal cut off to black, killing her only lead inside the room. A couple pieces of debris moving too fast to see flung themselves onto the wall of the bend back in the hallway and ricocheted past both rooms’ doors. 

After the brief disruption, Sonera suddenly found the message coming from the speaker had changed. A low voice filled with static spilled forth in very slow syllables. “K...”</span>

“Whoa…cool” I mumble under my breath as I listened to the voices spilling from it. Unlike my vision, they seemed more focused and understandable. I reached out with my left hand to grasp it. <em>”Two seven eight? Have I seen them somewhere? Feel like…</em>” But before my hand could reach it…

<strong>KABOOM</strong>

The sudden explosion knocked any though out of my head and replaced it with bright blaring red alarms, all telling me to snap the hell out and take ACTION. Like a switch, I go in to survival mode and quickly snatch the speaker from the floor before shooting up and darting out of the room, the aftershock almost toppling me over but I manage to keep my balance while running.

“Inari!”

I yell out as I poke my head inside the other room, where I last saw her

“What happened? You alright?”</span>

Reading the few bits of information it seemed to her that whatever these thigns were, was  possibly one of the many experiments that the Orokin were doing. Her finger reached toward the screen to tap on it for more information....

KABOOM

The shock of the explosion within the structure sent the tall tenno offer her balance  ,her hands grabbing onto the side of the screen trying to hold it for balance, but she was brought to her knees quickly, the sounds of wires being snapped out of place and stretched beyond their limits was accompanied by a electrical zap. Getting back to her feet she looked down at the screen which had gone blank, all the information now gone. Trying to tap the screen a few times her frustration started building to the point she was smacking and punching the screen &quot;damnit!&quot; she hollered out hitting the screen one last time.

Hearing Sonera&#39;s voice from the entry way she turned letting out a loud huff, &#39;yeah i&#39;m ok, just lost a possible lead is all, but what the void was that?&#39; she wondered as it seemed this place was gonna be full of surprises.</span>

The operator grunted, finally stirring a bit. Was he waking up? Instinctively, he clutched at his scorched wrist, rolling over onto his side. He grunted again, eyes finally opening once more.

The triple-reinforced locking mechanism blew off its hinges.

A deadly torrent of ferrite shards and shrapnel tore through a room connector on-board a Grineer sealab. Masses of stone-faced Grineer Lancers reflexively ducked behind their scattered covers. Today was not a glorious day. One particular lancer near the front of the troop took the initiative and peek around his well-worn blunt to check for enemies.

He looked just in time to see a small grenade roll past him.

<em><strong>BAM.</strong></em> An excruciatingly bright light blinded everyone in the room, and a deafening crack robbed them of their hearing. Disorientated, the group fired their weapons sporadically as more well-placed shots downed them one by one. The first lancer, frothing at the mouth from rage and passion for the Kweens, steeled himself and whirled around to fire upon the intruders.

He instantly ate two rounds to the face from a dual cestra weidling woman sliding along the ground with a jetpack.

As his dying corpse fell to the floor, the enemy kicked hard on the blunt in order to convert her momentum into a vault, and succeeded. She landed in the middle of a troop-turned-graveyard in a little under twenty seconds, stretching her tight, grey bodysuit on landing. A small puff of smoke rose to the heavens from a dull-white alloy armour piece sitting upon her breast. Several more pieces adorned vital points around her body. 

Not hesitating a single second, she removed a wicked data-knife her lower back and plunged it into a gigantic computer before her. A cord ejected itself from the back of her full-face helmet, which she hurriedly nabbed and connected to the hacking tool.</span>

&quot;Damn, you&#39;d figure Grineer labs would have better security.

Enya freed her left hand from tapping away at the keyboard and brushed a bit of powdered rust off Cyrus’s shoulder with a smile, then continued her work.

“Even more, since this place is actually part of some secret ‘COE’ organization apparently. Glad to have such reliable mercs with me,” she teased giving his shoulder a quick squeeze, “and I got a request from a friend who’s a big-shot in some probably shady Corpus company by the name of slash-RU Corp, right? Well, they’ve been scrambling like crazy in the last couple of hours trying to find something they lost.”

Anxiety began to weigh down on her shielded expression with each passing second. A sprawling field of yellow text  raced down the screen, displaying a manifest for special cargo. She filtered them by subject type, and scrolled down to ‘person’. “Sorry, some<em>one</em>. We’re looking for a list of people gone missing.”

“Oi! Stop gawking and swap out, eh?” He called over to Chegar. The Vauban stepped back, looked at the open door, and made a bee-line towards them.

&quot;Agreed.&quot; Aurelia stated, nodding along with Chegar&#39;s concerns.  &quot;While I would argue against trying to remove them, we may not have a choice when whatever is making that racket finds us. For now, we seem to have two options: we may either try to ambush whatever is coming in the hallway, or we attempt to fortify this room as well as we can and hope we can hold out.&quot; Aurelia&#39;s brow would be furrowed, if she still had one. Neither option seemed especially appealing, but what choice did they have? At about this time she realized Kamos was finally coming around.

looking down at the small speaker in Sonera&#39;s hand, the taller tenno gently tapped at it with her glvoed hand hearing the fragmented words sputtering out of the broken speaker, &#39;experiment two seven eight huh?&#39; a few thoughts immediately kicked around the the tenno&#39;s head, and none that she was really liking. First, was 278 just a number that was attached to that being, or was it the 278th creature that they had made. 

This of course leading to her second thought, and the one that sent a slight chill down her spine, where were the other 277 experiments if that was the case, are they still alive, and are they back on that station or in this plain of existence with her and the little one. Both thoughts were not too good to her and left them in quite the situation. 

&quot;Yeah let&#39;s hop we don&#39;t run into an experiment two seven seven or two seven nine while we are here yeah?&#39; she said toward the energetic Tenno, &quot;well guess all we can do now is keep looking, yes?&quot;</span>

She paused for a moment, reassured that they hadn&#39;t lost anyone just yet. That being said, their situation was still far from ideal and sitting here waiting for whatever may or may not be coming for them.

&quot;That may be the case, but we don&#39;t know for sure. Even if its nothing, we still need to find a way out of this station.&quot; The screaming metal, coupled with the stress of the situation was starting to give Aurelia a bit of a headache. Amidst this din, however, she managed to scrape together something of an idea. With an air of purpose, Aurelia directed the MOA out into the hallway and turned towards the origin of the sound before calling back to the group.

&quot;Svtoj, would you be willing to come with me? Perhaps we&#39;ll be able to see if anything is coming this way.&quot;</span>

&quot;Kil...?&quot; I tilt my head to the side, like a confused puppy as I line up the words that have spilled from the speaker thus far <em>&quot;Kill? Does it want us to kill something? OR! Has it killed? Is it coming for us?!</em>&quot; My spiraling train of thought was broken when I heard Inari speak making me blink and shake my head

&quot;Hear? Hm...&quot;

I perk my head up to listen and catch the noise Inari was refering to

&quot;Ah! Yes yes!&quot;

I look around the room, wanting to take something with me as a weapon, noticing the shattered glass. I pocket the red glowing object in to a hidden compartment in my transference suit and bent over to pick up the shard with my hand. I look up at Inari and nod my head to her as if telling her that we&#39;re combat ready!

I step out in to the hallway and follow the noise, keeping the glass shard in front of me while I hold the speaker with my other hand.</span>

“l…” the speaker drowned onwards, as if trying to confirm Sonera’s suspicions. The Tenno’s investigation takes her around the bend of the hallway, where it suddenly widened and opened up to an area with broad ramps leading up to the second level of the building on her left and right. They were littered with Orokin-age Grineer corpses.

Directly in front, a massive glass pane offered a view outside. More grass and rubble sat ablaze with flame like a beautiful sunset underneath the swirling black sky. This is where Sonera located the source of the beeping. A tall man garbed in regal orokin robes clutched his ribs with one arm. On it clung a gold, ornate armband that was flashing red without appearing to have any LEDs on it, and was the source of the beeping. The other arm… was nowhere to be found. 

He was slouched along the glass inside, head lolled backwards. Even in his battered state, the man sported both beautiful features and an imposing stature. Truly an Orokin.

Walking behind Sonera, she knelt down quickly picking up a discarded chain, gently wrapping it around her gloved knuckles like a large pair of brass knuckles, giving herself a form of self-defence along with her little companion.  As they headed into the larger room with the ramps strewn with the bodies of all old grineer, &#39;mother above, they look like they got butchered here&#39;.

Seeing the giant window pane she looked above Sonera&#39;s head to the field of fire that was before them both, slowly as the taller tenno&#39;s eyes panned down from the deadly beauty, the sight of the Orokin caught her full attention with only &quot;what the...&quot; escaping her lips.</span>

~Aurelia and Svytoj, now just behind the corner of the first hall, both heard the sound of something small pounding against metal. It was peculiar, but when they rounded the corner they would be greeted with a mostly closed elevator. A small, slanted crack in the doors betrayed signs of it jamming, but it was enough to get a view in if one moved close enough.~</span>

I pause as I hear the last letter spew from the speaker, confirming my suspicion <em>”Can we…die here? Is it true? Hallucination?</em>” I pondered for a second before shaking it off and continuing onwards, up the corpse littered staircase, my eyes scanning the bodies for their wounds or what killed them as I pass them. 

Once above I linger by the doorway as I look about the room, the beautiful scene flying over my head as I focus on the dead Orokin dude, definitely flinging up some red flags in my head. 

“Hey! Psssst! You alive!?”

I holler at the top of my lungs, as I softly step inside the room towards the Orokin like a timid squirrel, my eyes daring around the room just in case this was a trap and something is lingering. 

”Is this recent? Am I seeing the past of how that thing got out? Is this the guy that found it? Tried to tame it? Trap it?” I mumble out loud as I ponder on the scene</span>

The man’s eyes lazily pulled up into milky-white crescent moons. A sigh escaped his lips with an air so strong one would think he just breathed his life away. Then, he focused on the excitable operator.

“ha ha ha… Tenno. Why…? I must be going delirious...” he breathed, his voice a mix of exasperation and melody. Still beautiful amidst death. The Orokin languidly picked himself up into a sitting position.

“But… I know I am a fool but...” his shaved brow furrowed, “can you… can I have your assistance?”

<em>BWUINNG.</em> <em>BWUINNG.</em> <em>BWUINNG.</em>

An ominous booming approached the top of the ramparts from somewhere further down the conjoining corridor.

I stop my advance as the Orokin spoke. My gaze dances around the room once more as he sighed his words, still finding this whole situation suspicious. <em>”A-hhhhh. He lives…too bad too bad…a live one deserves less trust</em>”

I listen to him, my masked face hiding my wrinkled expression. And then the booming came, causing me to twitch my body towards it, like a allerted rabbit.

“Inari…”

I hush out, my tone calmer, sterner and deeper than the usual high-pitched squeal. I turn my emerald eyes towards her “See what he wants” And point with my chin towards the Orokin.

Glass shard in hand, I turn to poke my head out the door and gaze around the flaming corridor, watching the halls for the tiniest of movements.</span>

Seeing the Orokin still alive sent a bit of a chill up her spine, seeing one of those that had used them as mere tools alive and asking for aid brought her absolutely no comfort. Hearing the tone of arrogance in his voice made the taller tenno grip the restraint chain wrapped around her knuckles on her right hand almost wanting to punch the smug look off his face.

Her head snapped toward the direction of the loud booming but also heard Sonera&#39;s more controlled tone of voice, she seemed different than the rambunctious self she had been portraying up to this point. For the short time Inari had known the energetic girl, this one time, it felt like whatever was gonna happen, she could take care of it. 

&quot;yeah i&#39;ll see what the bastard wants&quot;

She wasn&#39;t happy about having to deal with Orokin, but in the weird situation both of them were in, he may have a way to get them out. Kneeling down in front of  him in  a sitting position she looked up into his milky eyes, &#39;Alright Orokin....speak&quot; She said in a cold demeanor.</span>

Svytoj’s headlamp and polished blade managed to send enough light through the crack between the doors to illuminate the elevator. It also prompted a small gasp to ring off the thin walls. The Tenno was granted a good view inside.

There—on the floor of that haunted structure—cowered a small, Corpus child.</span>

“h…..”

~Sonera poked her head into the hall and found another scorched and scarred interior. There were six rooms spaced apart here, but fire seemed to be filling all of them like a greedy liquid. She could make out some pitch-black, humanoid figure wrapped in worn yellow bandage standing at the far end of the hall with its back turned.~

The man gave something that was half-cough and half-laugh. He regarded the interrogative Tenno with a smile laced with lunacy and a twinkle in his eye. 

“Well then Tenno,” he started, before the words stopped coming from his mouth despite its telegraph of them. Instead it reverberated from the octahedron in Sonera’s pocket—now fiercely vibrating—in a deeper, booming voice.

“...I   w i l l   t a k e   t h a t   a s   a   y e s.   T h a n k   y o u.”

The Orokin lifted a wiry finger towards the two Tenno, and their hands began to burn. 

Searing pain shot through their arm as symbols were carved on the back of their hands right in front of their eyes. The marks blazed with a light bright enough to easily cut through the fabric of their operator suits.</span>

{THERE’S A KID IN THE ELEVATOR.}  Svytoj finally said, his message scrawling itself across the HUD of every Tenno and Tenno associate in the group.

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
“But Lev, slamming into walls happens to be the best part of our job.” Chegar replied, flicking some sparks of void energy from his wrist with a smirk directed at  leveret.

Then Svytoj’s scrawl came over his hud.

Strange, even when I know that I cannot hear Adus, I still hear the blaring red alarms that he throws at me when he senses possible danger. This, the words spilling from the speaker, the building, everything! <em>I could really use that…</em>  The sight of the tar-coated humanoid sent a jolt of dread running down my spine and pooling around my stomach…it feels uncomfortable, heavy, familiar. It does not frighten me however, but I do not like it’s presence. <em>Is it friendly…tortured? Waiting for something?</em> I strain my neck and back, standing on toes, trying to see past it’s shoulder without leaving the doorway but my attention was soon grasped by the vibrating object in my pocket, as well as the voice of the Orokin spewing from it.

“Hey hey Inari y-AHHHHHHHHHH”

My words were cut short as my left hand suddently flared with heat, making me drop the glass shard that I was holding, my eyes shutting in pain. I look down at the back of my palm only to see that a symbol has started to etch in to it, burning through the glove of my already trashed suit. Like it, my temper also ignited. <em>No like NO LIKE!</em>

I turn on my heels, flinging the speaker from my hand against a wall in clear fury, not caring for it anymore. The body in the hallway I saw seconds ago already drowned by the red river that quickly overtake my mind. I push past Inari, crouch down in front of the Orokin and grab him by the throat with my right hand, pulling his face inches from my mask, my eyes swirling like molten emeralds dipped in sunset. 

“What you do?! What is this?!” I demand through my clenched teeth with a voice that cracked like thunder, a voice that sounded more like it came from a furious bear than a petite girl. I lift my marked hand so that he can see what I was talking about.</span>

Of all the things that could have been in that elevator, this had to be the one thing she wasn&#39;t expecting. 
{A WHAT?} she exclaimed to Svtoj through text. Barely missing a beat, the MOA trotted towards the elevator, its gait more than a little uneven from the damage it took earlier. Arriving at the door, she flashed another message to the Cephalon within the frame. {CAN&#39;T YOU GET THIS DOOR OPEN?} All the while, she tried to get a look through the door, trying to see if she could catch a glimpse of this child. With a small amount of stretching, she managed to get a quick look at them. No obvious signs of physical trauma from what she could see, and seemed to be conscious, if terrified. While things in this blasted station were rarely what they seemed at first glance, she decided she couldn&#39;t just leave this poor child here. Something about its small, huddled frame struck a far too familiar chord with her.  Against her better judgement, she decided to speak with it.

&quot;<em>Ahem</em> Hello? Are you alright? Can you hear me?&quot;</span>

“H--HELLO? WH-WHO ARE YOU??” the child awkwardly yelled in a voice just barely tinged by puberty. With eyes bulging out of their sockets, he was physically shivering in terror. His fingers gripped the console inside the elevator with white knuckles as he hid behind it like it was the only thing left in the world protecting him.

Now closer, Aurelia saw that the child was dressed in a sleek Corpus tunic usually associated with bed-wear.</span>

In a moment, the towering Frame was standing up once more. It was a slow process, but there he was. Standing, fully conscious... Yeah, it felt nice. He stretched a little bit, almost instinctively reloaded his shotgun, and glanced around. Okay, he had clearly missed <em>something</em>, and- Wait, was there a kid shouting? No, no.

&quot;Voiddamnit Kamos-&quot; he started, but he was interrupted by Svy&#39;s message. He hardly even paid attention to Kamos returning to his frame, as he was already hurrying towards the elevator. &quot;Just- like, don&#39;t go smashing into walls, okay? I don&#39;t wanna carry you out of here.&quot;

With that, he turned his full attention to the small gap in the elevator, trying to peer in for his own glimpse of the kid. He couldn&#39;t see much, so he reached his arm in as far as he could and waved it in an attempt to show he wasn&#39;t a threat.
&quot;Hey bud!&quot; he called, pulling his arm back before the door decided to close on him, &quot;My name&#39;s Leveret! We&#39;re all friends here, no worries. Need some help?&quot;</span>

With all the commotion, Chegar took the opportunity to slip back into transference, his Vauban slowly lifting from its knelt position on the ground. Svytoj followed suite, letting leveret take the lead with the kid as he marched back over to Chegar and Kamo.
“The is becoming more of a mess with each minute.” Svytoj grumbled, keeping equal focus on Chegar and Kamos.
“Finding a child here is unsettling, but I don’t think it’s any cause for alarm.” Chegar replied.
“See, that’s the thing; Is the kid IN on all this? Did this RU group kidnap a child for this? And that’s not going into whether they’ve been exposed to the void, or some other agent.”
Chegar went quite for a moment, before finally beginning to fill Kamos in.
“So far, the invisible ball of razors we were fighting is dead, two of the team are...fixated on something in the middle of the same room-“
“And now we have a kid that could very well be the next thing we have to contain or kill.” Svytoj interrupted, keeping his voice as quiet as he could as not to let He child overhear; assuming they even needed to hear him to know what he was saying.</span>

Before she can even say anything, Inari stumbled back screaming in pain as her left hand burned like it was holding a bright hot coal pulled fresh from the fire. Falling onto her back, the tall tenno kicked out with her legs, more like an animal in pain then with any true purpose, her right hand gripping on her left wrist as salty tears filled her eyes. 

&quot;what the hell...&#39;&#39; 

She hissed through her teeth looking up over her operator suit at the grinning Orokin, holding up her left hand as it still shook from the pain, &quot;what the hell is this??&#39;&#39; she hissed again trying to see him clearly but seeing his vision slightly blur due to the tears.</span>

“e--” The speaker broke in two along its underside crease, dumping its contents onto the floor. It sure wasn’t getting up again.

“H e h e…” The Orokin only continued to smile and laugh, his voice now returning to him. The light of Inari and Sonera’s marks faded away, disappearing from the outside of the suit but still remaining engraved onto their skin. “Oh pardon me. I’ve just given you the power to survive—at a price of course. Since I’m stuck in here, I will have you clean up my mess for me.”

A soul-wrenching roar shook the hall on top of stairs, flinging tiny bits of debris down the steps. The heavy noises slithering drew closer… and closer. As it did, the subtle burning of the flames around them seemed to grow louder.

“Not that you have much of a choice!” he added.</span>

“A-ARE YOU GUYS WITH MY DAD?” he asked, not calmed down yet.</span>

My brows wrinkle under my mask, unhappy with the fact that I’m being toyed with like a little kid who has no choice but to kindly obey <em>Hate hate!</em>

However the banging and eerie roar spilling from the hallway made the hair on the back of my neck stand up like a unconscious reaction, springing my attention from the Orokin towards the doorway, my gaze flickering between the growing fire and Inari, listening to the symphony of horror bellowing from outside <em>It comes? Ah…short on time here</em>

I return my eyes back at the Orokin as he spit his last words, words that felt like someone puked on my face, making me grimace in disgust. It’s so un-fun when they tell you that you get no room to chose or act to your own thoughts, so boring when things are linear and expected of you out of some equally boring cosmic law <em>No fun no fun</em>…such a thing always rubs me the wrong way! Especially when they mistake my cheer as a form of weakness <em>No choice?! He means no freedom…we see we see</em>

A devilish grin started to spread across my lips, one corner cracking to expose my wolfish fang. “We see we see” I repeat my though out loud and let go of the Orokin’s throat, pointing at this missing arm

“Tell tell, is harm true here?”

I calmly ask him like it’s the most normal thing right now, not phased by the approaching doom as I stay crouched in front of the Orokin, my back turned towards the doorway as if it’s just him and me in the room in this moment.</span>

She wanted to spit in the arrogant bastards face, she wanted to tell him to go take a hike into the void and disappear, but the sound of the roar turned her attention toward the hallway as Sonera started asking the Orokin questions. Inari grinded her teeth feeling sweat break out as this situation had gone from weird to bad and possible worse than bad very very quickly.

Hearing Sonera&#39;s question she looked back at the smirking Orokin doubling on Sonera&#39;s question, &quot;along with that what the hell is this mess you want us to clean up&quot; Another roar made her look back real quick before she turned her eyes back with a very cold look, &quot;and you best speak quick, or i&#39;m not gonna hesitate to leave you to whatever the hell that is, sa sa ke?&#39;</span>

“The mess isn’t here, Tenno,” the Orokin spat, his smile dropping into an expression of disgust at the thought of it. “It’s already out <em>there</em>. This is only a picture of somewhere else.”

He spared a semi-anxious glance up the stairs before turning to Sonera with a renewed grin. “And I’m not sure. How about you and I find out?”

Sonera and Inari’s marks suddenly lit up once again. Then all at once, a gigantic column of flame burst into the room… and somehow suspended itself in place mid air. It almost looked frozen in place, until it bent over and <em>looked</em> at the group with blazing white eyes. Only when it opened its maw in preparation did it finally resemble a snake.</span>

The frost&#39;s heavy fingers stayed resting on the edge of the lower door as he tried to peer into the elevator.
&quot;I&#39;m not, but we can help you find him! Hold tight, we&#39;ll get you out of there safe and sound.&quot;

He glanced over his shoulder to the rest of the group gathering around the elevator. &quot;Anybody see an access panel around? I can fiddle around with the wires.&quot;</span>

One of my brows shot up in confusion as the Orokin said that this place is just a picture <em>I suppose but…a memory? A instance? A mirage? What is it?!</em> I pondered for a moment before the glow from my hand made me dip my gaze to it, my other brow shooting up to meet the first one. I didn’t even get to ask him what’s happening as the rush of fire made me snap my head towards the pillar, my jaw dropping in pure astonishment as it took the shape of a burning snake.

I look back at the Orokin, then at the snake, and back at the Orokin, my mouth shutting and my eyes adapting a <em>Are you fricking serious right now???</em> stare. What do I even do? Pet it? Fight it? With what? This mark?

I let out a sigh and stand up, whipping around to face the flaming snake. I mean…fire doesn’t hurt me here…at least the one that surrounds me, don’t know if this one is any different but as the Oroking said <em>Let’s see</em>

“Inari…if I die, you can have last piece of Frostleaf chocolate I carry on him - Wukong, don&#39;t forget or it melt and he gets sticky!”

Sucking in a breath of air, I let out a valiant war cry “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” and charge at it for a full frontal body smack, hands flailing above my head…the strategy here? HECK IF I KNOW! But something will happen, either it will burn me to a crisp or I&#39;ll pass through it or…well…let’s just hope something ELSE happens.</span>

~As Leveret’s fingers prodded around the door, he discovered it was jammed somehow. Its slight tilt implied the doors were crooked, causing them to wedge in opposite corners. It appeared physically stuck. Aurelia spotted a console mounted to the side of the elevator; It only had one button to call the elevator down to its floor.~

The kid stood up shakily. Leveret’s words seemed to have a positive effect as the child loosened up his posture, though he kept his position. “O-okay…”</span>

The frost glanced back over his shoulder at Aurelia and Chegar. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, don&#39;t worry, I got this.&quot;

He peered back through the crack. &quot;Okay so it looks like the doors are jammed. We&#39;re gonna find a way to get it open, but until then, don&#39;t get too close to the doors alright? They might get unstuck really suddenly.&quot;

&quot;Hey, kid, you got a name?&quot; he asked, trying to keep him occupied. He glanced around for a way to widen the hole without risking the doors slamming shut.</span>

Hearing the orokin say where they were was only a picture  of somewhere else,  wait we in a recording? a memory of some place?. Her thoughts ran in tandem with Sonera&#39;s not realizing both of them were trying to rack their brains over the bastards cryptic message. The burning sensation returned to her left hand as she looked down seeing the red mark burning, &#39;great now what...&#39; the taller tenno said as the heat of the flame snake bore down upon her back.

Turning to seeing the mass creature she took a few steps back, bringing up her right hand, she felt the mechanics of her amp forming around her gloved hand as she took aim at the giant creature, watching her smaller tenno counterpart running at it with an almost berserk like fury.</span>

The serpent looked poised to strike, but flinched when both of their marks started glowing. Then Sonera <em>charged headfirst into it</em>. For a brief second, intense heat descended upon her body, inflicting scorching burn marks on her exposed face. Then the creature freaked out from the sudden movement and recoiled to the other side of the room. <em>HSSSSSSSSSSSS.</em> It tried to look as threatening as possible while still keeping its distance, almost as if it was second-guessing itself.

“Wow Tenno,” the Orokin commented, “I was told you knew no fear, but I never imagined that!” He regarded the menacing viper with a little anxiety, “We used this place to save ourselves—so I am most likely sealed in it—but you could still escape. Provided you haven’t grown tired of living.”</span>

Seeing the serpent recoil at Sonera&#39;s berserk style attack method, she fired a stream of void enerfy her amp though not quite sure if in the space, their void powers would have any effect on the creature or their surroundings. Hearing the Orokin&#39;s words, the taller tenno shifted her head slightly keeping her main foucs on the beast, but putting the crippled orokin into her peripheral vision, &#39;make sense Orokin&#39; she said firmly, &#39;what is this place, and how in the void do we get back to where we were before?&#39;</span>

Taking a cursory look at the  control switch on the wall told Aurelia it wouldn&#39;t really prove helpful in opening this thing. And so far, Leveret&#39;s attempts at opening the elevator hadn&#39;t yielded any significant results. That said, it did seem like the door did seem to be open, but was unable to. Perhaps if another Tenno or two lend their strength?

&quot;Syvtoj, Chegar, would you try to help Leveret with that door? I&#39;m not sure if anything beyond brute force will get this open at this rate.&quot; Realizing that the sight of three Tenno trying to pull a door open with all their strength might be terrifying to an already rattled child. Approaching the door once again, she called to the child within.  &quot;Skee, was it? try to stand away from the door, we&#39;ll try to get it open for you.&quot;</span>

“No worries.” Svytoj said, retrieving his synth scanner; Maybe he’d find an override.
“Chegar, come help out with this!” He called out.

But Chegar didn’t respond; from behind the eyes of his Vauban, Chegar simply stared at the artifact, and the two Tenno still entranced by it.</span>

Inari’s void powers worked fine, just not in the way she was expecting. Instead of her regular projectile, an explosive beam of dark-red energy poured forth from her hand with such surprising force that it blew her off-balance. The snake caught half-a-second of concentrated fire and lost a chunk of its body. It spat a sizzling hiss.

The Orokin’s eyebrows shot upwards. “Oh? Well that’s outright unfair isn’t it. Usually you need to empower a weapon with the mark, but I suppose that’s what happens when you already wield the power of the Void itself.”

He rubbed a temple with his still existent hand and answered Inari and Sonera’s questions, his posture now a little more relaxed. “I said what I did, not because I was keeping it brief, but because I’m not entirely certain. The story is quite complicated. The object I’m assuming you entered to get in here has similar vested interests as I. It was ordered to contain some of these things back in the original location before… this happened... but I do not understand what it’s trying to accomplish now. However, that’s of little importance. What’s important is transference. The cage uses some sort of transference to bring things inside it, though the details are rather fuzzy to us. I don’t know precisely how you can escape, but since you Tenno live and breath transference, I’m certain you can discover the answer on your own.”

He shot a ludicrous guffaw at Sonera. “And I don’t know what you’re talking about. This fiend is trapped inside here too, and it’s obviously not black.”

Fear licked the fiery serpent’s blank eyes. They could see it. In panic, threw its tail across the room to swat both Tenno.</span>

“Okay I’m-- not going to move anyway…” Skee answered. The child was clearly showing signs of calming down now. He must’ve been tougher of a kid than he looked. 

Svytoj, on the other hand, had his scanner out. He found the standard composition of ferrite in the elevator doors. He could scan them. And that was about it.

The octahedron shimmered with power in front of Chegar’s face. It slowly dimmed and brightened, like it was beckoning him to relinquish a finger to its mysterious surface.

Something sounded above Kamos. It was too quick and faint to make out, but it could definitely attract his attention. The problem lay in there not being anything above him but the ceiling.</span>

&quot;Skee eh? How old are you?&quot; the Frost asked, still trying to keep the child occupied. 
&quot;Right, so what I&#39;m thinking is we get it open just enough to get the kid through,  then hold the doors open while he climbs out. No luck on the access panel, then?&quot;

Leveret stepped to one side to leave room for another frame to assist. &quot;Guess we just gotta open it the old fashioned way.&quot;</span>

He looked up in an instant, tensing up and reaching for a weapon. His pistol was soon pointed up at a ceiling, seeing as he was taking precisely no risks at this point. After the stabbing invisible thingy, he was gonna kill stuff before it killed him. For real, this time. He stared directly up, never so much as flinching or looking elsewhere. Strange noises? In a place like this? That needed his undivided attention. At least- he was mostly sure it did.</span>

“Scanner ain’t finding any wires, and I’m not seeing the hitch in the door.”The Frost replied, putting away the scanner. “Old fashion it is.” With that, Svytoj moved into place next to leveret.

<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
Chegar’s hand loomed over the artifact, just inches from contact. But then he looked at Sonera, and move his hand over towards the back of their head.
{if this goes wrong, take a running start, and kick me out of the way.}
The text crawled over the squads HUD. 
With that, Chegar placed the palm of his hand on the back of Sonera’s head.</span>

Stammering back into the field, the sheer force of her void energy wasn&#39;t what she was use to for certain as she saw a huge chunk of the fire beast dissolve under her void fire. &quot;sabaka! what the hell was that about...?&quot; 

Not being able to finish her thought as she noticed  the giant tail sweep across to hit her and Sonera, the large tenno scrambled back as fast as she could feeling the seering heat of the fire serpents tail feeling it pass over her suit.

I tilt my head to the side, confused by his confusion regarding the dark shadow I saw in the hallway before my emotions got the better of me. <em>Did I see wrong? Was it a illusion cast by the creature? The real thing?!</em>

“SONERA MOVE YOUR ASS!”

Oh right…the snake. I quickl crouch down just in time to feel the searing heat swing above my head. <em>Whoa…almost</em> I quickly get up and jump backwards, so that I’m as far away from the serpent as I can get in the room. “Give me time” I huff out to Inari, nodding my head to her.

Not wasting anymore time I cross my legs bellow me and stit on top of them, bringing my hands to rest in my lap. <em>Transference…</em> I close my eyes and concentrate on myself, my always noisy mind quiting down, searching for a flash in the darkness, for the nostalgic emotion that I feel whenever I jump in to <em>him</em>…maybe I can’t zip to him, but maybe I can latch on to something in here…something to control or something that attracts. I focus my energy, spilling it down my spine, letting it flow around me and to the mark on my hand, amplifying my search for something that feels familiar.</span>

The sixth sense of transference Sonera had grown so accustomed to wove spiderwebs of invisible energy through a transdimensional space. It felt as if an anchor that had been subtly weighing down her mind just release her. She sensed a thin strand of something she could interact with: and it was very close. In fact, amidst a sea of black, her only option pointed towards the mysterious object she had been carrying.

Inari saw the snake wriggle its head violently and plunge over the railing. Its ethereal fires slipped into the hallway below where the two Tenno recently came out of. The Orokin sharply yelped as the tip of its tail caught him and scorched a small portion of his good arm.</span>

While the others were working at the door,  Aurelia made sure to take a few steps away, as this kind of physical labor was unsuited to her current proxy. In doing so, however, it occurred to her that a certain absent Tenno actually would have been rather helpful in this situation. Where <em>was</em> that Rhino anyway? Remembering that Leveret was the last person to be with him, Aurelia tried to get the Frost&#39;s attention.

“Twelve,” Skee chirped. The doors angrily protested with screeches at the warframes’ efforts to force it open. Their technocytic muscles bulged in full as the scrap metal made smaller and smaller increments of progress towards opening. <em>SHINK.</em> All at once, the doors’ previous resistance evaporated and the doors flung open, unbalancing the two. 

Chegar’s hand touched Inari’s cold sword-steel chassis. Whether fortunately, unfortunately, or even frustratingly, nothing happened. The warframe’s head felt stiff, like it was undergoing rigor mortis.

Kamos heard rain. Or, perhaps it sounded more like an artificial replication of rain with the clacking of small, sharp objects. It trickled down from somewhere up in the ceiling, to down in the walls, to underneath the floor until it was surrounding him in a terrifying cascade of ambience. Only a few moments were given to react.</span>

Huh…I totally forgot about  this little thing. Still keeping my eyes clossed and my mind empty I dig in to my pocket to pull out the red gem-like object. I keep it in my opened palm and now focus on it…maybe I can open it if I breach it with enough energy? Or should I even do that? I pondered for a second but shook it off, if I can’t force it to open and let us out then at least I can make it spill some of it’s secrets.</span>

Oh, well then. Surrounded by that noise, what else could he do? What Kamos did best, of course. He felt surrounded, he was already on-edge after what happened before... That was not a recipe for a calm and collected Kamos. He growled, tightened his hold on his pistol... He had a plan, of course. Well, if by plan, you mean indiscriminate destruction in hopes that he breaks something important... All at once, he let out a mighty roar, stomped his foot into the ground below him with all of the force he could muster, and <em>hoped</em> he could be useful. At least once today, he wanted to blow something up and actually... well, be a use to this team. So, that&#39;s what he did.</span>

Chegar finally exhaled.
{“well, I’ve learned that touching them doesn’t cause you to go into a trance. so we can pull them off if we want to.”}

Stumbling back from the door coming unstuck, Svytoj righted himself just in time to keep from falling.
“{You really touched them!? After we agreed not to!?}”

“{someone had to check. But now we know.}”  the Vauban replied, migrating to the door separating the room from the hall. “{Which brings us to this; do we send someone in to check on them.}”</span>

Leveret was forced to pause his chat with Skee as the doors gave way. He kept his grip on them in case they started to close again, adjusting his position to leave room for the child. &quot;Alrighty, there we go. Come on now, out you get,&quot; he said encouragingly, sparing one hand from the door to coax the kid out of the elevator. 

At this point, Leveret was entirely focused on rescuing this young corpus boy. His instinct to protect was in full swing, and it was clear he was in his element.</span>

Apparently Leveret was too preoccupied with this child to answer a simple question. No matter, she&#39;d just go and check on Kamos herself then.  The MOA briskly turned on its heel and marched out the door again, heading back towards the assumedly still comatose pair of Tenno and hopefully Kamos.</span>

“Ah... yeah!” Skee proudly exclaimed, his face lighting up, “that’s why I was the hero to go find help for the others!” He carefully walked forward and placed his small hand onto Leveret’s large fingers, much better for wear.

Then squeezed when a loud <em>thump</em> reverberated through the halls.

A thick hurricane of deadly metal shards exploded from the covered vent system above Kamos’s head. His powerful stomp punched a rectangular dent into the floor, catching the wicked storm mere milliseconds away from his technocyte flesh. Walls shuddered and ferrite groaned. 

Kamos looked up to a sky of magically suspended scrap.</span>

~Sonera stared into the object… and found something staring back. It felt like it had hollow eyes, an empty mind, and no expression. Was it an illusion, or was something there? Sonera felt her skin crawl like millions of tiny insects by just sensing it. Yet in all that mystery, there was promise. In its metaphysical lap sat a ball of loose transference strings, one of which felt very familiar.~</span>

All she could do was wait as Sonera delved into the object trying to pry something from it, turning back toward the Orokin, lifting his arm she checked the burn marks seeing if there was any critical harm, &#39;well you&#39;ll be fine, as far as i can see&#39; she said bluntly.

Sitting in front of him , the tenno could feel the grass pushing against her suit as she tried to lever her eyes with his, for even though she was taller than most tenno it still felt like this Orokin still towered over her. &quot;well then, while She is playing with that object, you mind telling me what in the nine hells happened here?&quot; lifting her left hand while ending the first part of the inquiry she twisted to show the top of her hand and the red mark now brightly lit on it, &#39;and what the void is this you so eagerly placed on the both of us?&#39;</span>

WAIT

Is that…

YES!

Woah. Now <em>that</em> was close. He looked at all of these shards suspended in the air, more than a bit confused. He grunted, rather awkwardly took a step back, getting clear of them. Just as a precaution, he did cover himself in a layer of iron skin, but... frankly, he was just confused. What was that? Where had it come from? Huh... He sort of poked one of the shards, trying to see just <em>how</em> sharp these things were. Did he say something? Did he leave the room? Frankly... he had no idea.</span>

The thump that resounded through the hall jolted Aurelia to attention, causing her to quicken her strides towards where they had left Kamos mere minutes ago. As she rounded the corner and came to the doorway, she could only see the Rhino standing there with dozens of pieces of metal scrap suspended in the air around him. 

&quot;Rhino! What happened? are the others alright?&quot; she asked alarmedly. She looked around, trying to see if Sonera and Inari were still standing nearby.</span>

As Inari showed the Orokin her mark, its light faded out again. He regarded her with sleepless eyes.

“I’m not surprised you don’t know what happened here. Nobody probably would. Nobody alive, anyway. It’s not a thing you <em>should</em> know, and not a thing I will divulge to you completely. You can see enough of it already. Welcome to Ineptia, or Isle-6 if you prefer. Not that there were 5 others.”

He cupped his shoulder. “Here were monsters. Some caught, most bred. All for a variety of purposes. We even treated them rather well here, yet it wasn’t enough. Once they squeezed out a millimeter through our security, they took a metaphorical lunar distance. Razed this place to the ground.”

The Orokin leaned forward a little, making careful eye contact with the tall Tenno. “And next they shall do it to you, unless you use that mark,” he pointed to the back of her hand, “it’s one of our last and most powerful of resorts. It didn’t help us much, but you… I can already tell things are going to be different with you. It merely grants you the power to deny absurdity. I can&#39;t tell you how it works because I am not entirely sure myself.”

He let himself fall backwards again. “Listen, even by the Seven’s standards this was a risky idea. We truly were doomed from the start. Everyone’s sacrifice, my punishment. No cost too great I suppose--”

He froze for a moment, then shook his head. “But now you’ve got me rambling. Sly. Although I can’t mind at this point after being here for so long. Since you’ve got me talking, let me ask something of you.”

“How goes the War?”

~Sonera felt like she was crawling through ooze beneath the gaze of a merciless power. It much resembled the feelings of an ant beneath a cruel and hungry kondroc. A faceless god loomed over her, watching. An extreme sense of fear racked her mind as she found the end of the thread pointing to a hole.~</span>

Skee shivered as Leveret’s bubble of frost dropped the temperature around them. He clung tightly to the Frost’s chassis as if the sword-steel would warm him up.

The shard Kamos touched was indeed sharp. It had been filed down to quite the razor edge. All of them had. After Kamos took a step back, the shards began to slowly move again. At first it seemed random, then all the shard clustered together in a column and reached for the floor. The stomp was about to wear off.</span>

<em>Ah…this would be good on a relaxing mud bath…IF THE PERVERT WASN’T WATCHING</em> I thought while I crawled forward, choosing to ignore the presence looming over me.

Learning how to get out?

<em>BAH</em> I shake my head as I reach the pit, looming just at it’s edge as the urge to look over my shoulder started to rise. <em>No no, find him!</em> I clench my teeth and follow the threat with a swift hop, like Alice jumping down the rabbit hole. I feel him, he will not lie to me</span>

Well, this was... strange. Very strange. He stared at the shards, as they continued to make their way down to wherever they were going. Or wherever gravity was taking them. Yeah, probably gravity. That sounded right. Still, he backed up slightly. Who know what they might do when the stomp wears off?

&quot;Ceiling tried to kill me. I beat it.&quot; Kamos mumbled, gesturing to all of the shards before him. What was the Cephalon doing here, then? Wasn&#39;t there an elevator to be worrying about? Hmmm, maybe he should actually bother asking about that. Eh, soon. &quot;This place keeps trying to kill me. <em>Really</em> starting to get annoying.&quot;</span>

It wasn&#39;t the ridiculousness of his explanation that brought pause to the tenno, or the thought that this orokin scientist didn&#39;t seemed that phased at the fact everyone he had worked with in this, &quot;other place&quot; has been slaughtered to what had become a zoo of abominations and monsters. 

It was the last question that darkened her expression rather quickly, how long has he been here, she wondered, how much time passes here compared to the outside world. 

&quot;What&#39;s the last thing you remember of the war?&quot; she asked sullenly, her stance going a little defensive not knowing what his reaction is going to be at the grave news she would be delivering at the end.</span>

“Maybe I should hang around you more; might actually get to do something excitin’.” Svytoj said to Kamos, obvious snark and a slight chuckle in his voice. “So now we have a violent ceiling, some kid in the elevator...”
“And now we know we can touch those touching the orb without being affected by it.” Chegar interrupted, eye now fixed on the column of shards suspended before the group. Chegar readied a bastille, just in case.

The Orokin averted his eyes for a moment and cleared his throat. “It’s been that long, huh. Allow me a moment to think… the last report we received detailed that the Sentients had been mostly pushed back to Neptune, Sedna, and Pluto. I can’t recall anything specific as our location was isolated, other than confidential information.”

He absentmindedly ran a hand through his grey-blue hair. “Judging by your timely appearance, we can’t be losing too badly now, can we?”</span>

Sonera held the octahedron in her palm with Inari’s warframe still attached to it. Her vision fish-eyed for a moment, then she found herself flung onto the floor. The mysterious object was no longer in her Wukong hands, but stuck to the underside of Inari’s like it was glued on. She made it. She was out.

The shards collected on the ground in a tight bundle. They started vibrating, slowly at first. Two seconds later the movement was quite noticeable.

Then they exploded.

<em><strong>KRACKOOM!</strong></em>  Dozens of razor-sharp shards flew through the air, scraping ferrite and damaging Tenno in their wake. Since he was the closest, a lot of the shards reflected off Kamos’s hardened skin, shredding most of the protective barrier off his front. Two of them even punched right into his gut and drew technocytic blood. The force of the impact threw him backwards.

Chegar’s warframe became a pin-cushion before anyone could blink. Almost fifteen shards caught him in the chest, arms, and legs. One deadly one embedded itself into his neck, forcing him to take extremely laboured breaths to scramble for oxygen. If it wasn&#39;t for Kamos taking most of the shots, it might&#39;ve been even worse.

Aurelia miraculously avoided lethal damage, but took a few projectiles to the right leg, causing the rotary joints to malfunction. It could still be moved, just not bent.  

At the same time as all of this, a thick smoke poured from the vent like a waterfall. All the group’s vision failed to pierce the encroaching veil.</span>

Good thing his first response to nearly everything was either Iron Skin, or just hitting the thing really hard. In this case, both helped him out- No, wait. That one hit something important. Oof, ow, ouch. Nearly immediately after the shards exploded outward and made short work of his defenses, Kamos grunted in pain. Then, with yet <em>another</em> roar (Kamos is a very loud person), he reached for both shards and tried to rip them out of him. This was hardly a good time to be bleeding. But, at least he managed to be helpful here, right? Probably blocked a bunch.  Should he turn around and see if anyone else was hurt? Nah, he should stay here in case anymore pointy things come out. He could talk later, anyway.</span>

Chegar’s ‘frame lurched, stumbling back into the room from which he came, gurgling.

“...not...g-ood...” the frame collapsed as Chegar transpired from it. He pressed his hand to the segment with the shard, letting the void energy pulls through it while he removed the shard.

“{EVERYONE SOUND OFF! WHO’S HURT?!}” He called out over the COMMS.

“{I think I have one lodge in my forehead, but I can’t tell.}” Svytoj replied.  The Frost continues to watch the smoke billow down, slowly backing away all the while.</span>

“Ow Jeez!” I let out with a huff as I suddenly met the hard floor with my back, knocking the wind out of my lungs. “Ah…am I…” I blink to stabilize my vision from this blurry haze that followed me while I was inside the thing. Dipping my gaze down to my hands I see that these are not my own but HIS! <em>A-AH! I’m back to him! Yes yes!</em> However, I wasn’t given much time to celebrate the reunion as my senses finally took notice of the familiar blaring sirens and danger signs lighting up my HUD.

<em>Ah snap</em> I quickly push myself off the floor and on to my feet, my fists raised to face this danger…but…there is nothing in the room, apart from me and the frozen Mirage that still held on to the object. I relax my posture, my hands dropping, my ears still ringing with the alerts from my Cephalon that’s probably been ringing since I touched that blasted thing “Adus! I’m back, I’m fine! Relax!”

<strong>Adus (Dresden)</strong>
The Cephalon took a pause, probably stabilizing from that little panic attack like a lost child when it hears it&#39;s parents voice

<strong>Sonera</strong>
I let out a sigh and squeeze the bridge of my nose “So…what happening? Where are…” I pause my sentence as I faintly hear banging in the hallway. I walk to the doorway and poke my head out, only to see constant darkness that not even the light from my warframe could illuminate. I see nothing from this part here. I look over my shoulder to Inari and walk over to stand in front of her frozen frame <em>Is she fine? Does she need help?</em> I pondered for a moment as my right hand slowly inched towards the object

The unexpected shout made me jump in my skin, my hand freezing just before it touched the object. Is that Chegar? I blinked and quickly replied through the comms

“Ah-ah! Yes yes! I’m fine! I’m back! Where you? What happening?”

I whip around to look at the doorway but not leaving Inari just yet…maybe she was right behind me…or still fighting?</span>

Something heavy crashed through the solid cover of the vent and slammed into the hallway floor. The smoke engulfed Kamos in his current position and kept extending outwards as two very faint red lights pierced through the veil.

Two long, low scrapes sounded off from inside the cloud. They sounded familiar. They sounded like the scraping the group had been hearing in the very beginning. It wasn’t easy to notice the difference in the beginning, but this was very distinct.</span>

“{and I’m... still holding the shard...}” The discomfort in his voice palpable.

“{whatever you do, doesn’t let go of that shard, kid.}” Svytoj said. “{Everyone else, fall back under the globe!}” He called out, moving back toward and into Leveret’s globe. Scanner in one hand, Soma in the other, Svytoj waited.</span>

&quot;I&#39;m alive. But-&quot; More... things, happening. Now, what would anyone expect Kamos to do right now? Not retreat. That was for sure. No, he was gonna stand his ground. Sure, he was bleeding, but has that <em>ever</em> stopped Kamos before? No. No, it hasn&#39;t. At least, if that lung thing earlier was any indication. 

So, Kamos stood his ground there as the smoke surrounded him. He tensed up, just bracing himself for whatever was coming. In case he either had to fend it off, or beat the everything out of it. Maybe, finally, it&#39;d be the latter. He felt so useless today, he had to do something or other.</span>

Huh? What? Chegar’s answer confused me even more, my desire to leap out of the room and assist them growing. But I stop and look at the Mirage. <em>Ahhhhhhh</em> I huffed and dug out of my pocket three little balls which I throw around the Mirage in points of a triangle. The balls upon touching the floor manifested in to specters. A Ancient Healer Eximus with purple feathers glued on to it’s grabbing arm, a Moa Eximus that is smeared across the muzzle with orange lipstick and a Lancer Eximus who carries a paper crown on his head.

I smile, and nod my head to them as I fix their positions to keep watch over the Mirage “No bickering” I say to them before jumping and disolving in to my cloud form, quickly whizzing out the corridor and heading towards  the group</span>

The two lights pounced with incredible speed. A figure emerged from the cloud, streaming black smoke from its arms and legs. Kamos couldn’t see it well in the light, but it was obviously humanoid with large, cylindrical forearms and shins.

In a split-second, it landed a foot on the Rhino’s chest. Normally warframes are quite heavy, and one of the sturdiest of them all should be no exception. That’s why it was very surprising for Kamos to find himself launched backwards like a ragdoll with such force that he dented the wall he ricocheted off. By the time he could get himself together, the newcomer was already veiled in the smoke again.

<strong>Skee:</strong>
&quot;O-okay,&quot; Skee replied, voice muffled from being tucked into Leveret&#39;s chassis. The child&#39;s eyes went wide as if he had just remembered something important. &quot;o-OH! There&#39;s someone upstairs walking around outside the room the others are still in. I think he&#39;s evil. I sneaked past him but he might be still there! Can you guys go back up and save my friends?&quot;</span>

The Orokin’s eyes went as wide as dinner plates. “What..?” he gawked, chest heaving slowly. &quot;Then… no… you mean that the Sentients entirely won? That they exterminated the human race and are now in control of the Origin system? How!?&quot;

As he spoke, Sonera blipped out of existence behind Inari, dropping the object to the ground.</span>

Look, there was one thing Kamos knew how to do in a situation like this. He slammed into the wall, immediately scrambling back to his feet. Whatever was there, was back in the smoke. But, maybe if he tried to go back in there and hit whatever that was <em>really</em> hard, he could win. Basically, his whole thought process. Was he right? Probably not. But he had to find out. So, he broke into a sprint, charging back across his room as fast as he could and beginning to swing his greatsword the moment he neared the smoke once more. Maybe he&#39;d hit something? Hopefully!</span>

Shit. He had planned on staying in the bubble with Skee, but...rescuing the people upstairs was also important.

Switching to comms again, Leveret made his decision. &quot;Svy, Chegar, Aurelia - kid says there&#39;s an evil guy upstairs and more people that need rescuing. I need you to either come with, or help watch the kid while I go up.&quot;

They hadn&#39;t responded the last few times he&#39;d tried to contact them over comms. He hoped they were alright.</span>

I quickly harden my body, pulling back from the windy form to drop down on my feet a ouple of paces in front of the Moa. “Miss me?!” I jokingly say with a smile before adding with a more serious tone “What happen?

As Sonera slid to a stop in front of Aurelia, a faint red light slowly filled the air around her, throwing harsh hues onto her chassis. Right in front of her face, the mysterious mark burned into existence once again, this time on the back of her Wukong&#39;s hand.

Kamos caught a vague glimpse of a silhouette inside the smoke dodging underneath his swing. The enemy failed to completely duck under the blade, so it scraped across its arms with a horrible metal-on-metal grating noise, throwing yellow sparks into the black shroud of smoke. 

Quick as a whip, it recovered and turned on Kamos with a punch to his exposed gut. It hit like a semi-truck, but lacked the blowback the first kick had. It knocked the wind out of Kamos’s warframe and staggered him for a moment. His foe took that opportunity to slam the back of his hand and pull on his sword in an attempt to disarm him.

Meanwhile, the smoke continued to envelop the hall.</span>

Inari sensed something when she touched the cube. It felt like an invisible current slowly winding through the air. It felt like transference energy. Transference energy in the shape of a groove through metaphysical space, as if a path had been dug out, leading into the infinite depths of the octahedron.</span>

What the...OH ITS AGAIN! ITS BACK!
I dip my head down to my right hand to see the mark appear again, my mask curling in to a devilish smile, like a gamer that unlocks a new power to play with <em>Wait...do I keep it? What&#39;s it mean? Can I...</em> I don&#39;t even let my thoughts end as I lift my hand towards the smoke. It had a effect on the snake, it called on to that creep...maybe it has power here too?

I squint my eyes and focus to blast that smoke with light or laser...whatever materializes first!</span>

The Frost was <em>very close</em> to cussing out Aurelia for her response. &quot;Last I checked, protecting civilians is also our job, but alright,&quot; he huffed.

After a moment to compose himself, he spoke again into the comms, &quot;Alright Svy, meet me at the elevator and we&#39;ll head up,&quot; Leveret instructed, adjusting Skee&#39;s position on his hip.

The mildly pincushioned quickly followed behind Leveret. 
“Just make sure the kid doesn’t end up like me.” He quipped, jabbing a thumb towards a shard imbedded in his face.
<strong>CHEGAR</strong>
“{Okay. I think I have my frame  patched enough to resume transference.}”
With that, Chegar blinked out of existence, the Vauban snapped to life in a flurry of green sparks, its hand snapping outward to grab the shard Chegar had left behind.
Chegar stood up, and began to look around, taking stock of the situation at hand.</span>

So close, but he still missed. Somehow. He couldn&#39;t see a thing in this smoke, and- Oh, that one hurt. Kamos stumbled in the immediate aftermath of the punch, and in that whole mess, whatever he was fighting did indeed manage to get that sword. What was Kamos supposed to do now, then? Disarmed, surrounded by smoke, almost blind? The only other thing he could do, at a time like this.

At least Kamos was sort of close enough to tell <em>where</em> his opponent was, so there was that. Taking full advantage of this, the Rhino threw a punch back. With the intent to hit as hard as he physically could at this point, Kamos tried to land an uppercut on this thing&#39;s head. Maybe it&#39;d work, maybe it wouldn&#39;t. Time to find out.</span>

She absolutely did not agree with the plan of splitting up once again, especially with a very salient threat sitting right in front of them. In the meantime however, she simply did her best to stay out of the way of the fight, sending a message to Svytoj as she did.

Sonera&#39;s hand burned slightly brighter and shook back and forth, as if being rocked by invisible waves, and then…. nothing happened. She only found herself standing there with a hand miming something cool.

&quot;Uhn,&quot; Skee vocalized with a short nod. The child&#39;s face scrunched up into an adorable expression of confidence as he steeled himself for what lie ahead. He fastened his arms around Leveret&#39;s waist with as much strength as he could muster.

The enemy pulled away with the weapon in-hand. It lost a little of its balance to the sudden success since it was expecting more of a fight. <em>SCRUNCH.</em> Although the last part of his swing felt oddly pushed back as it barreled through the air, Kamos&#39;s fist made a solid connection his target&#39;s heavy metal chin. It fell over backwards, performed a small roll to recover, then immediately kicked off the wall with a loud <em>CLANG</em>. It launched itself through the air faster than slingshot extending a fist aimed directly at the Rhino&#39;s head.</span>

“{Good? I’m not even sure it’s sane.}” Svytoj replied; even over text his response seemed cavalier. “{never the less, we’re goin’ for it.}”
Chegar’s Vauban  limped back to the scene of his impalement, watching as Kamos and this entity du||ke it out amidst the fog and smoke. Near blind to the situation, Chegar did the only reasonable thing he could think of; he threw his nikana hilt-first towards Kamos.
“{Heads up!}” Chegar called out, readying his sobek, and unloading on the other form in the smoke.
“{Can I get some more covering fire!}” the COM lighting up with his request.
“{kinda busy here, kid.}”Svytoj replied, still marching towards the lift.
“{RESOLVE IT: I NEED AN ASSIST!}”
“Damn kids; always so pushy...” he muttered under his breath.
With that, Svytoj turned his attention back towards Leveret.

While relieved that a growing number of the squad was lending their firepower to their salient threat, she was still worried about whatever it was they were up against. This thing was taking direct hits from a Rhino seemingly without slowing, which in of itself was no meager feat. She couldn&#39;t really answer Chegar&#39;s call for extra firepower, but in the heat of the moment, an idea occurred. She looked around what parts of the hallway she could actually see, hoping to find a functional console of some kind. It was unfortunate that Lev seemed insistent on staying their course, but there was nothing she could do about that now.</span>

Oh, this stranger was in a <em>real</em> hand-to-hand fight with Kamos, now. Time to see how this was gonna go. That first punch did almost exactly what the Rhino had hoped, even if it hadn&#39;t done much more than stagger whoever or whatever this was. Now, there were plenty of ways Kamos could approach this. Many ways to just sorta break more stuff. But, of course, he settled on the most simple option. 

Kamos lunged forward, ducked very slightly, and went for another punch of his own. Aiming for the same place, again. Fists to the face did tend to work the best. It was the most direct way of doing things, anyway.</span>

A deep pout graced my mask as nothing seemed to jump out of my hand <em>Lame lame!</em> I lift my gaze up at the smoke, hearing the hussle and bussle going on inside. And just like that, my pout started to shift in to a devilish smile as the noise ignited this simple need, this basic desire that flooded over me like a unstoppable current. They’re fighting and I NEED to get in there!

I look down at my glowing hand “Yes yes!” I exclaim as realization hit me, remembering the Orokin words. I slap my hands together to create a greenish spark, this spark spread around my hands till it it started to take shape of a mighty staff made out of pure energy. I grab the staff with my marked hand and look over my shoulder to the Moa behind me “Toodles!” I laugh out before charging at the smoke, but before entering the cloud I leap upwards and helicopter-spin the staff in front of me as I fall down inside it from above…I mean…I’ll hit SOMETHING!
Or maybe even clear this damn smoke with the spin</span>

Leveret simply walked into the elevator in response. He took a finger and slid it up the cold surface of the console inside. The doors shuddered and slid shut inches in front of Svytoj’s face.

Halfway through its flight, the figure unnaturally halted mid-air, then slammed onto the ground. Kamos’s fist swiped through empty air. It was a feint. The Rhino’s opponent quickly spun around and landed one foot right on his ribcage. The maneuver didn’t look like it was strong, but it knocked the wind right out of his technocytic lungs and sent him sliding back a meter. The blows would probably be much more dangerous to a lighter warframe.

The enemy went to stand up again, but was staggered sideways when a blast from Chegar’s sobek ripped into its side, launching a spray of sparks and metal off him. It turned around quick enough to see Sonera leaping forward. The Wukong’s ethereal swipe moved enough air to pull apart the smoke cloud just enough to see her attack blocked by a set of bulky robot forearms. They seemed able to resist her staff, but not fully. The two parts sizzled on contact and pushed the foe back, before it did something to shoot itself backwards, falling out of reach.

The only console Aurelia could find that she hadn’t rifled through already was the one for the locked door right behind her. It was functional, but required authentication.</span>

“N--” a syllable escaped the Orokin’s mouth, and hung in the air for a couple seconds after as Inari was whisked away. She found herself in a black, empty void. The trail continued onward, and Inari could feel a kind of string in the middle of it. It led to a heap of disorderly strings that felt very much like transference signals.

&quot;It&#39;s metal metal! Robot!&quot; I yell out before charging, not giving this thing even a second to rest

The automaton tracked Sonera’s movement and launched a jab right as she came up to it, but barely missed when she crouched. It failed to regain its balance before her pole swept it off its feet. It fell onto its right arm.</span>

The darkness was almost calming to her, the feelings of transference energy was a bit of a mess but she kept her focus on the single line of energy in front of her, almost as if trailing her fingers along a chord of rope. Stepping forward she took a few internal breaths to calm herself, some of her thoughts lingering on the Orokin scientist she just left who may have been trying to stop her. 

Either way, she moved forward step by step, making sure not to let herself be lost in the vast inky darkness of the object and the mass jumbles of transference energy that drifted around her.</span>

Knocked back and staggered, the moment of vulnerability was thankfully not exploited by whatever this is. He probably had Sonera and Chegar to thank for that, honestly. But this was no time to be <em>thanking</em> people, of course. This thing still had his sword, <em>and</em> was generally being a pain. So, taking just a moment to regain his balance, Kamos thought of the best plan someone like him could make in such a short amount of time. Aaaand time to execute that plan. Kamos charged <em>yet again</em> (Hey, if it works...), with the plan being to slam whatever this thing was into a wall as hard as he could. The sword could probably wait a moment.</span>

~The enemy spun around to deliver a blow to the blitzing Rhino with its other arm, but failed. Kamos bulldozed right into it, launching it into the wall with full force. Its body bounced off with a sickening thud and rolled down the corridor. Trailing out of the smoke, its full visage was revealed.

Sonera was right. It <em>was</em> a robot. But nothing like they’d ever seen. Its model was humanoid, with disproportionately large metal cylinders for its forearms and shins which ear-gratingly scraped against the floor as it skid. They gave the impression that it was chained, although it was clearly a supportive design choice. The sharp, inverted triangular head atop it bore two rectangles for dim, red eye slits. The most familiar thing about it were the grooves of metal and streaks of blue strewn throughout its otherwise chrome-black chassis. That looked like Hyena tech.

The automaton got to its feet before it even stopped moving. Smoke began cascading out from the creases along its body, once merely a fashion choice now made functional. It was too impatient to wait for the cover to form, however. 

Its legs flashed a very subtle blue, then the robot shot up to the ceiling. It dented a vent cover and tossed it to the floor. The grate strangely shattered into way more shiny bits of ferrite than it normally should’ve, which spread themselves across the floor to create a glittering carpet. Finishing off the motion, it dropped down with a quiet crunch, eyeing the Tenno with an expressionless glare.~</span>

Unfortunately, there wasn&#39;t much available to her. The console she had already looked through didn&#39;t have any thing that she could use here, save some possible information on the current opponent. While not as abstract as their previous adversary, this one was certainly a force to be reckoned with.  At any rate, whether or not that console had information on it was beside the point now: it would be suicidal to try and access that terminal with that monster around. She didn&#39;t know what exactly it had just tried to do. It wasn&#39;t trying to escape, that much was clear, but was it really going to keep fighting?

As Inari swam amidst the comfort of the darkness, muffled sounds began rising to her mind. She could barely make them out to be low-pitched, unintelligible sentences. Her caution finally rewarding her, Inari grasped onto the end of the metaphorical transference rope. It vanished into a hole where Inari felt the presence something she could transfer into. It was familiar too. It was her warframe.

“m.”

A deafening syllable broke through in the form of a rush of wind, threatening to carry Inari off into the expansive black void beyond. Another hole whorled itself into existence to her right, this one not bearing any recognizable visage.</span>

I swiftly and soundlessly land on the floor as gravity pulled to me from my leap. My toes connecting with the ground first, my body following the pull without a hint of resistance to end in to a elegant crouch, my exalted staff held in my left hand behind my back, my right flat on the floor for added support.

I gaze at our enemy as they came in to full view, my head tilting to the side, my mask adorning a perplexed look, my black orbs trailing up and down it&#39;s body <em>What is? Looks like Hyena tech! But...more human? More - AH</em>
I jerk my head up as the machine leaped up to tear a vent grate off before smashing it on the floor in a thousand pieces <em>Weird...</em>

I smile and stand up on my feet, my stance wide, I gaze at Kamos and sharply yell out &quot;Kamos, STOMP&quot;
Not giving the machine any time to think I push myself from my position, and in two strides close the distance between me and the machine
HOWEVER
I do not attack
I suddently stop outside of the ferrite carpet and swing around my body like a graceful ice-skater who just landed a triple roll. I carry my staff around me as I do this spin, generating a gust of wind that I let loose with a vicious strike at the end of the spin, towards the machine.

Assuming Kamos did his thing, the gust of wind I&#39;ve just projected at the machine would send all the ferrite shards (that would be suspended in the air by the Stomp) flying towards it in what I hope would be a disorienting attack, able to give someone a opening to deliver a subduing hit.</span>

This time, it was in full view. Excellent. Kamos could handle this, right? Right. He crouched down, lifted the greatsword back up, and really just stared this thing down for a moment. Then, he heard someone yell about stomping. Sonera? Probably. Without even questioning it, because frankly Kamos would never question being told to break stuff, he did just that.

In an instant, he was standing up straight, lifting a leg, and then slamming it down with every bit of force he could muster. Yeah, it was a stomp. Kamos knew this whole fight (<em>including</em> the whole &#39;being stabbed by invisible thingies&#39; thing) had gone on for a while and he <em>might</em> not have too much left in him, but that&#39;s never stopped him in the past. So, he stomped. Satisfying, honestly, to damage this robot thing. It was a pain.</span>

Their enemy reached an arm out towards the shards on the floor, but Kamos’s stomp abruptly foiled what it had been about to do. With deadly force, the shards were successfully launched. The robot crossed its arms over-top of its torso and the projectiles struck true. It didn’t have the intended effect, however, as the shards seemed to change orientation just enough to deflect without many lethal hits on its appendages.

As soon as the attack was blocked, the robot swung an arm around with its hand open. The faint sound of a mechanical parts moving sounded from its forearm as the still airborne pieces of metal halted, then were pulled through the air into its hand. It looked Sonera right in the eyes through burning, red optics.

Then flexed its fingers, and launched another volley.

Shards screamed down the hall towards whoever was caught still in it.

“If you don’t mind me asking,” Deco broke the silence, yanking the battery from a well-worn Plinx someone handed him and running his fingers over it. “What would… <em>you</em> expect we find in there?”

Red slid three fingers down a navigation panel displaying a chart of their course to remote space. He looked out of the port-window with conviction… and something else. Fear. Not from an enemy, either. It was that fear he carried with him since the very second he signed up for his job.

“Can’t say for sure, doctor,” he responded, “I don’t have information you aren’t privy to--”

“Are you sure?” Deco interrupted, raising an eyebrow. It wasn’t phrased like a genuine question, but more like an accusation.

Red cleared his throat. He was wearing his usual narrow-eyed expression. Focused, with a hint of concern. “Let’s just say…” 

He swiped his thumb across a button embedded into the collar of his combat suit. The tech shifted around his face until a helmet had shaped itself to conceal it. “That if it’s something <em>they</em> can’t handle, these engines better be warm.”

Inari felt herself fall through a tube, compressed on all sides. It kept getting narrower and narrower until…

With a start, Inari toppled over onto the ground. In the blink of an eye, she was already back where she started, on the station. The room wasn’t any different, but she could hear the sounds of a fight coming from the hallway. She was still holding the very object that sent her into that rabbit hole. 

Except this time, it wasn’t glowing anymore.</span>

AHA! It wooooooooorked? I wrinkle my brows as the planned attack went without a hitch but the ferrite didn’t go where I wanted it to, instead pooling around it’s arms and legs. So it controls metal? Or just this material? I didn’t linger too long on the through as I noticed it glaring at me

<em>Huh…is it…mad at me?</em> I thought with a tilt of my head as I take notice of the way it’s red burning eyes gaze at me. But even that didn’t linger for too long as I saw it’s hands lifting and swinging.

“Oh nope!” I smirk and drop the staff from my hands, letting it dissolve in to void mist. Just before the projectiles hit and pierce me I jump up and cut  myself in to a cloud, letting the ferrite pass through me. With utmost speed and haste I dart towards him, hoping that his voodoo can’t touch me in my element. Once I reach him I will pull myself in to my solid form and use the momentum from the cloud for a fullbody tackle, smacking myself against him like a rabid runaway speeding truck meeting a solid wall in need of a hug <em>Brace brace BRAAAAAACE</em></span>

Shaking her head she looked around trying to get her surroundings, the sensation of the vortex and that deep sense of transference and that island was still fresh in her mind, the station....she was back at the station. Looking down the tenno realized she was no longer looking at her gloved hands, but the gauntles of her Mirage, she was back in ami. 
&quot;This is Inari, can anyone hear me?&quot; 

She said on the comms she hoped were still working,  looking around the area definitely didn&#39;t look like that last place she was with the rest of the group on the station. What on earth had happened since her and Sonera had gone to that mysterious place? 

Slowly getting to her feet, she felt around making sure all of her equipment was still secured to her frame before slowly walking down the hallway, hearing the sounds of battle, she drew her Cernos from it&#39;s holster on her back, knocking an arrow as to not be caught off guard by what was up ahead.</span>

Theoretically, Kamos could hear Inari, but has something like that ever caught his attention? No. Never. Which is exactly why he decided to just go ahead and attack that thing. He crouched down, finally picking his sword back up. He shouldn&#39;t have left it there on the floor for so long in the first place, but he was... well, other things took priority. Mostly breaking stuff. This, though, might call for something better than punching everything to death. Stabbing everything to death, now. Or slashing. Or still bludgeoning. Frankly, he just had to wait and see. 

Kamos was already closing in on the robot thing, by the time he saw Sonera doing the same. Well, that messed up his plan somewhat. No time to think, though. So, he just decided to hope for the best. Seizing his advantage, he charged his way into stabbing range. With every bit of effort he could muster at this point, Kamos stabbed the thing with the greatsword. He wasn&#39;t even aiming for anything specific, anymore. Just any real, actual damage to this thing would suffice.</span>

The two grappled each other’s elbows, locked in a contest of strength, to which the Wukong’s opponent seemed more than capable of dealing with. She could make out the sound of small engines revving up for a second, then the robot quickly snapped back one of its arms a small distance and punched it forward. 

However, Sonera wasn’t launched like the rest. The mark on her hand burned with fury, then pulsed a ripple of red energy coursing down her body in the blink of an eye. The symbol faded into a content blue, and Sonera found herself still fighting… for now. 

Kamos tanked the next volley of shards as they blew through Sonera’s misty form. His iron skin shed ribbons of energy, exposing even more weak spots until most of it had been carved away. Three sunk into his left arm, and a fourth hit him in the stomach again. Unfortunately for the caster, that was not enough to stop this mass of undying will, and he still made his attack.

Kamos beheld the all-too-familiar crunch of alloy plating. His sword took a chunk off the robot’s back, but was deflected to the side by the same mysterious force that had been plaguing him the entire battle.

Inari walked out in time to see the action just at the end of the hall.~</span>

Ah CRAP! I close my eyes waiting for the painful punch to send me flying knowing I don’t have enough time to wiggle out, but… <em>OOF</em> I feel it, it landed on my gut, but I’m not rolling away 10km per second? I open my eyes to find myself still wrestling with the robot, a energy of some kind flowing through me from my marked left palm…a familiar kind of burning pain. Then a spark flashed across my vision as I saw Kamos following in the assault and landing a hit on the robots back with his sword. I grin, my lips cracking apart, my fangs glinting, the rippling pain from my gut getting drowned by excitement.

“FUN FUN! Let me try!”

Holding him firmly against his elbow with my right arm I plan to keep him in place for at least a bit longer as I extend my left fingers in to a knife like point. Without warning and with great speed, I bring my hand upwards, aiming to jab deep in to one of it’s eye slits, the attack fueled by my high dexterity</span>

Seeing the chaos in the room, the tenno immediately aimed her arrow toward the robot that was grappling with Sonera, not sure how thick the mechs armor was, inari focused her powers, transfering energy from her mirage, into the cernos the surface of her frame shimmering slightly in the dim light of the station. 

Taking aim at the servos in the robots shoulder inari loosed the arrow, hoping she poured enough into it to put things more in Sonera&#39;s favore.</span>

Chegar dropped to the floor as the first volley was launched, trying to make himself as small a target as possible. Svytoj dropped another globe, taking a knee from behind the protective field.
Finally, inari’s call came though the COMMs.
“{Welcome back. Things are a mess.}” Svytoj called back.
“Svy, keep me covered. I want to try something.”
With that Chegar transferred from his warframe. Resting his arm on the Vaubans back, he released a concentrated beam of void energy towards the machine, making sure to stay clear or Sonera and Kamos.</span>

The android itself, startled by the strange movement and obstruction of its vision, threw its head backwards and held its arms up to protect its face. The motion unbalanced the robot, allowing Sonera’s allies’ attacks to easily land.

Inari felt a much bigger flow of energy leave her than was normal. Her mark flared into existence as well, and pulsed a beam of light which swirled itself around her arrow. The projectile screamed towards its target with seething red energy. Unlike any other weapon before it, this one was not pushed away by some unseen force, and with a wicked <em>scrunch</em> it sent the foe spinning to the ground on impact. Chegar’s void beam hit at that moment, slowly bringing its chassis to a dark red glow, but failing to have much effect. Inari’s mark faded to a content blue.

As soon as it could recover, the robot pushed itself up with its good arm a little haggardly. No one could read an expression from its ever-glaring eyes, but it was clear that it had run up upon a very disadvantageous situation. Its back was in a corner, its enemies had strange powers, and it had a shaft lodged in its mechanical deltoids.~</span>

A strong psuedo-magnetic force slammed everyone’s warframes in the chest, sending them flying backwards through the air. It didn’t matter how heavy something was, if it was made out of metal, it flew. Even non-ferromagnetic materials like the gold leaf in Chegar’s ancient orokin Vauban were strangely subject to its power. Doors and vents squealed in protest as Sonera and Inari were sent down the right hall and the rest were thrown backwards straight ahead.~</span>

“OWWW!” I let out a hiss, quickly letting go of the robot to cradle my stubbed fingers. “What glass does this thing h-“ my words were replaced by a gasp as unexpected force slammed on to me and sent me flying with a spectacular backflip. I close my eyes, waiting for the pain of the fall to ripple through me.

But

Oh? I open my eyes and find myself standing firmly on my feet, apparently somehow managing to twist myself mid air like a graceful acrobat <em>HA HAAAA! All that circus training payed off!

“We have to stop meeting like this, people will talk!” I playfully wink at her and will help her up if she needs it. I then return my attention to the bot

The shot hit, it actually struck better than she figured it would against what seemed like the heavily armoured mech. &#39;what the hel...&#39; before the thought though could be finished she felt her frame getting shoved down the hallway by a powerful force. She swore she was getting tired of being thrown around so much on this mission it was starting to fray on her nerves slightly. Hearing Sonera&#39;s quip she sighed softly, but not in any annoyed fashion. 

Extending her hand, she felt Sonera&#39;s Wukong give her a quick pull up as they stood side by side looking at the machine. &quot;Great so now what do we do with this thing?&quot;</span>

Svytoj was sent flying tumbling the opposite way through the air, barely managing to right himself before he made contact with the floor.
“Everyone okay?!” Chegar called out. Keeping his gaze on the machine that just launched his frame.
Svytoj skidded to a halt as his hands and feet touched the ground.
“Bit of a bruised chest, but I’m good.”
Chegar looked back at Sonara and inari.

Chegar immediately resumed transference,  reassuming control of his Vauban. He righted himself, and dashed towards Kamos. as the machine took off, Chegar flung a sphere at Kamos&#39; feet, deploying a bounce pad on contact. Svytoj, on the other hand, could only think of stopping the machine. He too dashed into the fray. he extended a hand and launched a bolt of frozen void energy at the machine.</span>

I dip my hand down to my marked hand, thinking. <em>It thinks, it feels...maybe</em> I close my eyes and focus, shoving aside the energy of the tenno around me for I do not need to see them as my focus flies towards the machine.

As the battle raged on within the room, Aurelia felt rooted to the spot. Unable, or perhaps unwilling as she was to risk any further damage to this all too fragile proxy. Seeing Sonera and Inari flung backwards into the very hall she currently occupied only cemented that fear. This thing was able to throw warframes around like rag dolls. What in the Void&#39;s name had she gotten herself into? &#39;Wait, Inari? How long has she been awake?&#39; She thought to herself. Curiosity itself was enough for her to risk a glance into the chamber to see the unfolding battle. 

&quot;I could attempt to use that signal again.&quot; She announced to Chegar nervously. &quot;I cannot guarantee that it will work though. I have not detected any signals like those from the MOAs from before. At worst, it may just further agitate this monstrosity.&quot;</span>

That’s when Svytoj’s ice bolt hit it in its good shoulder. It spun around and crashed into the floor.

Right. What was going on, again? Okay, he was in the air. The robot thing was down there. Other stuff was hitting it, and Sonera was probably trying to attack the thing. Honestly, Kamos still had no idea what anyone else here was doing, but hey. He had an opportunity to break more stuff. He <em>really</em> couldn&#39;t keep this up much longer after this mess of a fight, but he had at least a little bit left in him.

&quot;GET OUT OF THE WAY!&quot; Kamos called out. Deciding to use his height to his advantage, Kamos readied his sword yet <em>again</em> (Hey, if he hit it enough, it was bound to stop working eventually), and once he was as high as the bounce pad was gonna get him, he lined himself up to slam down directly on top of this thing sword-first. Now, here&#39;s hoping everyone got out of the way, because there wasn&#39;t much that was gonna stop Kamos as he started picking up speed on his way down.</span>

The confidence it seemed to exude had faded throughout the duration of the fight as the group of Tenno re-instructed it the reality of who was truly at the top of the power pyramid. Now it was frantic.

It managed to slam its free-hand on the Wukong’s head, but before it could finish the act, it looked up just in time to see Kamos’s sword descending directly into its chassis. The robot flung a hand out, but it was too late.

The Rhino’s blade slid through his enemy’s chest  and struck the floor on the other side with a sickening clang.

The robot’s eyes flickered on and off as its internals failed. More smoke spilled from the interconnection of his joints, but only succeeded in blanketing the ground in a black fog. Very slowly, its limbs fell to the cold ferrite floor.

The last thing it heard was Aurelia’s song.</span>

He drew in a deep breath of its stale air that surprisingly still functioned to reach the landing platform. His team was already moving into position to secure the entrance.

“I hear this thing was made based off one of the calls I found myself on,” a voice called out from behind.

“Perhaps, though I’m not sure you’re quite fond of it,” Red responded, turning around once again to see Dr. Art Deco slamming on a /RU brand combat helmet like it was second nature.

Deco froze for a moment, then slapped a palm against the visor of his helm.

“Fathermucker.”

Red smirked underneath his own specially designed suit. Its crimson hues flashed menacingly underneath the ghastly flood lamps. A member of his squad exited the small reception room and flashed a sign at them. It was time to move.</span>

It was dead. Actually dead. It <em>had</em> to be dead. A lot of smoke was coming out, that probably meant it was finally broken. Took long enough. For the first time in this whole mess of a fight, Kamos took a quick breather as he leaned on his sword. Energy spent, frame damaged, he probably didn&#39;t have much more in him. Good thing that the robot died when it did, right? He suppressed a cough as he stood up straight once more, looking back at the <em>absolutely</em> destroyed machine behind him. He kicked the thing, honestly a bit paranoid this time that it wasn&#39;t <em>actually</em> dead. After the proxies, the invisible thing, and whatever this thing was, he wasn&#39;t about to take any chances. Maybe <em>this</em> is what Atela was talking about when she told him to be careful. Or maybe it was something else.

&quot;Throw that thing out of an airlock.&quot; He grunted to Svytoj, ignoring Chegar&#39;s questions altogether. He was fine. Probably. A bit tired, but otherwise fine. He wasn&#39;t about to accept help like this <em>twice</em>. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything to it. Just get it out of here. <em>Now</em>.&quot;</span>

&quot;What I need is a mechanic, not a medic.&quot; The MOA complained as she limped back into the room, shaking its head in response to Kamos&#39; growls. &quot;As... cathartic as I&#39;m sure that would be, I would advise against it.

The hand smacked my forehead rather harshly, making me brit my metallic teeth in excitement, my bright eyes flashing in pure cheer. But before I could wrestle with the thing more, Kamos had to come and ruin the fun by driving a sword through the machines chest, making it stop it&#39;s wiggling. A visible pout graced my lips as I let go of the machine, straighten up and sit on it&#39;s hip 

<strong>&quot;Dead?</strong>&quot; I questioned, poking the machines forehead <strong>&quot;Is that good? Didn&#39;t the white lady say we need to capture it?</strong>&quot; I hummed under my breath, tracing my hands all down it&#39;s torso, poking my fingers in to it&#39;s nuke and crannies looking for a way to take off it&#39;s chassis and take a look at the wiring underneath.</span>

Walking up to the smoldering wreckage of the machine that she was just fighting with the others, she slipped her Cernos onto her back, listening to the conversation of the others, &#39;so next to this gigantic thing messing with us, mind catching me up one what the frack has been going on since me and Sonera touched that accursed....thing&#39; 

She paused a moment looking at the mark on the back of her frames gauntlet, wondering if she should disclose what both of them had gone through with the rest of the group, honestly it still boggled her what they went through and seeing an Orokin alive after so long....she didn&#39;t know how much detail she should go into with the rest of the Tenno in the room.</span>

Then her hand slid over its large forearm.

I mean common, something that&#39;s made so tightly and precise had to have a madman or two behind it. Who&#39;d build something like it? Unless it build itself? Can it really? 

I shake my head, chuckling to myself <em>&quot;No no, dangerous thoughts</em>&quot;  I lift my marked hand up, still sitting on it&#39;s hips. <strong>&quot;Hey hey, Inari, do you also?</strong>&quot; I lift my hand up to show her that the mark we got is glowing red again, wether that be good or not remains to be seen

&quot;Stop. Touching. It.&quot; Kamos wasn&#39;t so much interested in why Sonera and Inari seemed to be so interested in it. He was just absolutely <em>done</em> with the robot thing. May as well break it a bit more, but... He just needed a <em>second</em> to catch his breath. He wasn&#39;t tired. Totally not. Nope, he was fine, just needed a second. Why would he be tired? &quot;Just get it out of here.&quot; He mumbled, standing up straight again.

Okay, maybe he was a bit tired. That whole fight went on for a while. Heck, he wasn&#39;t sure where one fight ended and another began, with this whole situation. So much had gone wrong, but at <em>least</em> everyone seemed fine. Unless something <em>else</em> showed up and wiped the floor with everyone. Was he really <em>worried</em> about fighting again?

Hearing the questions she looked at the others in the room, &#39;it&#39;s a bit of a story folks, let&#39;s find somewhere we can hunker down..&#39; saying this she lowered her hand and nodded toward the beat up Rhino frame of Kamos, &#39;...and find a place we might be able to rest&#39;</span>

Looking down, she turned the gauntlet of her frame seeing the mark fade off, &#39;curious...&#39; she said softly, remembering that it was on her own palm as well though she wondered if it was still on her own body.

Looking around to make sure the coast is clear, she closed her eyes, gently bringing her energies back to herself as she stepped forward, from her orbiter she stepped through the gateway that was her mirage, and felt the somewhat stale air of the station, looking at everyone she waved, &#39;hello all&#39; she said simply as she turned her hand to look at her palm seeing if the mark was still on her.</span>

&quot;No scan is necessary, Sonera.&quot; Aurelia responded wearily. &quot;I assure you I&#39;ve never seen anything like that. You said it was Orokin?&quot; she asked, her voice glitching out near the end. That gave her pause. &quot;You know,&quot; she said somewhat awkwardly, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to go prepare the elevator.  I think that... thing may be interfering with this proxy&#39;s systems. She began to limp out of the room, the MOA&#39;s movements becoming less coordinated with each step.

 As she reached the door, the proxy&#39;s legs went stiff, causing the MOA to collapse on the floor. 

&quot;Wait, what!?&quot; Aurelia silently exclaimed, her now tenuous link to the proxy stifling its voice. Frantically she attempted to scan the proxy, hoping to find the cause of this disruption: a scan of it&#39;s chassis found the culprit: a particularly large piece of shrapnel, originally lodged in the hip joint, had worked its way deeper into the MOA as it had limped around, now finally puncturing its power supply. The extent of the damage made her heart sink even further. Even if  the shard was removed, the damage was done: as it stood the proxy might be online for another minute, at best.</span>

The pair moved in, looming over the disabled automaton. With a nod, Svytoj looked over at Chegar.

“Well... guess it’s autopsy time.”
“Might be difficult: Please tell me you have a set of spanners in that trauma bag.”
“It’s a <em>trauma</em> bag, kiddo. What good would spanners be?” Svytoj replied.
Chegar simply shook his head, and looked to the crowd.
“Does anyone have a tool kit on hand? Might as well take this thing apart; figure out how it works while keeping it down at the same time.”

Before anyone could answer, Svytoj turned, looking out into the hallway.

“What is it?”
“Don’t know. Wait here.” Svytoj said, walking out the door and strutting towards the elevator. It didn’t take him long to find the moa laying next to the door.

“{I’ve got a collapsed moa over here! Looks like Aurelia!}” Svytoj called out over COMMs.

“Hey! You still hearing me? {Someone get over here with some tools, maybe that robot we just put down.}” he continued, switching between trying to talk to Aurelia and call out over the radio.</span>

&quot;No.&quot; That was enough. Kamos stepped between Chegar and the disabled robot, blocking the Vauban from getting any closer. Felt like everyone was <em>ignoring</em> him. How many times did he have to tell them to stay away from it? What if it turned back on because Chegar did something wrong, after all? &quot;Stay away from it. You&#39;ll just turn it back on.&quot;

Maybe they weren&#39;t planning on doing that, but as far as Kamos was concerned, they&#39;d end up doing that by accident. Normally, he&#39;d be <em>excited</em> by the prospect of fighting something else again, but this thing was... different. He did <em>not</em> like this thing. So, he stood there, blocking Chegar. Was this a poor idea? Perhaps.</span>

Looking at her glove she felt a small sense of relief but at the same time, a sense of dread &#39;it can&#39;t be that easy&#39; she thought, she slowly unclasped the locks of her glove, pulling on each finger till she felt the fabric  slip off, pulling the glove fully off she turned her hand over, and there it was...still on her hand, though oddly it looked more like some tattoo or marking like she saw on Cetus. 

Turning to the wukong she lifted her hand up and called out, &quot;Sonera, it&#39;s still there&quot; she said, though with a not too satisfied tone in her voice.</span>

Despite the deathly stillness of the MOA, Aurelia was working feverishly to try and come up with something, anything to keep this flimsy proxy operational. Alas, it was of no use. One by one, systems within the MOA were failing, with the Cephalon behind them silently screaming in frustration all the while. It couldn&#39;t just end this way. Not after all she had had to do to get here. The amount of power within the unit was depleting rapidly, but she needed to make sure her message got through, regardless of the potential risk. Rerouting whatever power she could spare, she passed a final, curt message through the MOA&#39;s speakers:

&quot;Tell. Disruptis.My. Name.&quot; With that, the last of its power reserves ran dry, reducing the proxy to a motionless husk on the floor.</span>

Svytoj gave a low sigh. In one deft motion, he slung the powered down MOA over his shoulder, and walked back from whence he came.

Chegar looked up at Kamos, shaking his head.
“Your warframe is a <em>Rhino</em>.”Chegar said incredulously. “You want to keep it from getting up? Raise your foot above its head, bring it down hard.” He stated bluntly. “You will most likely pop the head like a grape.”
Before Chegar could say anything else, Svytoj came marching back to the group.  Aurelia’s MOA clearly slung over his shoulder.
“We’re down a man, people.” Svytoj said coldly.</span>

He didn&#39;t say anything in response, <em>partially</em> because someone carried Aurelia back in. Well, at least the MOA. Good thing, too. He wasn&#39;t sure <em>how</em> to reply to that. Truth be told, he was scared. That thing had nearly beaten him and everyone else, and it had been outnumbered. For once, he was unmatched, and that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> exciting to him. He couldn&#39;t smash his way through <em>everything</em>, yes, but they had barely taken the thing down as a group. Did he stand a chance?

With everyone hopefully focusing on the MOA and not the strange robot thing, Kamos took the chance to actually take a breather. He was still sort of feeling the effects of the thing they had fought <em>before</em> the robot, which just made it worse. Sure, he hadn&#39;t lost, but Kamos himself certainly hadn&#39;t <em>won</em>.</span>

A squad of people holding red arca plasmors with trained precision slinked into the corridor. Their crimson-and-white Corpus battle armour caught the rays of light sneaking in from outside. The units froze in place with an eye on both ends of the hall as a soldier dressed in very next-gen looking armour stepped through and assessed the situation.~</span>

The sounds of the metal shocked her for a moment as the giant bulkhead came crashing in, slipping her glove back on, she quickly stepped back toward her mirage, transfering herself to safetyas the noise of metallic footsteps filled the hallway. &quot;if it isn&#39;t one thing it&#39;s another&quot; she said under her breathe.</span>

Svytoj watched as Sonera walked towards the new, heavily armed arrivals. Both Chegar and Svytoj looked at each other, then back to Sonera as they raised their arms. 

“We are going to get shot. “ Chegar said bluntly, forgetting Kamos was standing right by him.

“Yeah, let’s hope you’re wrong.” Svytoj replied. He looked to the rest of the group.

“So... who else wants to go play ambassador?” Svytoj asked, tension finally building in his voice.</span>

The moment he heard the bulkhead fall, Kamos <em>immediately</em> glanced up and lifted his greatsword off of the ground. Maybe these strangers were here to help, but- They looked like Corpus, and given what the group of Tenno have had to put up with so far, well... He wasn&#39;t acting <em>aggressive</em> yet, but he held on tight to his weapon. Who <em>knows</em> how quickly this whole thing could go south. They looked like Corpus, they had Corpus weapons, and who knows. Maybe that robot was a proxy?

Frankly not paying much mind to being ignored by Chegar, Kamos stepped forward while Sonera shouted something at the newcomers. He didn&#39;t go to the <em>front</em> of the group, but he felt a whole lot better not being at the back. All throughout this, Kamos never spoke a word. Either because he had nothing to add to this, or he <em>really</em> just didn&#39;t want to. Probably a bit of both.</span>

“EtaForSix relax sighted,” Red subvocalized. His suit caught the coded command and passed it onto the three units to his right, marking the group of Tenno as neutral parties. The three Corpus stood upright and lowered their weapons in a sign of peace.

“AloByr check left,” Red subvocalized again. The two units on his left broke away from the formation, carefully prowling down the left hall.

Red kept his own weapon, modeled after an ancient Tenno gun classification called a ‘carbine’, close to his chest with one hand, and raised his other into the air as he approached the group of warframes.

He cleared his throat and called out to them in response to Sonera&#39;s message. “We are a ‘Response to the Unknown Corporation’ operations squad. We come in peace. Are you the group of Tenno who were assigned to this testing station?”</span>

“Might as well pack it up, kiddo.” Svytoj whispered to Chegar. “We can do an autopsy later.”
Chegar reluctantly moved away from the machine.  With that, Svytoj turned, and walked towards the new arrivals, staying behind and to the side of Kamos. Chegar leaned against one of the walls, watching the two march along.
“You two better not get us all shot.” He called out.
“Relax, kiddo. I know what we’re doin’ here.” Svytoj said cockily. He then looked back to Kamos.

“We DO know what we’re doin’... right?” He whispered, looking for any kind of response.</span>

Out of everyone, leaving this to Sonera was probably the worst choice possible. Whatever. No one else wanted to talk. Even now, Kamos hadn&#39;t put his sword away. Did he trust these newcomers enough to do that? Yeah, no. Besides, maybe it made him look more intimidating? That might be a bit helpful.

&quot;Probably.&quot; Kamos mumbled back to Svytoj. He certainly knew what <em>he</em> was doing. Maybe the others didn&#39;t. but it seemed pretty clear to Kamos. Fight a thing, kill it, get some sort of reward. Maybe that last bit was about to happen.

Red faltered for a second as Sonera mentioned a ‘white coat lady’. Almost immediately, a digitized voice chimed in on his comms.

<strong>Hyper:</strong>
“Doctor Breezy was stationed here to welcome them, sir,” it informed Red. The information came from the unit’s mission control cephalon, Hyper. His invert-chevron fractal portrait didn’t make a move to clutter Red’s hud with its face, however.

<strong>Red:</strong>
Red let out a small breath of air he had been holding. None of them was sure how much the situation had escalated, but having a few friendly Tenno around was much more welcome as opposed to facing some as enemies.

“Yes we are. My apologies to all of you, but we need to cancel the test. This entire station has been compromised. I need all of you to come with me outside, now. We’re not sure how dangerous the situation is.”

Red’s gaze moved towards the collapsed robot, then latched onto the serrated bits of metal sticking out from the holes in its chassis. “What is that?” He asked, pointing at the mechanism with his free hand.</span>

Looking back at the robot the others had fought while she had still been in the jewel, she turned her head to svytoj, since at this point she had no proper information to give,

&quot;well that&#39;s on you, i got nothing&#39;

she said under her breath, wanting to keep as much of the cards they had been dealt to themselves, especially the marks on her and Sonera&#39;s hands.</span>

“Ceph, what this?” Red subvocalized in shortspeak.

<strong>Hyper:</strong>
“I don’t have anything about it in my databanks or in the mission file. The only aggressors that should be on board are SED-08--”

<strong>Red:</strong>
“Sum seeds,” Red interrupted.

<strong>Hyper:</strong>
“Er… a large invisible creature with long claws and some sort of possessed MOAs, along with a mystical-looking octahedron,” Hyper summarized.

~As the cephalon finished his explanation, the elevator gave an eerie hum. The sound was a cacophony of screech and rumble, and it signaled that it was moving again. Two of the standing squad members immediately flanked it, keeping their plasmors trained on the doors with tightly clenched knuckles.~

<strong>Red:</strong>
Red pulled his back to the entrance and readied his own rifle. His weapon light fell on the elevator doors, desperately waiting to illuminate the contents of the mechanism once they opened. The air was stiff with tension.

“Tenno, do you have anyone else in the building?” Red called out from his position.</span>

The elevator’s warped structure wailed in protest to its quick descent. ~

<strong>Red:</strong>
Red’s shoulders were tense. His aim, steady. The elevator hit ground floor with a resounding thud in time with his thundering heartbeat. The doors flew open.

~But snagged just a couple centimeters into its opening. As the /RU operatives attempted to peer through the slit in the doors, two large hands sprung from them and seized hold of both! They were the hands of a warframe.

Leveret heaved the doors open to find himself at the barrel-end of every gun in the complex.~

<strong>Hyper:</strong>
“Units relax, friendly sighted!” Hyper called out in the implants of all operatives. He recognized that one from the file he had pulled up not 800 milliseconds ago when Svytoj mentioned another team member. Showing hostility to a Tenno was never a good thing to get caught up in.

~With incredibly trained skill, the operatives processed Hyper’s words and immediately stood down. A flash of panic shook Leveret’s stance, but before he could even process what to do the operatives were already cautiously standing with their guns across their chests. Cryogenic energy gathered in Leveret’s fists, then fizzled as he re-assessed what was happening.~</span>

Then another. And another. And another. Until seven children showed their faces in the pale flashlight glow, among them was the first child they had seen. That one, upon getting a glimpse of the people surrounding them, hurriedly broke away from the ground and ran to clutch the left leg of the /RU unit’s commander. He stiffly moved an arm around the child’s back.

“W-why?” A weak voice called out from beyond the facility’s entrance. Two new figures emerged into the halls. One was an older man with wiry grey hair wearing a helmet that featured a lot of glass to look through, who was supporting the other, a child wearing a black-and-yellow manduka suit with a closed Koppra hood.

Or wait, that wasn’t a child.

“Wh-what happened here?” the Tenno called out with a very familiar voice. It was the voice that had played inside the message that the testing group heard at the beginning of their trials. The commander turned to them, still holding the child at his waist.~

<strong>Red:</strong>
“Thank you,” he softly interjected before adjusting his composure. “Tenno, what happened here? Are there any threats still left?”</span>

“We’re not sure; we dealt with the ‘possessed’ Moas, we’re pretty sure the creature guarding the octahedron is dead, and then there’s the humanoid proxy, which was disabled before the rest of you arrived.”  Svytoj said calmly, pointing to the robot on the floor.

“Other than that, we haven’t seen anything else.” Chegar interjected.

“As for what happened, we entered the facility, began the test, spoke to the moas, dispatched the invisible creature while some inspected the artifact it was guarding, put down the proxy, had one of our teammates, Aurelia, go offline, all while trying to map out the facility.” Svytoj continued.

“As a side note, We still have their proxy; in fact, it was she in part who helped talk down the moas.” Chegar once again added. “Other than that, I believe we’re all up to date on the events of the test.”</span>

“Ceph,” Red called, not bothering to subvocalize anymore, “is there anything about the humanoid proxy--”

<strong>Hyper:</strong>
“It’s not any tech I’ve ever seen or had access to,” Hyper replied before the operative finished his sentence, “this is likely abnormal technology created by <em>something else</em>.”

<strong>Disruptis:</strong>
Disruptis left his support and staggered over to Chegar and Svytoj. As he stepped close, the marks on Inari and Sonera’s hands gave a faint glow, as if they were snarling at something. Disruptis cleared his throat.

“That mecha you just downed was not part of this test. Neither were the... children. I’m sorry for trouble, but it seems as though one of our enemies has decided to attack us. We just found out they snuck into a small portion of our command center and we’re trying to flush them out as we speak,” he informed them, running a head over the part of his suit where his forehead would be, “this entire thing devolved into a mess, but it’s good to hear you guys were able to finish it all.
